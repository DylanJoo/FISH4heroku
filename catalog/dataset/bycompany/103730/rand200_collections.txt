103730_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of our measurements and foil resistor businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ( Vishay Precision Group or VPG ) through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	In the 1950 s, Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay s founder, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Technical and Business Development Officer, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with the financial help of the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	Throughout the 1960 s and 1970 s, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	These products became part of Vishay Precision Group, which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	In the early 1990 s, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay s global market position in passive components.
103730_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business o f Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; and the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008.
103730_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	In the late 1990 s, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Vishay s next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay s acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	We also acquired several businesses as part of our Measurements Group s strategy of vertical market integration.
103730_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The measurements business became part of VPG, which was spun off on July 6, 2010.

103730_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our wet tantalum and MicroTan technologies are market leaders.
103730_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center ( DESC ), and under certain European military specifications.
103730_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	DESC qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the DESC.
103730_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product s classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	During the time that the DESC classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People s Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed dies or chips ) on each wafer.
103730_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed packages ) that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont.
103730_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People s Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel (see Israeli Government Incentives below).
103730_11_ITEM1_P62_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	The majority of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 approval and others are actively pursuing such approval.
103730_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government s grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	The current benefits derived under these programs are not material to our consolidated results.
103730_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Because of our significant presence in Israel, the availability of these incentive programs could have a significant positive effect on us if we relocate manufacturing capacity or develop new product lines in Israel.
103730_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	However, there are no substantial plans that would allow us to earn additional benefits.
103730_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Effective January 2011, the corporate tax rate in Israel will decrease.
103730_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We could be materially adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	However, we have not experienced any material interruption in our Israeli operations during our 40 years of operations there, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	If demand falls below customers forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_11_ITEM1_P79_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), electronic manufacturing services ( EMS ) companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	Excluding VPG, approximately 37% of our sales were to OEMs, approximately 56% of our sales were to distributors, and approximately 7% of our sales were to EMS companies in 2010.
103730_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating pricing and contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer s business requirements.
103730_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ( FAEs ) to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers engineering needs.
103730_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_11_ITEM1_P84_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay design-in the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_11_ITEM1_P84_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_11_ITEM1_P84_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 66% of our total net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM1_P85_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM1_P85_S4	No single OEM customer comprises more than 5% of our total net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:
103730_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	MOSFETs: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, International Rectifier, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Diodes: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	Optoelectronic Components: Avago, Rohm, Sharp, Toshiba.
103730_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	Resistors and Inductors: KOA, Panasonic, Rohm, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Capacitors: AVX, KEMET, Murata, Nichicon, Panasonic, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	There are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete.
103730_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability, technological innovation, business reputation, and price competitiveness.
103730_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and scientists.
103730_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People s Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity s or individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_11_ITEM1_P103_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_11_ITEM1_P103_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) at Superfund sites.
103730_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_11_ITEM1_P107_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_11_ITEM1_P107_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_11_ITEM1_P107_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_11_ITEM1_P108_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_11_ITEM1_P108_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_11_ITEM1_P108_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 22,600 full time employees, of whom approximately 90% were located outside the United States.
103730_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_11_ITEM1_P109_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions.
103730_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_11_ITEM1_P111_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_11_ITEM1_P111_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_11_ITEM1_P112_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_11_ITEM1_P112_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_11_ITEM1_P112_S3	To view the reports, access ir.vishay.com and click on SEC Filings.
103730_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	To view these documents, access ir.vishay.com and click on Corporate Governance.
103730_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf:
103730_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and the periods of decline we experienced in the recent past may resume and may become more pronounced.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	While we believe that a recovery from the recent global downturn is underway, there is no assurance that the recovery will continue at its current pace or at all, or that the conditions that contributed to the recent recessionary environment have in fact abated.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A decline in product demand on a global basis could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our pro ducts, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P2_S6	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we attempt to reduce our cost structure through restructuring activities.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This includes acquisition-related restructuring, where we attempt to streamline the operations of companies we acquire and achieve synergies between our acquisitions and our existing businesses.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	It also includes restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We recorded restructuring and severance costs, plus related asset write-downs, in each year from 2001 to 2009 and expect to incur some level of future restructuring costs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	However, we did not incur any restructuring expenses in 2010 and do not anticipate any material restructuring expenses in 2011.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As a result of our restructuring activities initiated during the global economic recession, which began in the latter half of 2008 and continued into 2009, we, like many in our industry, were unable to expand our manufacturing to satisfy the intense demand from our customers and were unable to fill all of their orders in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2010 due to factors such as delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment and shortages of skilled personnel.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we continue to be unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $432 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to our share repurchase activity that was funded through the issuance of convertible senior debentures.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash balances will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We are also restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P20_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	F or periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We cannot assure you that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Also, to assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the global economic recession.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion at our facilities.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Although we have never been involved in any envi ronmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our products may experience a reduction in product classification levels under various military specifications.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If any of our products fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, that product s classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P35_S4	A decrease in the classification level for any of our products with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We obtain substantial benefits by operating in Israel, but these benefits may not continue.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government s grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	There can also be no assurance that in the future the Israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that, if it does, such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to benefit from them.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Any significant increase in the Israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the Israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low, but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through maintaining manufacturing operations in countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People s Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Shifting operations to low-labor-cost countries could result in under-utilization of certain plants and factories in high-labor-cost countries and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	This under-utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	These costs include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher-labor-cost countries, and start-up expenses, manufacturing and construction delays, and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, shifting operations could result in strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in high-labor-cost countries.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have operations outside the United States, and approximately 77% of our revenues during 2010 (excluding VPG) were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Some of our products are produced in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 40 years.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	However, we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P48_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Currently, the holders of Class B common stock hold approximately 48.5% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Directly, through family trusts, and as voting trustee under a voting trust agreement, Dr. Felix Zandman, our Executive Chairman and Chief Technical and Business Development Officer, has sole or shared voting power over substantially all of the outstanding Class B common stock.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	As a result, the holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors would need to consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In particular, our Board of Directors believes that it is in our best interest to ensure the continued vision and influence of our founder, Dr. Felix Zandman, over our corporate affairs.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Dr. Zandman currently has effective voting control over our company through our Class B common stock, by direct ownership, family trusts, and a voting trust agreement, such that he has approximately 48.5% of our outstanding voting power.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P55_S5	The reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by poss ible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If the VPG spin-off transaction is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax could incur substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The VPG spin-off transaction was conditioned upon Vishay s receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) and an opinion of tax counsel (the Opinion ) confirming that the VPG spin-off transaction should qualify as tax-free to us and our stockholders.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, and representations from us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies businesses and other matters.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Any inaccuracy in these facts, assumptions, or representations could invalidate the ruling, and we and our stockholders could be subject to substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and Opinion, the IRS or state or local tax authorities (collectively with the IRS, the Tax Authorities ) could determine on audit that the VPG spin-off transaction should be treated as a taxable transaction if the Tax Authorities determine that any of these facts, assumptions, or representations are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of our company or VPG after the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Under the tax matters agreement between our company and VPG, VPG generally would be required to indemnify our company against its taxes resulting from the failure of the VPG spin-off transaction to qualify as tax-free ( Transaction Taxes ) as a result of (i) any action by VPG or any of its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would reasonably be expected to prevent the spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction to us and our stockholders (ii) any action by VPG or its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would be inconsistent with any material information or representation made in connection with the private letter ruling obtained by us from the IRS and/or with the Opinion or (iii) certain other actions taken by VPG.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	However, in the event that Transaction Taxes are incurred for any other reason, we would not be entitled to indemnification.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In addition, due to the potential impact of significant stock ownership changes on the taxability of the spin-off to us, we and VPG may determine not to enter into transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, such as issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs or acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities, if such issuances would exceed certain thresholds and such actions could be considered part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion .
103730_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Vishay Precision Group has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the Vishay mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The license of the Vishay name to Vishay Precision Group is important because we anticipate that the success of Vishay Precision Group will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by Vishay Precision Group could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, and that any negative publicity associated with a product o r service of Vishay Precision Group following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our business has approximately 42 manufacturing locations.
103730_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.

103730_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
103730_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.

103730_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	In January 2005, an amended class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California on behalf of all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix against Vishay, Ernst Young LLP (the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company s financial statements), Dr. Felix Zandman, Executive Chairman and Chief Technical and Business Development Officer of Vishay, and as a nominal defendant, Siliconix.
103730_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	The suit made various claims against Vishay and the other defendants for actions allegedly taken in respect of Siliconix during the period when Vishay owned an 80.4% interest in Siliconix.
103730_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	The action, which we refer to as the Proctor litigation on account of the lead plaintiff, sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
103730_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	In May 2005, Vishay successfully completed a tender offer to acquire all shares of Siliconix that were not already owned by Vishay.
103730_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	Following the announcement of Vishay s intent to make this tender offer, several purported class-action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
103730_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	These actions were consolidated into a single class action and a settlement agreement was reached with the plaintiffs, who effectively represented all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix.
103730_11_ITEM3_P4_S3	The settlement agreement was approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery in October 2005.
103730_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	The plaintiffs in the Proctor litigation filed an amended complaint in the Superior Court of California in November 2005.
103730_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	In June 2006, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a permanent injunction restraining the Proctor plaintiffs from prosecuting the Proctor action.
103730_11_ITEM3_P5_S2	An appeal of the injunction order brought by a former stockholder of Siliconix was dismissed by the Delaware Supreme Court in January 2007.
103730_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	Also in June 2006, the Proctor litigation was removed from the Superior Court of California to federal District Court there.
103730_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	The District Court granted a motion by Ernst Young to dismiss the complaint and a motion by Vishay for summary judgment, effective October 15, 2007.
103730_11_ITEM3_P6_S2	The Proctor plaintiffs thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
103730_11_ITEM3_P6_S3	On October 9, 2009, the Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the dismissal of Proctor s class action claim and remanded the remaining two claims to state court.
103730_11_ITEM3_P6_S4	On February 10, 2011, the Superior Court ruled in Vishay s favor, but granted the plaintiff twenty days to amend its complaint.
103730_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	Vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by Vishay and its subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) at Superfund sites.
103730_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.

103730_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	For several years, we have been implementing aggressive cost reduction programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	We continue to monitor the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges in Part I.
103730_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net debt (cash), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The improvement in global economic conditions experienced in the current year has increased overall demand for our products and the effects of the cost reductions initiated in the prior years has resulted in significant overall improvements in all key financial metrics in 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2.725 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.042 billion and $2.822 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $359.1 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, compared to a net losses attributable to Vishay stockholders of $57.2 million, or $0.31 per share, and $1,732.2 million, or $9.29 per share, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The year ended December 31, 2010 includes $59.5 million of one-time tax benefits, primarily related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances in the United States and Israel.

103730_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	The reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), including adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share.
103730_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
103730_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share do not have uniform definitions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled me asures used by other companies.
103730_11_ITEM7_P9_S5	Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_11_ITEM7_P9_S6	Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Includes add-back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive.

103730_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Including the loss from discontinued operations, the net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,732.2 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010 represent the continuation of the upturn of our business due to increased overall demand for electronic components over the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the effects of the cost reductions initiated in the prior years that enabled us to achieve significantly higher earnings than before the beginning of the global economic recession, at similar sales volume.
103730_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our results for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were substantially impacted by the global economic recession.
103730_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Due to our quick reaction to the recession, we mitigated the loss of volume that we experienced through significant reductions of fixed costs and inventories, we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during the recession, and following several quarters of experiencing losses we began to recover from the global economic recession and produced positive net earnings beginning in the thir d fiscal quarter of 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	We also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices ( ASP ).
103730_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenue s, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	If demand falls below customers forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The inventory balance used for computation of this ratio includes tantalum inventories in excess of a one year supply, which are classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	We analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, the inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 and through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net revenues include VPG through the second fiscal quarter of 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	See Financial Metrics by Segment for further information on VPG net revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	End-of-period backlog includes backlog attributable to VPG of $32.7 million, $36.2 million, and $38.4 million for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, first fiscal quarter of 2010, and second fiscal quarter of 2010, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	See Financial Metrics by Segment below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	We experienced the continuation of an excellent business environment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 with results mirroring those of the third fiscal quarter of 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	As expected, our business began to normalize in the fourth fiscal quarter as significant shortages of supplies have been filled and backlogs, mainly at distributors, are being corrected.
103730_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Despite the normalization that is occurring, the favorable pricing environment continued as average selling prices increased versus the third fiscal quarter of 2010 and fourth fiscal quarter of 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	The favorable pricing environment and continued high levels of overall market demand for electronic components allowed us to continue our strong revenue generation at the level achieved in the third fiscal quarter and increase net revenues over the previous quarters, excluding VPG.
103730_11_ITEM7_P30_S4	Net revenues exclusive of VPG for the second and first fiscal quarters of 2010 and fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 were $648.7 million, $592.3 million, and $560.1 million, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Due to the pre-crisis sales volume, favorable pricing environment, and continued low fixed costs resulting from the restructuring implemented in prior periods and our on-going cost controlling initiatives, gross margins remained at historically high levels.
103730_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The decrease in the book-to-bill ratio underlines the normalization of our business that we are experiencing.
103730_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Due in part to the normalization of orders and increases in average sales prices in the fourth fiscal quarter, the book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.83 from 1.04 in the third fiscal quarter of 2010 despite continued strong overall volume demand for our products.
103730_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) were 0.71 and 0.97, respectively, versus ratios of 0.95 and 1.16, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	We expect our current revenue trends to continue despite the decrease in the book-to-bill ratio due to historically high backlogs and a recent improvement in orders for our products.
103730_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earn ings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ).
103730_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	For these purposes, we will calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay s four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We did not announce or complete any acquisitions in 2009 or 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	We completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. in 2010 and completed three strategic acquisitions in 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	We also divested certain non-core businesses acquired in the 2008 transactions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	On October 27, 2009, we announced that we intended to spin off our measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and our Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Upon completion of the spin-off, certain executive officers received bonuses aggregating approximately $2.1 million, which is reflected in the results for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows are included in the balances reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The product lines that comprise VPG are included in the VPG reporting segment.
103730_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	See Note 15 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the effect that VPG had on our consolidated results.
103730_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	During 2008, we made three acquisitions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	On June 30, 2008, we acquired our partner s 51% interest in a transducer manufacturing joint venture in India for approximately $9.6 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	On July 23, 2008, we acquired Powertron GmbH, a manufacturer of specialty precision resistors, for approximately $14.3 million, including the repayment of certain debt of Powertron.
103730_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	On September 15, 2008, we acquired the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation for $35.2 million and other consideration in the form of a three-year term loan of $15 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	On May 5, 2010, KEMET prepaid the entire principal amount of the term loan plus interest.
103730_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	As further described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, during 2008, we made an unsolicited offer to acquire all outstanding shares of International Rectifier Corporation ( International Rectifier ).
103730_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	This tender offer was terminated on October 13, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	We incurred $4.0 million of costs associated with the International Rectifier tender offer, which are presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	In April 2007, we acquired the PCS business of International Rectifier.
103730_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	On April 7, 2008, we sold the automotive modules and subsystems business unit ( ASBU ) we had acquired as part of the acquisition of the PCS business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	During the first fiscal quarter of 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $32.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the net assets of ASBU to the selling price.
103730_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	We recorded an additional after tax loss of $5.7 million during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 subsequent to the resolution of a net working capital adjustment and the resolution of certain disputes with the buyer.
103730_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	In June 2009, International Rectifier refunded $30.0 million of the purchase price associated with the acquisition as part of a settlement agreement.
103730_11_ITEM7_P44_S5	As all goodwill associated with the PCS business was written off as part of the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008 (see Note 3), we recorded a gain of $28.2 million during the second quarter of 2009, equal to the amount received pursuant to the settlement agreement less certain related expenses.
103730_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products, particularly our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry and inflation drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Our variable cost reduction efforts include expending capital to increase automation and maximize the efficiency in our production facilities, consolidating materials purchasing across regions and divisions to achieve economies of scale, materials substitution, maintaining an appropriate mix of in-house production and subcontractor production, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	After the spin-off of VPG, we seek to maintain selling, general, and administrative expenses at current quarterly levels, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our fixed cost control efforts include automating administrative processes through the expansion of IT systems, gradually migrating to common IT systems across our organization, streamlining our legal entity structure, and reducing our external resource needs by utilizing more cost-effective in-house personnel, while utilizing external resources when day-to-day expertise is not required in-house.
103730_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People s Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The percentage of our total headcount in lower-labor-cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we were successful in implementing this program.
103730_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	This percentage was 76.5% at the end of 2010 as compared to 74.6% at the end of both 2009 and 2008, and 57% when this program began in 2001.
103730_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We believe that our workforce is now appropriately located to serve our customers, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Between 2001 and 2007, we recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs totaling $223 million and related asset write-downs totaling $81 million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward.
103730_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	We also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	In response to the economic downturn which began during the latter half of 2008 and continued into 2009, we undertook significant measures to cut costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	This included a strict adaptation of manufacturing capacity to sellable volume, limiting the building of product for inventory, headcount reductions in virtually every facility and every country in which we operated, temporary layoffs and shutdowns, minimizing the use of foundries and subcontractors in order to maximize the load of our owned facilities, as well as selected plant closures.
103730_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	We closed two facilities in the United States and consolidated manufacturing for these product lines into other facilities.
103730_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	We also consolidated our optoelectronics packaging facilities in Asia.
103730_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	We successfully closed a film capaci tor plant in Shanghai and increased production on existing equipment in Loni, India to replace the production volume of the closed plant.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	We incurred restructuring and severance costs of $62.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, including $28.6 million during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, and incurred additional restructuring and severance costs of $37.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	These costs were incurred as part of our goal to reduce manufacturing and SG A fixed costs in 2009 by $200 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 in response to the global economic downturn.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our fixed costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $176 million versus the comparable prior year.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Of these amounts, approximately 45% reduced costs of products sold and approximately 55% reduced SG A expenses.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	Some of our cost reductions realized in 2009 were the result of temporary measures, which we replaced with more permanent actions, and certain components of our costs, while fixed in that they do not vary with changes in volum e, are subject to volatility.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S5	This would include, for example, the effect of certain assets that are marked-to-market through the statement of operations, and certain transactions in foreign currencies.
103730_11_ITEM7_P52_S6	Accordingly, there is no assurance that all of the cost reductions achieved in 2009 will be maintained in future periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We have realized, and expect to continue to realize, significant annual net cost savings associated with our restructuring activities.
103730_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Since the latter half of 2008, we drastically reduced our break-even point by approximately $450 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	While streamlining and reducing fixed overhead, we exercised caution so that we will not negatively impact our customer service or our ability to further develop products and processes.
103730_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	The risks associated with our cost reduction programs are further detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
103730_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	We did not initiate any new restructuring projects in 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during the year.
103730_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Because we believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, we do not anticipate any material restructuring expenses in 2011.
103730_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	However, the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our long-term strategy is to grow through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses if we were to complete an acquisition.
103730_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government s grants and tax incentive programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	These benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the United States.
103730_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in prior years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The current benefits derived under these programs are not material to our consolidated results.
103730_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Because of our significant presence in Israel, the availability of these incentive programs could have a significant positive effect on us if we relocate manufacturing capacity or develop new product lines in Israel.
103730_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	However, there are no current plans that would allow us to earn significant additional benefits.
103730_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Effective January 2011, the corporate tax rate in Israel will decrease.
103730_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	For much of 2008, these metals were trading near all-time record-high prices.
103730_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2008, as metals prices declined significantly from these record-high prices, we entered into commitments to purchase a portion of our estimated 2009 metals needs, principally for copper and palladium.
103730_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	After entering into these commitments, the market prices for these metals continued to decline.
103730_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	As a result, we recorded losses on these adverse purchase commitments during the fourth quarter of 2008 totaling $6.0 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our Siliconix subsidiary maintains long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity.
103730_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In 2004, Siliconix signed a definitive long-term foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with Tower Semiconductor (the 2004 Tower agreement ), pursuant to which Siliconix would purchase semiconductor wafers from and transfer certain technologies to Tower Semiconductor.
103730_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Fab 1 facility over a seven to ten year period.
103730_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The 2004 Tower agreement specified minimum quantities per month and a fixed quantity for the term of the agreement.
103730_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	Siliconix was required to pay for any short-fall in minimum order quantities specified under the agreement through the payment of penalties equal to unavoidable fixed costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	In March 2008, Siliconix and Tower entered into an amended and restated foundry agreement (the 2008 Tower agreement ).
103730_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Pursuant to the 2008 Tower agreement, Tower continued to manufacture wafers covered by the 2004 Tower agreement, but at lower quantities and at lower prices, through 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	Tower also manufactures wafers for other product lines acquired as part of the PCS acquisition through 2012.
103730_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Siliconix must pay for any short-fall in the reduced minimum order quantities specified under the 2008 Tower agreement through the payment of penalties equal to unavoidable fixed costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The foundry agreement with Tower was further amended in March 2009, further reducing the quantity of commitments.
103730_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	As consideration, Siliconix paid $3 million to Tower, which was recorded as a component of cost of products sold.
103730_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	A portion of this payment would be refunded if orders exceed the minimum order commitment.
103730_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we have been refunded the full amount of this payment, which has been recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold.
103730_11_ITEM7_P66_S4	In 2010, Siliconix amended its agreement with Tower to extend through the second fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	While we have in the past used forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures, we generally have not done so in recent periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the functional currency of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	A subsidiary s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company s operations generally would have the parent company s currency as its functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
103730_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	The dollar generally was stronger in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus the comparable prior year periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P72_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 have been slightly favorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their fun ctional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk.
103730_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	We have modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products, which we term a scrap allowance.
103730_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a stock, ship and debit program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors f or credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue redu ction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_11_ITEM7_P78_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	We recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	We earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by Vishay management that we believe are reasonable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	However, it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Due to Vishay s large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_11_ITEM7_P83_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_11_ITEM7_P83_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_11_ITEM7_P84_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	After entering into commitments to purchase a portion of our estimated 2009 metals needs, principally for copper and palladium, the market prices for these metals declined below our contractually obligated purchase price.
103730_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	As a result, we recorded losses on these adverse purchase commitments during the fourth quarter of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	These losses, which aggregate to $6.0 million, are recorded on a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our restructuring activities are designed to reduce both fixed and variable costs in our existing and acquired entities.
103730_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	Restructuring costs, including acquisition-related restructuring costs, are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs, and all of the requirements for accrual are met.
103730_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	We did not initiate any new restructuring projects in 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during the year.
103730_11_ITEM7_P86_S3	In 2009 and 2008, we recorded restructuring and severance costs of approximately $37.9 million and $62.5 million, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Because these costs are recorded based upon estimates, our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	If this happens, we will have to adjust our estimates in future periods, either by recording additional expenses in future periods, if our initial estimates were too low, or by reversing part of the charges that we recorded initially, if our initial estimates were too high.
103730_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	In the first step, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_11_ITEM7_P89_S3	The comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are generally the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance graph in Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
103730_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	In step two, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired those business units.
103730_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	Specifically, we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
103730_11_ITEM7_P90_S2	The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two.
103730_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Fair value of reporting units, and the underlying assets and liabilities of those reporting units, is measured at a point in time, and reflects specific market conditions as of the measurement date.
103730_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	We performed our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization that we and our peer group companies experienced in each successive quarter of 2008, and other factors, we determined that impairment tests were necessary as of the end of the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008, and recorded goodwill impairment charges in each of those quarters.
103730_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	The interim test performed as of the last day of the third fiscal quarter of 2008, was effectively our annual impairment test for 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	Subsequent to recording these impairment charges, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	In total, we recorded goodwill impairment charg es aggregating $1,696.2 million in year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	The goodwill impairment charge is noncash in nature and did not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	We assess the impairment of our long-lived assets, other than goodwill and tradenames, including property and equipment, long-term prepaid assets, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and evaluated as a group.
103730_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets, changes in historical or projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends.
103730_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the f air market value of the long-lived asset group, primarily determined using discounted future cash flows.
103730_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (which for us are comprised entirely of tradenames) are not amortized, but similar to goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	These tests are performed more frequently if there are triggering events.
103730_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment during the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008, we performed a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	As a result of those assessments, we recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges totaling $27 million during the third fiscal quarter of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	There was no impairment identified through the annual impairment tests completed in 2010 or 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	We did not record any fixed asset write-downs during the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded asset write-downs of $0.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Fixed asset write-downs included amounts to reduce the carrying value of certain buildings which had been vacated as part of our restructuring activities, based on expected future selling prices or the present value of expected rental receipts.
103730_11_ITEM7_P103_S3	Fixed asset write-downs also included charges to write down certain equipment to salvage value after we determined that it would not be used at other Vishay locations subsequent to the completion of our restructuring plans.
103730_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P107_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_11_ITEM7_P107_S4	We use independent actuaries to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_11_ITEM7_P107_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	Plans in these countries comprise approximately 95% of our retirement obligations at December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_11_ITEM7_P109_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Within the U.S., we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk.
103730_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	The difference between this expect ed return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	We expect net periodic pension cost in 2011 to approximate net periodic pension cost recognized in 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions will be required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	As a result of these amendments, net periodic pension cost for 2010 and 2009 did not include any service cost, thus partially offsetting the increases due to increased amortization of actuarial losses and lower expected returns on plan assets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, we increased the company-match portion of our 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
103730_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_11_ITEM7_P118_S2	These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P118_S3	We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	These accruals are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.
103730_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	We file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as income tax returns in multiple U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examinations of Vishay s U.S. federal tax returns for all tax years through 2002.
103730_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	Because of net operating losses, our U.S. federal tax returns for 2003 and later years remain subject to examination.
103730_11_ITEM7_P120_S3	Examinations of most principal subsidiaries in Israel through the 2007 tax year were concluded in 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P120_S4	The tax returns of significant non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently under examination in Germany (2005 through 2008), India (2004 through 2009), China (2006 through 2009), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2000 through 2008).
103730_11_ITEM7_P120_S5	We and our subsidiaries are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	We account for uncertainty in income tax positions using the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as prescribed in GAAP.
103730_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
103730_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_11_ITEM7_P122_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	In 2010, we reversed $57.9 million of valuation allowances in the U.S. and Israel, resulting in a one-time tax benefit.
103730_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	In January 2011, a new tax law was enacted in Israel which effectively lowers the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after December 31, 2 010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	Accordingly, our deferred tax assets in Israel will be written down to reflect the lower tax rate, and we anticipate a one-time tax expense in the first fiscal quarter of 2011 of approximately $10 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Substantially all earnings generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Statement of operations captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The recovery of our business that we began experiencing in the second half of 2009 continued throughout 2010 due to historically high overall demand for electronic components, a favorable pricing environment, and the effects of our restructuring programs initiated in the prior year and our on-going cost controlling programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	Our results have dramatically improved versus our 2009 results, which were substantially impacted by the global economic recession.
103730_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	Despite some normalization of our business in the fourth fiscal quarter, overall demand remains strong especially in the automotive segment.
103730_11_ITEM7_P129_S3	We expect our current revenue levels to continue despite the slight decline in the book-to-bill ratio due to high backlogs for our products and recent increases in orders.
103730_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	All regions and virtually all of our end markets were heavily impacted by the global economic recession, which was seen in the decline in sales volume in 2009 compared to 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	The relatively stronger U.S. dollar further decreased the amount reported for revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 versus the year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	During the second half of 2009, we experienced the beginning of the world economic and electronics market recovery across all geographies, all markets, and all sales channels that continued throughout 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_11_ITEM7_P132_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $71.8 million, $59.6 million, and $77.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales 2.6%, 2.8%, and 2.7%, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P132_S4	Actu al credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were approximately $60.9 million, $67.5 million, and $79.9 million, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P132_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $5.8 million, $5.7 million, and $3.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 29.6%, as compared to 19.0% for year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	The gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 29.4% excluding VPG.
103730_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	This increase in gross profit margin reflects manufacturing efficiencies from significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs initiated in prior years.
103730_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2009 were 19.0%, as compared to 21.2% for year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	This decrease in gross profit margin reflects significantly lower volume, lower average selling prices, and a less favorable product mix, which was partially offset by fixed cost reductions, positive foreign currency effects, and generally lower precious metals and raw materials costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the MOSFETs segment was as follows:
103730_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, improved product mix, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009 reflects significantly lower volume and lower average selling prices, partially offset by the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Our MOSFETs segment suffered significantly from low sales volume during the global economic recession.
103730_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	Following several quarters of accelerated recovery, the business has been quickly normalizing after reaching pre-crisis levels of manufacturing and sales in the third fiscal quarter of 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	Strong demand, shortages of supply, and customer requested expedites have led to price increases versus the prior year, while the normalization of leadtimes and backlog have led to price decreases versus the third fiscal quarter as the competitive nature of the business starts to prevail again.
103730_11_ITEM7_P141_S3	We expect segment net revenues to be seasonally weaker in the first fiscal quarter of 2011.
103730_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Diodes segment was as follows:
103730_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, improved product mix, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009 reflects significantly lower volume and lower average selling prices, partially offset by the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	Our Diodes segment suffered significantly from low sales volume during the global economic recession.
103730_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	Following the substantial recovery, the business has normalized after reaching pre-economic crisis level of sales in the second fiscal quarter of 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P146_S2	Despite distributors adapting their backlog to shorter leadtimes, the backlog remains very high.
103730_11_ITEM7_P146_S3	Strong demand, shortages of supply, and customer requested expedites have led to price increases versus the prior year and prior quarter.
103730_11_ITEM7_P146_S4	Despite a book-to-bill ratio below 1.0 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we continue to expect strong segment net revenues due to a very high backlog.
103730_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Optoelectronic Components segment was as follows:
103730_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, improved product mix, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs, partially offset by modestly lower average selling prices and exchange rate effects.
103730_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009 reflects significantly lower volume and lower average selling prices, partially offset by the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	Our Optoelectronic Components segment suffered significantly from low sales volume during the global economic recession.
103730_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	Following the substantial recovery, the business has normalized after reaching pre-economic crisis levels.
103730_11_ITEM7_P151_S2	Average selling prices have stabilized as indicated by a slight decrease versus the prior year, but increases versus the third fiscal quarter of 2010 and fourth fiscal quarter of 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P151_S3	Despite a book-to-bill ratio below 1.0 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we continue to expect strong segment net revenues due to a high backlog.
103730_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors and Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Changes in Resistors and Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Resistors and Inductors segment was as follows:
103730_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs, and improved product mix, partially offset by foreign currency effects.
103730_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	The increase in gross margin from 2008 to 2009 is due to lower fixed costs, partially offset by lower volume and slightly lower average selling prices.
103730_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	In light of the economic challenges experienced in 2009, our Resistors and Inductors segment maintained a respectable gross margin percentage.
103730_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	Average selling prices have been generally stable versus the prior year and have slightly increased versus the third fiscal quarter of 2010 and fourth fiscal quarter of 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P156_S2	The business has achieved pre-economic crisis sales levels and continues to enjoy strong demand from the automotive and industrial markets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P156_S3	Despite a book-to-bill ratio below 1.0 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we continue to expect strong segment net revenues due to a high backlog.
103730_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Capacitors segment was as follows:
103730_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	Significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs, partially offset by foreign currency effects, have led to the increase in gross margin from 2009 to 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	The increase in gross margin from 2008 to 2009 is due to lower fixed costs and higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volume.
103730_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	In light of the economic challenges experienced in 2009, our Capacitors segment maintained a respectable gross margin percentage.
103730_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	Continued strong demand, shortages of supply, and customer requested expedites have led to substantial price increases versus the prior year and third fiscal quarter of 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P161_S2	The business has achieved pre-economic crisis sales levels and continues to enjoy strong demand from the automotive and industrial markets.
103730_11_ITEM7_P161_S3	Despite the normalization of the backlog that began in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, the backlog remains very high.
103730_11_ITEM7_P161_S4	Despite a book-to-bill ratio below 1.0 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we continue to expect strong segment net revenues due to the very high backlog.
103730_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	We completed the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P162_S1	Net revenues and gross margin percentage for the periods that VPG was included in our consolidated results were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ( SG A ) expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	VPG accounted for $35.4 million (including $8.4 million of costs associated with the spin-off) of SG A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $43.4 million and $51.7 million, respectively, of SG A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	The overall increase in SG A expenses, excluding VPG, in the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the resumption of bonus programs and the discontinuation of short-work and temporary shut-downs, which is partially offset by the effects of our cost controlling initiatives.
103730_11_ITEM7_P164_S2	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increase in revenues and the effects of our cost controlling initiatives.
103730_11_ITEM7_P164_S3	The overall decrease in total SG A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2009 versus the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to our cost controlling initiatives.
103730_11_ITEM7_P164_S4	T he increase in SG A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues.
103730_11_ITEM7_P164_S5	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	The decrease in amortization expense from 2009 to 2010 is principally due to the distribution of intangible assets to VPG in connection with the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM7_P165_S1	The increase in amortization expense from 2008 to 2009 is principally due to the initiation of amortization of certain tradenames after determining that these intangible assets were impaired and no longer should be considered indefinite-lived during the third fiscal quarter of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	The transition services agreements were associated with our acquisition of the PCS business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	Of the $7.6 million net gains on sales of assets in 2008, approximately $4.5 million was realized in a single transaction.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	We did not initiate any new restructuring programs during the year ended December 31, 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during the year.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S1	Our restructuring activities in prior years were designed to reduce both fixed and variable costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S2	These activities included the closing of facilities and the termination of employees.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S3	Because costs are recorded based upon estimates, actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S4	If the initial estimates are too low or too high, we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse previously recorded expenses.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S5	We anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P168_S6	Due to our acquisition strategy, we expect to continue to incur some level of future restructuring expenses, but do not anticipate any material restructuring expenses during 2011 as explained in Cost Management above and in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $0.7 million versus the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2040 that were issued on November 9, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line Other on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $28.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	The decrease is primarily due to the repayment of the convertible subordinated notes on August 1, 2008 and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt.
103730_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line Other on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate was 11.2%.
103730_11_ITEM7_P173_S1	The effective tax rate is less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
103730_11_ITEM7_P173_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we recorded a negative effective tax rate, tax expense on a pre-tax loss, primarily because we recorded tax expense on earnings in certain jurisdictions while realizing losses in other jurisdictions without recording tax benefits.
103730_11_ITEM7_P173_S3	The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were -42.3% and -0.7%, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge of $57.8 million discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P174_S1	We recorded no tax expense associated with the gain of $28.2 million recognized upon reimbursement of purchase price described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, actual and anticipated repatriation of cash to the United States, and other related items.
103730_11_ITEM7_P175_S1	These items total $(59.5) million (tax benefit), $2.0 million, and $36.9 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	Additionally, the relatively low effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was principally attributable to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P176_S1	The vast majority of our goodwill was not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_11_ITEM7_P176_S2	We recognized tax benefits of $55.2 million during 2008, associated with the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges.
103730_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	In connection with the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes on August 1, 2008, we repatriated approximately $250 million of cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, incurring additional tax expense.
103730_11_ITEM7_P177_S1	Substantially all cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_11_ITEM7_P178_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_11_ITEM7_P178_S2	Part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_11_ITEM7_P178_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate.
103730_11_ITEM7_P178_S4	Changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	The effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 reflect the fact that we could not recognize for accounting purposes the tax benefit of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions, although these losses may be available to offset future taxable income.
103730_11_ITEM7_P179_S1	Under applicable accounting guidance, we may not recognize deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where there is a recent history of cumulative losses, where there is no taxable income in the carryback period, where there is insufficient evidence of future earnings to overcome the loss history and where there is no other positive evidence, such as the likely reversal of taxable temporary differences, that would result in the utilization of loss carryforwards for tax purposes.
103730_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	Following the significant upturn in the economy in 2010 and the issuance of convertible debentures in November 2010, we were able to reverse some of these valuation allowances.
103730_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_11_ITEM7_P182_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy and to reduce debt levels.
103730_11_ITEM7_P182_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 9 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 16 years.
103730_11_ITEM7_P182_S3	A portion of the cash flows from operations was generated by the Vishay Precision Group which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P183_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as free cash, a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions and repay debt.
103730_11_ITEM7_P183_S1	Vishay has generated positive free cash in each of the past 14 years, and free cash in excess of $80 million in each of the past 9 years.
103730_11_ITEM7_P183_S2	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_11_ITEM7_P184_S0	We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations and free cash during the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P184_S1	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if, among other things, the current recovery stalls or does not continue as expected.
103730_11_ITEM7_P185_S0	During 2010, we capitalized on favorable credit market conditions and our business performance to secure new financing and repurchase shares of our common stock.
103730_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	On November 3, 2010, we announced the offering of $275 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior debentures due 2040 to qualified institutional investors.
103730_11_ITEM7_P186_S1	We used the net proceeds from this offering, together with new net borrowings under our credit facility and cash on hand, to repurchase 21,721,959 shares of common stock at $12.66 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $275 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P186_S2	The use of low-coupon, long-dated convertible debentures was a more efficient means to finance the repurchase versus repatriation of non-U.S. cash.
103730_11_ITEM7_P186_S3	The transactions closed on November 9, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P186_S4	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	On December 1, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank ( 2010 Credit Facility ).
103730_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	On December 1, 2010, we borrowed $240 million under the 2010 Credit Facility to repay the outstanding amounts under our previously existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks led by Comerica Bank ( Comerica Facility ) that was scheduled to expire on April 20, 2012.
103730_11_ITEM7_P188_S1	The 2010 Credit Facility provides a revolving commitment of up to $450 million through December 1, 2015.
103730_11_ITEM7_P188_S2	The 2010 Facility also provides for the ability for us to request up to $100 million of incremental commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P188_S3	At December 31, 2010, $240 million was outstanding under the 2010 Credit Facility.
103730_11_ITEM7_P188_S4	At December 31, 2009, we had a term loan balance of $87.5 million and $125.0 million outstanding under the Comerica Facility.
103730_11_ITEM7_P189_S0	Borrowings under the 2010 Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_11_ITEM7_P189_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our then current leverage ratio.
103730_11_ITEM7_P189_S2	Based on our leverage ratio at December 1, 2010, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%.
103730_11_ITEM7_P189_S3	We are also required to pay facility commitment fees of 0.35% per annum on the entire commitment amount.
103730_11_ITEM7_P190_S0	The borrowings under the 2010 Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets located in the United States, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, and bank and securities accounts) of Vishay and certain significant domestic subsidiaries, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM7_P190_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the 2010 Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_11_ITEM7_P190_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the 2010 Credit Facility are guaranteed by Vishay.
103730_11_ITEM7_P190_S3	The 2010 Credit Facility also includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on i ts assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments, and requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_11_ITEM7_P191_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.
103730_11_ITEM7_P191_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article 6 of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 1, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P192_S1	Our leverage ratio and interest expense coverage ratio were 0.86 to 1 and 42.51 to 1, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM7_P193_S0	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_11_ITEM7_P193_S1	We also have mechanisms, including deferral of capital expenditures and other discretionary spending, to facilitate on-going compliance.
103730_11_ITEM7_P194_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P194_S1	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_11_ITEM7_P195_S0	During 2010, we made regular principal repayments on our term loan of $12.5 million, and refinanced the remaining $75 million first with our Comerica Facility in connection with the convertible debenture offering and then with the 2010 Credit Facility.
103730_11_ITEM7_P195_S1	We also made other principal payments totaling $17.1 million and transferred approximately $12 million of debt in connection with the spin-off (including approximately $10 million of exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102).
103730_11_ITEM7_P196_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net debt (cash) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P197_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_11_ITEM7_P198_S0	Measurements such as free cash and net debt do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_11_ITEM7_P198_S1	Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_11_ITEM7_P198_S2	However, management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions and repay debt, and that an analysis of net debt assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_11_ITEM7_P198_S3	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_11_ITEM7_P199_S0	Approximately 96% of our December 31, 2010 cash and cash equivalents balance was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM7_P199_S1	At the present time, we expect the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_11_ITEM7_P199_S2	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_11_ITEM7_P200_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2010 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 3.4 to 1, as compared to a ratio of 3.5 to 1 as of December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P200_S1	This decrease is primarily due to an increase in trade accounts payable, payroll related liabilities, and other accrued expenses due to the increase in production volume, resumption of bonus programs, and the discontinuation of short-work and temporary shut-downs, partially offset by an increase in the cash balance at December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P200_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders equity was 0.29 to 1 at December 31, 2010 as compared to a ratio of 0.22 to 1 at December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P200_S3	This decrease is primarily due to an increase in debt due to the convertible senior debenture issuance.
103730_11_ITEM7_P201_S0	Cash flows provided by continuing operating activities were $545.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $290.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P201_S1	This increase is principally due to significantly better operating results in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net working capital during the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P202_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $145.4 million, as compared to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P202_S1	As a result of the economic uncertainty and to preserve cash, we significantly curtailed our capital spending in 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7_P202_S2	The reduced level of capital spending was temporary and not sustainable.
103730_11_ITEM7_P202_S3	We expect capital spending to increase to approximately $150 million in 2011.
103730_11_ITEM7_P203_S0	Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a net cash inflow of $15.0 million, representing the receipt of the term loan extended to KEMET as part of the wet tantalum business acquisition in 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P203_S1	Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a net cash inflow of $28.2 million, representing a partial refund of purchase price, net of related expenses, subsequent to entering a settlement agreement with International Rectifier Corporation.
103730_11_ITEM7_P203_S2	This settlement is more fully described in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P203_S3	Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 included a total $74.2 million paid for the acquisitions of our partner s 51% interest in a transducer manufacturing joint venture, Powertron GmbH, and the KEMET wet tantalum business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P203_S4	Included in the amount is the $15 million loan extended to KEM ET as part of the wet tantalum business acquisition that was subsequently repaid in 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P204_S0	Cash used by discontinued operating activities of $0.1 million and $3.2 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflect payments to settle certain outstanding disputes with the buyer of the ASBU business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P204_S1	The expenses associated with these cash payments were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7_P204_S2	Cash used by discontinued operating activities of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflects receivables collected by Vishay and remitted to the purchaser of the ASBU business pursuant to the transaction agreement.
103730_11_ITEM7_P204_S3	Cash provided by discontinued investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the proceeds of sale of the ASBU business, net of capital spending for information technology systems.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S0	We have had at least $125 million outstanding on our revolving credit facilities since August 2008 when we repurchased our convertible subordinated notes.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S1	The timing of scheduled payments for certain liabilities requires us to draw additional amounts on our credit facility periodically, usually for U.S. cash flow needs.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S2	We historically repaid all amounts drawn in excess of $125 million to meet these short-term financing needs on a quarterly basis and the amounts outstanding on our credit facility can be significantly higher between quarterly reporting periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S3	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we also used our credit facilities to refinance our $75 million term loan balance that would have been due in 2011.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S4	The $240 million that we borrowed on December 1, 2010 under the 2010 Credit Facility to repay the outstanding amounts under the Comerica Facility remains outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S5	For 2010, the average outstanding balance on our credit facilities calculated at fiscal month-ends was $168.0 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P205_S6	For 2010, the highest amount outstanding on our credit facilities at a month end was $240.0 million.
103730_11_ITEM7_P206_S0	Management expects to continue to maintain an outstanding balance of at least $240 million on the 2010 Credit Facility, and to periodically use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs, but expects that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, obligations under restructuring and acquisition integration programs, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_11_ITEM7_P206_S1	Acquisition activity may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_11_ITEM7_P207_S0	As of December 31, 2010 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM7_P208_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_11_ITEM7_P208_S1	Accordingly, the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040 is excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_11_ITEM7_P209_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement, one of which bears a maturity date of 2102, and include commitment fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on December 1, 2015.
103730_11_ITEM7_P209_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040.
103730_11_ITEM7_P210_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_11_ITEM7_P210_S1	Among other things, approximately $370 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock at the option of the holder.
103730_11_ITEM7_P210_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_11_ITEM7_P210_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our variable-rate exchangeable notes due 2102 and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2010, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_11_ITEM7_P211_S0	Letters of credit totaling $8.2 million were originally issued under the Comerica Facility and remain outstanding at December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P211_S1	These letters of credit are used primarily to secure self-insurance programs and will be replaced by letters of credit under the 2010 Credit Facility as they expire in the next year.
103730_11_ITEM7_P212_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 includes approximately $54.3 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_11_ITEM7_P212_S1	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_11_ITEM7_P212_S2	Accordingly, the uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_11_ITEM7_P213_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_11_ITEM7_P213_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_11_ITEM7_P213_S2	See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_11_ITEM7_P213_S3	These obligations were not material to us as of December 31, 2010, and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above.
103730_11_ITEM7_P214_S0	We maintain long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_11_ITEM7_P214_S1	The purchase commitments in the table above include the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these agreements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P214_S2	Our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments.
103730_11_ITEM7_P215_S0	GAAP requires that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market price.
103730_11_ITEM7_P215_S1	The purchase commitments for silicon wafers described above are for the manufacture of proprietary products using Vishay Siliconix-owned technology licensed to this subcontractor by Siliconix, and accordingly, management can only estimate the market price of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments.
103730_11_ITEM7_P215_S2	Management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices.
103730_11_ITEM7_P216_S0	As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, on May 13, 2009, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, our Executive Chairman, Chief Technical and Business Development Office, and founder.
103730_11_ITEM7_P216_S1	Pursuant to the amended and restated employment agreement, Dr. Zandman received $10 million upon signing the agreement and five additional annual payments of $10 million each, one of which was paid in 2010.
103730_11_ITEM7_P217_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, executive employment agreements, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM7_P218_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_11_ITEM7_P219_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_11_ITEM7_P219_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_11_ITEM7_P220_S0	See also Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk for additional related information.
103730_11_ITEM7_P221_S0	As more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, new accounting guidance became effective in 2010 or will become effective in future periods.
103730_11_ITEM7_P222_S0	The adoption of the new guidance described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The exchangeable notes, of which $95 million are outstanding, bear interest at LIBOR (reset quarterly).
103730_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had $240 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2010, we have $897.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, which earns interest at various variable rates.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2010, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $2.1 million.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Also see Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S6	We also have a higher percentage of Euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S7	Therefore, when the Euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is increased.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P9_S8	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $19.9 million and $6.4 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P10_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our f oreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P12_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P14_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P15_S0	We are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P15_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P15_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P15_S3	See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for information on our previous long-term tantalum purchase commitments, which expired in 2006.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P16_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P17_S2	For much of 2008, these metals were trading near all-time record-high prices.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P17_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2008, as metals prices declined significantly from these record-high prices, we entered into commitments to purchase a portion of our estimated 2009 metals needs, principally for copper and palladium.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P17_S4	After entering into these commitments, the market prices for these metals continued to decline.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P17_S5	As a result, we recorded losses on these adverse purchase commitments during the fourth quarter of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM7A_P18_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $12.5 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.

103730_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
103730_11_ITEM15_P63_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_11_ITEM15_P64_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
103730_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	Vishay Intertechnology Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
103730_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_11_ITEM15_P70_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	* May not add due to rounding.
103730_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ( Vishay or the Company ) is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computer, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company s ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_11_ITEM15_P78_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_11_ITEM15_P78_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2010 through the date these financial statements were issued through the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
103730_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company has modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products, which it terms a scrap allowance.
103730_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a stock, ship and debit program whereby it considers requests b y distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_11_ITEM15_P81_S3	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, stock, ship and debit credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	T hese procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $5,781,000, $5,710,000, and $2,996,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $50,968,000, $50,745,000, and $63,161,000, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM15_P87_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	Government grants received by certain subsidiaries, primarily in Israel, are recognized as income in accordance with the purpose of the specific contract and in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
103730_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	Grants recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold were $543,000, $688,000, and $1,386,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM15_P88_S2	Deferred grant income was $2,788,000 and $2,526,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM15_P88_S3	The grants are subject to certain conditions, including maintaining specified levels of employment for periods up to ten years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P88_S4	Noncompliance with such conditions could result in the repayment of grants.
103730_11_ITEM15_P88_S5	However, management expects that the Company will comply with all terms and conditions of the grants.
103730_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of more likely than not.
103730_11_ITEM15_P90_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_11_ITEM15_P90_S4	If the Company s assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_11_ITEM15_P90_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	At the present time, substantially all earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	Highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P92_S2	There were no investments classified as short-term investments at December 31, 2010 or 2009.
103730_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P93_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_11_ITEM15_P94_S1	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_11_ITEM15_P94_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $(838,000), $5,669,000, and $534,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM15_P95_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_11_ITEM15_P95_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P96_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P96_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P96_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P96_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.
103730_11_ITEM15_P96_S4	The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at December 31, 2010 was approximately $32,300,000.
103730_11_ITEM15_P97_S0	Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense.
103730_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	Depreciation expense was $169,724,000, $206,009,000, and $199,847,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
103730_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and admi nistrative expenses).
103730_11_ITEM15_P98_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P99_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_11_ITEM15_P100_S0	Certain of the Company s tradenames have been assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_11_ITEM15_P101_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_11_ITEM15_P101_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P101_S2	Capitalized software is amortized over periods of three to ten years, primarily included in costs of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P101_S3	Customer relationships are amortized over useful lives of five to fifteen years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P101_S4	Noncompete agreements are amortized over periods of five to ten years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P101_S5	The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_11_ITEM15_P102_S1	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_11_ITEM15_P102_S2	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	As more fully described in Note 3, in light of a sustained decline in market capitalization that Vishay and its peer group companies experienced in 2008, and other factors, Vishay determined that an impairment test was necessary as of the end of the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008, and recorded goodwill impairment charges in each of those quarters.
103730_11_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company s required annual impairment test was completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P105_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of September 27, 2008, the last day of the 2008 third fiscal quarter, was effectively the Company s annual impairment test for 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P105_S2	Subsequent to recording the goodwill impairment charges in 2008, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_11_ITEM15_P106_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_11_ITEM15_P107_S0	Also as more fully described in Note 3, prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2008, the Company performed interim impairment tests for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P107_S1	As a result of those assessments, the Company recorded impairment charges during the third fiscal quarter of 2008 related to certain tradenames.
103730_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	The required annual impairment test of tradenames is completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of September 27, 2008, the last day of the 2008 fiscal third quarter, was effectively the Company s annual impairment test for 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P108_S2	There was no impairment identified through the annual impairment tests completed in 2010 or 2009.
103730_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_11_ITEM15_P110_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_11_ITEM15_P110_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_11_ITEM15_P111_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.
103730_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	Other assets include investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_11_ITEM15_P112_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company s non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11) and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company s other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_11_ITEM15_P112_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_11_ITEM15_P112_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity until sold.
103730_11_ITEM15_P112_S4	At the time of sale the assets that are held in trust related to the Company s non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P113_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_11_ITEM15_P113_S2	The convertible senior debentures issued on November 9, 2010 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_11_ITEM15_P113_S3	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_11_ITEM15_P114_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_11_ITEM15_P114_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	The Company has also in the past used financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion, but not all, of its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	The purpose of the Company s foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM15_P118_S2	The Company s operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
103730_11_ITEM15_P119_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P119_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	Compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_11_ITEM15_P123_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	Vishay applies the modified prospective transition method to account for employee stock options granted prior to the adoption of the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 718 on January 1, 2006.
103730_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	Under the modified prospective transition method, the fair value of previously granted but unvested equity awards is recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations from the date of adoption of the guidance, and prior periods are not restated.
103730_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2010 and 2009 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_11_ITEM15_P128_S1	At December 31, 2010, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors and officers insurance.
103730_11_ITEM15_P128_S2	The captive insurance entity had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
103730_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	Restricted cash of $8,987,000 and $6,700,000 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_11_ITEM15_P130_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_11_ITEM15_P130_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_11_ITEM15_P130_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	In January 2010, the FASB staff updated the guidance in ASC Topic 820.
103730_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	The updated guidance (i) requires separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements, (ii) requires disclosure of Level 3 fair value measurements activity on a gross basis, (iii) clarifies existing disaggregation requirements, (iv) and clarifies existing input and valuation technique disclosure requirements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P132_S2	The updated guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the Level 3 fair value measurement disclosure requirements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM15_P132_S3	Vishay adopted the aspects of the guidance that are currently effective as of January 1, 2010 and will adopt the remaining guidance on January 1, 2011.
103730_11_ITEM15_P132_S4	The adoption of the effective guidance had no effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liqu idity and the adoption of the remaining guidance is not expected to have any effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	In February 2010, the FASB staff updated the accounting guidance related to subsequent events.
103730_11_ITEM15_P133_S1	The updated guidance continues to require evaluation of subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued, but removes the requirement to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been issued.
103730_11_ITEM15_P133_S2	Vishay adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM15_P133_S3	The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.

103730_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_11_ITEM15_P141_S1	However, two members of the VPG board of directors also serve on Vishay s board of directors.
103730_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, on July 6, 2010, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	None of the agreements are expected to have a material impact on Vishay s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	Vishay also entered into a trademark license agreement with VPG pursuant to which Vishay granted VPG the license to use certain trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, entity names, and domain names which include the term Vishay.

103730_11_ITEM15_P143_S2	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	As a result of this continuing involvement, Vishay did not restate prior periods to present VPG as a discontinued operation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	The table below summarizes the balance sheet information of VPG as of the date of the spin-off (in thousands) :

103730_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	Under the settlement, International Rectifier refunded $30.0 million of the purchase price associated with the acquisition of the PCS business and Vishay released International Rectifier from claims relating to certain outstanding disputes regarding the acquisition.
103730_11_ITEM15_P147_S2	As all goodwill associated with the PCS business was written off as part of the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, Vishay recorded a gain of $28.2 million during the second quarter of 2009, equal to the amount received pursuant to the settlement agreement less certain related expenses.
103730_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	On April 7, 2008, Vishay sold the automotive modules and subsystems business unit ( ASBU ) to a private equity firm.
103730_11_ITEM15_P148_S1	ASBU was originally acquired by Vishay as part of the April 1, 2007 acquisition of International Rectifier s Power Control Systems business ( PCS business ).
103730_11_ITEM15_P148_S2	Vishay determined that ASBU would not satisfactorily complement Vishay s operations.

103730_11_ITEM15_P155_S2	After the realignment of the Company s segments (see Note 15), this business is reported in the VPG segment.
103730_11_ITEM15_P156_S0	The cost to acquire the partner s 51% interest was allocated on a pro rata basis to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values, with the excess being allocated to goodwill.

103730_11_ITEM15_P162_S1	In addition, Vishay filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware naming as defendants International Rectifier and its eight directors.
103730_11_ITEM15_P163_S0	On October 10, 2008, International Rectifier held its delayed 2007 annual meeting of stockholders.

103730_11_ITEM15_P164_S0	Vishay incurred $4 million of costs associated with the International Rectifier tender offer, which are presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P165_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_11_ITEM15_P165_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_11_ITEM15_P165_S2	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_11_ITEM15_P166_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_11_ITEM15_P166_S1	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares the fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_11_ITEM15_P166_S2	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_11_ITEM15_P166_S3	The comparable companies utilized in the evaluation are generally the members of the Company s peer group included in the presentation of the stock performance graph in Item 5 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
103730_11_ITEM15_P167_S0	In step two, the Company determines the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if Vishay had acquired those business units on the measurement date.
103730_11_ITEM15_P167_S1	Specifically, the Company must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
103730_11_ITEM15_P167_S2	The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two.
103730_11_ITEM15_P168_S0	Fair value of reporting units, and the underlying assets and liabilities of those reporting units, is measured at a point in time, and reflects specific market conditions as of the measurement date.
103730_11_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Company performed its annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_11_ITEM15_P169_S1	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization that Vishay and its peer group companies experienced in each successive quarter of 2008, and other factors, the Company determined that impairment tests were necessary as of the end of the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008, and recorded goodwill impairment charges in each of those quarters.
103730_11_ITEM15_P169_S2	The interim test performed as of the last day of the third fiscal quarter of 2008, was effectively the Company s annual impairment test for 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P169_S3	Subsequent to recording these impairment charges, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_11_ITEM15_P169_S4	In total, Vishay recorded goodwill impairment charges aggregating $1,696.2 million in year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires Vishay to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P170_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industry in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_11_ITEM15_P172_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	The goodwill impairment charge is noncash in nature and did not affect the Company s liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P174_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment during the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008, the Company performed a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P174_S1	As a result of those assessments, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $27 million during the third fiscal quarter of 2008 related to indefinite-lived intangible assets (certain tradenames).
103730_11_ITEM15_P174_S2	The fair value of the tradenames was measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_11_ITEM15_P175_S0	The remaining balances of the tradenames acquired in the previous transactions, aggregating approximately $35.4 million as of the date of recording the impairment charge, were reclassified to definite-lived intangible assets concurrent with the recording of the impairment charge.
103730_11_ITEM15_P175_S1	The Company then began amortizing the remaining balances of these tradenames over a ten-year life.
103730_11_ITEM15_P175_S2	The Company expects to continue to use such tradenames.
103730_11_ITEM15_P175_S3	However, the identified impairment and expected future cash flows associated with the tradenames reflect the existence of competitive, economic, and other factors that will limit the useful life of these tradenames.
103730_11_ITEM15_P176_S0	The indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment charge was noncash in nature and did not affect Vishay s liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P177_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	Approximately $15.4 million of net intangible assets were transferred to VPG on July 6, 2010.

103730_11_ITEM15_P178_S2	VPG accounted for $1,466,000, $3,019,000, and $2,441,000 of amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

103730_11_ITEM15_P180_S3	Severance costs also include executive severance and charges for the fair value of stock options of certain former employees which were modified such that they did not expire at termination.
103730_11_ITEM15_P180_S4	Restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which the Company determines it will incur those costs and all requirements of accrual are met.
103730_11_ITEM15_P180_S5	Because these costs are recorded based upon estimates, actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs.
103730_11_ITEM15_P180_S6	If the initial estimates are too low or too high, the Company could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse part of the previously recorded charges.
103730_11_ITEM15_P181_S0	Asset write-downs are principally related to buildings and equipment that will not be used subsequent to the completion of restructuring plans, and cannot be sold for amounts in excess of carrying value.
103730_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company did not initiate any new restructuring projects in the year ended December 31, 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance costs expenses in the year.

103730_11_ITEM15_P183_S4	The restructuring and severance costs were incurred primarily in response to the declining business conditions experienced in the second half of 2008 and recessionary trends which continued into 2009.
103730_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following table summarizes activity to date related to restructuring programs initiated in 2009 (in thousands, except for number of employees):
103730_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	Most of the accrued restructuring liability, currently shown in other accrued expenses, is expected to be paid by December 31, 2011.
103730_11_ITEM15_P185_S1	The payment terms related to these restructuring programs varies, usually based on local customs and laws.
103730_11_ITEM15_P185_S2	Most severance amounts are paid in a lump sum at termination, while some payments are structured to be paid in installments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company recorded restructuring and severance costs of $62,537,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	Employee termination costs were $58,601,000, covering technical, production, administrative, and support employees located in nearly every country in which the Company operates.
103730_11_ITEM15_P186_S2	Through the first nine months of 2008, these restructuring activities were part of the Company s on-going cost reduction initiatives.
103730_11_ITEM15_P186_S3	The significant increase in restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of 2008 was substantially attributable to the declining business conditions experienced in the second half of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P186_S4	Severance costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 also include executive severance (see Note 13) and a pension settlement charge of $2,894,000 related to employees in the Republic of China (Taiwan) (see Note 11).

103730_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	Approximately $150,548,000 of the carryforwards in Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands resulted from the Company s acquisition of BCcomponents in 2002.
103730_11_ITEM15_P195_S1	Valuation allowances of $44,790,000 and $49,043,000, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have been recorded through goodwill for these acquired net operating losses.
103730_11_ITEM15_P195_S2	Prior to the adoption of updated guidance in ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009, if tax benefits were recognized through the utilization of these acquired net operating losses, the benefits of such loss utilization were recorded as a reduction to goodwill.
103730_11_ITEM15_P195_S3	After the adoption of the updated guidance on January 1, 2009, the benefits of such losses are recorded as a reduction of tax expense.
103730_11_ITEM15_P195_S4	In 2010 and 2009, the tax benefit recognized through a reduction of acquisition-date valuation allowances recorded as a reduction of tax expense was $567,000 and $980,000, respectively.

103730_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	In connection with the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes on August 1, 2008 (see Note 6), the Company repatriated approximately $250 million of cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P199_S1	This repatriation of cash resulted in net tax expense of approximately $9.9 million, recorded in the second quarter of 2008, after the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits as a result of this repatriation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P199_S2	The Company expected that it would need to repatriate additional cash to repay an outstanding term loan, and recorded additional tax expense on the expected repatriation of $112.5 million because such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
103730_11_ITEM15_P199_S3	At the present time, the Company expects that the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.
103730_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	Net income taxes paid (refunded) were $23,322,000, ($4,714,000), and $72,116,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

103730_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
103730_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_11_ITEM15_P202_S2	These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_11_ITEM15_P202_S3	We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_11_ITEM15_P203_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_11_ITEM15_P203_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_11_ITEM15_P203_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	Until the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, VPG was included in the Company s consolidated federal income tax returns and will be included with the Company and/or certain of the Company s subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.

103730_11_ITEM15_P227_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes are deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_11_ITEM15_P228_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spinoff, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,041,540 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM15_P228_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM15_P229_S0	The notes are subject to a put and call agreement under which the holders may at any time put the notes to Vishay in exchange for 6,176,471 shares of Vishay s common stock in the aggregate, and Vishay may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.

103730_11_ITEM15_P251_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_11_ITEM15_P252_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_11_ITEM15_P252_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_11_ITEM15_P253_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P254_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_11_ITEM15_P255_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_11_ITEM15_P255_S1	These include pension plans which are qualified under Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) and the Internal Revenue Code, and non-qualified pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_11_ITEM15_P255_S2	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_11_ITEM15_P256_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans include both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_11_ITEM15_P256_S1	The Company s principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_11_ITEM15_P256_S2	The Company s other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P257_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_11_ITEM15_P257_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P257_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P257_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_11_ITEM15_P258_S0	The Company s other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P259_S0	The Company s principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_11_ITEM15_P259_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_11_ITEM15_P260_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_11_ITEM15_P260_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a rabbi trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_11_ITEM15_P260_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_11_ITEM15_P260_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P260_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were approximately $15 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
103730_11_ITEM15_P260_S5	Effective July 6, 2010, $1.3 million of these assets were transferred to VPG equal to the non-qualified pension liabilities of employees of VPG, which were retained by VPG.
103730_11_ITEM15_P261_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_11_ITEM15_P261_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P261_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P261_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_11_ITEM15_P262_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_11_ITEM15_P262_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_11_ITEM15_P263_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_11_ITEM15_P263_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company will provide an annual retirement benefit equal to 50% of his average base pay and bonus for the five years preceding his retirement (but not to exceed $1 million annually).
103730_11_ITEM15_P263_S2	These pension benefits are unfunded and fully vested.
103730_11_ITEM15_P264_S0	On June 16, 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul s and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman s employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_11_ITEM15_P264_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM15_P264_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_11_ITEM15_P265_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_11_ITEM15_P265_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.

103730_11_ITEM15_P272_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2011 is $11.9 million.
103730_11_ITEM15_P273_S0	The net curtailment and settlement losses for 2009 are primarily related to the Company s restructuring plans in the Philippines and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_11_ITEM15_P273_S1	The settlement losses for 2008 are primarily related to the Company s restructuring plans in the Republic of China (Taiwan).

103730_11_ITEM15_P275_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
103730_11_ITEM15_P276_S0	The plans expected return on assets is based on management s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_11_ITEM15_P276_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P277_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S0	The Company s U.S. defined benefit plans are invested in diversified portfolios of public-market equity and fixed income securities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S1	Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and, in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S2	The target allocation has historically been approximately 60% invested in equity securities and 40% invested in fixed income securities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S3	The Company s non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S4	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S5	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P278_S6	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P279_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P280_S0	The Company anticipates making contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans of between $12 million and $16 million in 2011.
103730_11_ITEM15_P281_S0	The Company s anticipated 2011 contributions for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans will approximate the expected benefit payments disclosed above.
103730_11_ITEM15_P282_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_11_ITEM15_P282_S1	One of these plans was amended effective January 1, 2009, which reduced the benefit obligations of the Company.
103730_11_ITEM15_P282_S2	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P283_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into formal employment agreements with six of its executives.
103730_11_ITEM15_P283_S1	These employment agreements provide medical benefits for these executives and their surviving spouses for life, up to a $15,000 annual premium value per person.

103730_11_ITEM15_P349_S4	In 2010, Siliconix amended its agreement with Tower to extend through the second quarter of 2015.
103730_11_ITEM15_P350_S0	Management estimates its purchase commitments under the 2008 Tower agreement as follows (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P351_S0	Siliconix has granted Tower an option to produce additional wafers under this agreement, as needed by Siliconix, and accordingly, actual purchases from Tower may be different than the commitments disclosed above.
103730_11_ITEM15_P351_S1	Actual purchases from Tower during the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $41.8 million.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of the Company s products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S2	For much of 2008, these metals were trading near all-time record-high prices.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2008, as metals prices declined significantly from these record-high prices, the Company entered into commitments to purchase a portion of its estimated 2009 metals needs, principally for copper and palladium.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S4	After entering into these commitments, the market prices for these metals continued to decline.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S5	As a result, the Company recorded losses on these adverse purchase commitments during the fourth quarter of 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P352_S6	These losses, which aggregate to $6,024,000, are recorded on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated sta tement of operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P353_S0	The Company has various other purchase commitments incidental to the ordinary conduct of business.
103730_11_ITEM15_P353_S1	Such commitments are at prices which are not in excess of current market prices.
103730_11_ITEM15_P354_S0	The Company is a party to various product quality claims in the normal course of business.
103730_11_ITEM15_P354_S1	The Company provides warranties for its products which offer replacement of defective products.
103730_11_ITEM15_P354_S2	Annual warranty expenses are generally not significant.
103730_11_ITEM15_P355_S0	The Company periodically receives claims which arise from consequential damages which result from a customer s installation of an alleged defective Vishay component into the customer s product.
103730_11_ITEM15_P355_S1	Although not covered by its stated warranty, Vishay may occasionally reimburse the customer for these consequential damages in limited circumstances.
103730_11_ITEM15_P356_S0	The Company has employment agreements with certain of its senior executives.
103730_11_ITEM15_P356_S1	These employment agreements provide incremental compensation in the event of termination.
103730_11_ITEM15_P356_S2	The Company does not provide any severance or other benefits specifically upon a change in control.
103730_11_ITEM15_P357_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Board of Directors was notified that Richard N. Grubb, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, would be stepping down for good reason (as defined in his employment agreement), in connection with a change in the corporate finance and accounting function of the Company.
103730_11_ITEM15_P357_S1	The Company recorded severance charges associated with Mr. Grubb s termination during 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P357_S2	These costs are reported in restructuring and severance costs on the consolidated statement of operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P358_S0	On May 13, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman (the 2009 Agreement ).
103730_11_ITEM15_P358_S1	This agreement amends and restates the existing employment agreement between the Company and Dr. Zandman that was previously amended and restated as of January 1, 2004 (the 2004 Agreement ).
103730_11_ITEM15_P359_S0	The purpose of the 2009 Agreement was to eliminate the right of Dr. Zandman to receive a royalty during the ten years following his termination of employment equal to 5% of gross sales, less returns and allowances, of Vishay products incorporating inventions and any other form of technology created, discovered or developed by him or under his direction.
103730_11_ITEM15_P359_S1	The royalty was payable in the event Dr. Zandman was terminated without cause or resigned for good reason, as defined in the 2004 Agreement.
103730_11_ITEM15_P359_S2	This provision was carried over from Dr. Zandman s original employment agreement of March 1985, and could not be modified or eliminated without Dr. Zandman s consent.
103730_11_ITEM15_P359_S3	It was a reflection, among other things, of Dr. Zandman s key role in the founding of the Company and in creating, developing and commercializing the Company s technologies and the absence of any compensation to Dr. Zandman for the co re intellectual property that he has contributed to the Company over the years from its inception.
103730_11_ITEM15_P360_S0	The Company engaged a consultant in 2007 to assist its evaluation of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment to be terminated.
103730_11_ITEM15_P360_S1	Based in part upon the work of this consultant and management s own updated computations, management estimated that the present value of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment terminated at December 31, 2008 would be between approximately $370 million and $445 million, with a possible tax gross-up if the royalties were payable in connection with a change of control and deemed subject to an excise tax.
103730_11_ITEM15_P361_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Dr. Zandman s right to the royalty payments has been terminated.
103730_11_ITEM15_P361_S1	Dr. Zandman received a payment of $10 million as of the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, and is entitled to receive five additional annual payments of $10 million each.
103730_11_ITEM15_P361_S2	The Company recognized compensation expense of $57.8 million during the second quarter of 2009, representing the present value of these payments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P361_S3	This amount is presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_11_ITEM15_P361_S4	The Company recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge.
103730_11_ITEM15_P361_S5	At December 31, 2010, the Company had $28.9 million and $10.0 million accrued in other liabilities and other accrued expenses, respectively, for this liability.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S0	Payments pursuant to the 2009 Agreement may be deferred with interest in the event that making such payment would jeopardize the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S1	Payments will accelerate if, following a change of control of the Company, Dr. Zandman is terminated without cause or if he terminates employment for good reason.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S2	In the event of Dr. Zandman s death or disability, the unpaid annual installments would accelerate upon a change of control, whether it occurs before or after the death or disability.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S3	If an excise tax were imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code due to the acceleration of the payments, the Company will reimburse Dr. Zandman for the excise tax on customary terms.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S4	Absent a change of control, if the Company were to terminate Dr. Zandman s employment without cause or Dr. Zandman were to terminate employment for good reason or in the event of his death or disability, the un paid annual installment payments would not accelerate and would continue until completed.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S5	Dr. Zandman will forfeit future payments if he terminates his employment without good reason or if his employment is terminated for cause.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S6	Furthermore, as a result of the 2009 Agreement, Dr. Zandman will not receive any other severance payments upon his termination of employment for any reason.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S7	Other terms of the 2004 Agreement remain substantially the same.
103730_11_ITEM15_P362_S8	Dr. Zandman continues to be subject to non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality covenants.
103730_11_ITEM15_P363_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of net revenues, a material portion of the Company s revenues are derived from the worldwide communications and computer markets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P363_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_11_ITEM15_P363_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company s products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial position.
103730_11_ITEM15_P364_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_11_ITEM15_P365_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P365_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company s large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P365_S2	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
103730_11_ITEM15_P366_S0	Many of the Company s products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_11_ITEM15_P366_S1	The Company s consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_11_ITEM15_P366_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company s customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_11_ITEM15_P366_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, coul d have a material adverse effect on the Company s net earnings.
103730_11_ITEM15_P367_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_11_ITEM15_P367_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company s ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_11_ITEM15_P367_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company s ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company s products.
103730_11_ITEM15_P368_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum.
103730_11_ITEM15_P369_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_11_ITEM15_P369_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_11_ITEM15_P370_S0	The Company was obligated under two contracts entered into in 2000 with Cabot Corporation to make purchases of tantalum through 2006.
103730_11_ITEM15_P370_S1	The Company s purchase commitments were entered into at a time when market demand for tantalum capacitors was high and tantalum powder was in short supply.
103730_11_ITEM15_P370_S2	Since that time, the price of tantalum has decreased significantly, and accordingly, the Company wrote down the carrying value of its tantalum inventory on-hand and recognized losses on purchase commitments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P370_S3	As of December 31, 2006, the Company has fulfilled all obligations under the Cabot contracts and is no longer required to purchase tantalum from Cabot at prices fixed by the contracts.
103730_11_ITEM15_P371_S0	Our minimum tantalum purchase commitments under the contracts with Cabot exceeded our production requirements for tantalum capacitors over the term of the contract.
103730_11_ITEM15_P372_S0	Tantalum powder and wire have an indefinite shelf life; therefore, we believe that we will eventually use all of the material in our inventory.
103730_11_ITEM15_P372_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had tantalum with a book value of $0 and $13,032,000, respectively, classified as other assets, representing the value of quantities which were not expected to be used within one year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P373_S0	We have operations outside the United States, and, excluding VPG, approximately 77% of our revenues during 2010 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_11_ITEM15_P373_S1	Some of our products are produced in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_11_ITEM15_P373_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_11_ITEM15_P373_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results.
103730_11_ITEM15_P374_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 40 years.
103730_11_ITEM15_P374_S1	We have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_11_ITEM15_P374_S2	However, we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_11_ITEM15_P375_S0	In preparation for the spin-off of VPG, which was completed on July 6, 2010, the Company realigned its reportable business segments structure in the second fiscal quarter of 2010 to be consistent with changes made to its management reporting.
103730_11_ITEM15_P375_S1	The changes made to management reporting included separating the former Semiconductors reporting segment into MOSFETs, Diodes, and Optoelectronic Components and separating the former Passive components reporting segment into Resistors and Inductors, Capacitors, and Vishay Precision Group ( VPG ).
103730_11_ITEM15_P375_S2	The changes were necessary due to the former Passive components segment no longer being comparable after the completion of the spin-off of VPG, the need for discrete information regarding VPG, and the increased interest of management and outside investors in more discrete financial information.
103730_11_ITEM15_P375_S3	Effective beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2010, the chief operating decision maker began ma king strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on this new segment structure.
103730_11_ITEM15_P376_S0	Following the completion of the spin-off in the third fiscal quarter, the Company has five reporting segments.
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ( segment operating income ).
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S1	Beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2010, the Company changed its definition of segment operating income to exclude such costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups.
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S2	These costs are managed by executives that report to the chief operating decision maker and were formerly included in segment operating income.
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S3	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S4	Additionally, management has always evaluated segment performance excluding items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gains or losses on purchase commitments, and other items.
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S5	Ma nagement believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_11_ITEM15_P377_S6	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_11_ITEM15_P378_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_11_ITEM15_P379_S0	The Company has also disclosed certain additional items not used to evaluate segment performance.
103730_11_ITEM15_P379_S1	In some cases, the items are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are required to be disclosed by GAAP.
103730_11_ITEM15_P379_S2	Additionally, the additional segment disclosures may provide insight to the Company s future profitability by reportable segment.
103730_11_ITEM15_P380_S0	Results for years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 have been adjusted to reflect the new reporting segment structure.
103730_11_ITEM15_P380_S1	The following tables set forth business segment information (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P381_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows are included in the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_11_ITEM15_P381_S1	Excluding the non-recurring costs of the spin-off incurred by Vishay, VPG contributed $9,716,000 of income before taxes, $5,811,000 of net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders, and $0.03 per diluted share attributable to Vishay stockholders to Vishay s 2010 results.
103730_11_ITEM15_P382_S0	The following geographic data include net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within that geographic area and property and equipment based on physical location (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P383_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_11_ITEM15_P383_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), warrants (see Note 7), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P384_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (in thousands, except per share) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P385_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_11_ITEM15_P386_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_11_ITEM15_P387_S0	The Company s convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_11_ITEM15_P387_S1	While none of these events has occurred as of December 31, 2010, certain conditions which could trigger conversion have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_11_ITEM15_P388_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_11_ITEM15_P388_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method (similar to options and warrants) rather than the if converted method otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_11_ITEM15_P388_S2	Under the treasury stock method, Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the notes based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_11_ITEM15_P388_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.88, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P389_S0	As described in Note 6, the Company purchased 99.6% of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes due 2023 pursuant to the option of the holders to require the Company to repurchase their notes on August 1, 2008.
103730_11_ITEM15_P389_S1	The remaining notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $1,870,000, were redeemed at Vishay s option on August 1, 2010.
103730_11_ITEM15_P390_S0	The Company waived its rights to settle the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes, due 2023, in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_11_ITEM15_P390_S1	Accordingly, the notes were included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method (similar to options and warrants) rather than the if converted method otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_11_ITEM15_P390_S2	If the average market price was less than $21.28, no shares were included in the diluted earnings per share computation.
103730_11_ITEM15_P390_S3	The convertible subordinated notes were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 and therefore are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
103730_11_ITEM15_P391_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following (in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM15_P392_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_11_ITEM15_P392_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_11_ITEM15_P392_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_11_ITEM15_P393_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_11_ITEM15_P394_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_11_ITEM15_P394_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_11_ITEM15_P395_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions.
103730_11_ITEM15_P396_S0	An asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_11_ITEM15_P397_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
103730_11_ITEM15_P398_S0	The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as rabbi trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans.
103730_11_ITEM15_P398_S1	Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale and company-owned life insurance assets.
103730_11_ITEM15_P398_S2	The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P398_S3	The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company s insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts.
103730_11_ITEM15_P398_S4	The fair value measurement of the marketable securities held in the rabbi trust is considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_11_ITEM15_P398_S5	Effective July 6, 2010, $3,701,000 of these assets were transferred to VPG equal to the deferred c ompensation and non-qualified pension liabilities of employees of VPG, which were retained by VPG.
103730_11_ITEM15_P399_S0	The Company maintains defined benefit retirement plans in certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_11_ITEM15_P399_S1	The assets of the plans are measured at fair value.
103730_11_ITEM15_P400_S0	Equity securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of various mutual funds and exchange traded funds that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P400_S1	The fair value measurement of the mutual funds and exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_11_ITEM15_P401_S0	Fixed income securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of exchange traded funds, investments in a group annuity contract, and a short-term investment fund.
103730_11_ITEM15_P401_S1	The exchange traded funds are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_11_ITEM15_P401_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_11_ITEM15_P402_S0	The group annuity contract consists of a general asset account and a pooled separate account.

103730_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of our measurements and foil resistor businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ( Vishay Precision Group or VPG ) through a tax- free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	In the 1950 s, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay s founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with the financial help of the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	Throughout the 1960 s and 1970 s, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	These products became part of Vishay Precision Group, which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	In the early 1990 s, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay s global market position in passive components.
103730_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; and the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011.
103730_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	On January 13, 2012, we acquired HiRel Systems, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	In the late 1990 s, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Vishay s next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay s acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	We also acquired several businesses as part of our Measurements Group s strategy of vertical market integration.
103730_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	The measurements business became part of VPG, which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	On June 4, 2011, Dr. Felix Zandman passed away.
103730_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Dr. Zandman will never be forgotten as his legacy will live on across the world through all Vishay employees.
103730_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	We will continue to implement the vision, strategy, and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman as we continue to work tirelessly to enhance value for our stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	In accordance with our succession plan, Marc Zandman was elected as Executive Chairman of the Board.
103730_12_ITEM1_P11_S4	Marc Zandman also succeeded Dr. Zandman as our Chief Business Development Officer.
103730_12_ITEM1_P11_S5	Dr. Gerald Paul continues to lead Vishay as our President and Chief Executive Officer.
103730_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Vishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2143.
103730_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our telephone number is (610) 644-1300.
103730_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We were founded based on the inventions of Dr. Felix Zandman and we continue to emphasize technological innovation as a driver of growth.
103730_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	We are currently a worldwide technology and market leader in wirewound and other power resistors, leaded film resistors, thin film SMD resistors, wet and conformal-coated tantalum capacitors, capacitors for power electronics, power rectifiers, low-voltage power MOSFETs, and infrared components.
103730_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We maintain strategically placed application and product support centers where proximity to customers and our manufacturing locations enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	The breadth of our product portfolio along with the proximity of our field application engineers to customers provides increased opportunities to have our components selected and designed into new end products by customers in all relevant market segments.
103730_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	We have implemented a plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through accelerating the development of new products and technologies and increasing design-in opportunities by expanding our technical resources for providing solutions to customers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We are a leading manufacturer in our industry, with a broad product portfolio, access to a wide range of end markets and sales channels, and geographic diversity.
103730_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have solid, well-established relationships with our customers and strong distribution channels.
103730_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our senior management team is highly experienced, with deep industry knowledge.
103730_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	Over the past two decades, our management team has successfully restructured our company and integrated several acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	We can adapt our operations to changing economic conditions, as demonstrated by the significant, rapid cost-cutting initiatives in response to the global economic recession of 2008-2009, our ability to significantly reduce working capital investment and continue to generate cash during the recession, and our ability to capitalize on improving market conditions following the global economic recession of 2008-2009.
103730_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have the broadest product line of discrete semiconductors and passive components among our competitors.
103730_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our broad product portfolio allows us to penetrate markets in all industry segments and all regions, which reduces our exposure to a particular end market or geographic location.
103730_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	In 2011, we implemented a plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through improving market penetration by expanding manufacturing facilities for our most successful products and developing markets for specialty products in Asia.
103730_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our net revenues, excluding VPG, for the following applicable periods were attributable to customers in the following regions:
103730_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The share of net revenues, excluding VPG, by end market was as follows:
103730_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Since 1985, we have expanded our product line through various strategic acquisitions, growing from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world s largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.
103730_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We have successfully integrated the acquired companies within our existing management and operational structure, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales and administrative functions, creating manufacturing synergies, while improving customer service.
103730_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	In 2011, we implemented a plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	We often target high margin niche business acquisitions, such as Huntington Electric and HiRel Systems, which we acquired in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as free cash.
103730_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive free cash in each of the past 15 years and free cash in excess of $80 million in each of the past 10 years.
103730_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures in prior periods and continued cost control activities (see Cost Management included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ) will continue our strong free cash generation going forward.
103730_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2011, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $599 million.
103730_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $450 million through December 1, 2015, of which $287 million was available as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong free cash flow generation provides financial strength and flexibility and reduces our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and in the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A.
103730_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	We expect to continue to use our research and development ( R D ), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our success.
103730_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop new innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products to make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends.
103730_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Over the past several years we implemented programs to optimize our labor distribution across the globe.
103730_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	After successfully realigning our labor distribution, our focus is directed to controlling fixed costs and reducing variable costs.
103730_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	We expect to continue to expand within the electronic components industry, through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product innovation, quality, and reliability, strong customer bases, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We maintain significant production facilities in those regions where we market the bulk of our products in order to enhance the service and responsiveness that we provide to our customers.

103730_12_ITEM1_P48_S4	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P48_S5	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current.
103730_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	They vary widely in precision and cost, and are manufactured from numerous materials and in many forms.
103730_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Linear resistive components are classified as variable or fixed, depending on whether or not their resistance is adjustable.
103730_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Non-linear resistors function by varying in resistance under influence of temperature (thermistors) or voltage (varistors).
103730_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	They can be used in temperature-measuring applications or as current or voltage-limiting devices.
103730_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	We manufacture virtually all types of fixed resistors, both in discrete and network forms, as well as many variable types.
103730_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Vishay resistor innovations include Power Metal Strip technology.
103730_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	These resistors feature very low resistance and are used to measure changes in current flow (current sensing) or divert current flow (shunting).
103730_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Inductors use an internal magnetic field to change AC current phase and resist AC current.
103730_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Inductor applications include controlling AC current and voltage, filtering out unwanted electrical signals, and energy storage.
103730_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Vishay inductor innovations include IHLP low-profile, high-current inductor technology with industry-leading specifications, which is patented and generates royalty revenue.
103730_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	Our low-profile, high-current inductors save circuit board space and power in voltage regulator module ( VRM ) and DC to DC converter applications.
103730_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	In addition, we are a worldwide leader in custom magnetic solutions focusing on high performance and high reliability.
103730_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our Capacitors business consists of a broad range of reliable, high-quality products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	We have a strong presence worldwide in specialty markets based on our product performance and reliability and strong brand recognition (Sprague, Vitramon, Roederstein, BCcomponents, and ESTA).
103730_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P55_S3	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Capacitors are used in almost all electronic circuits.
103730_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	They store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Important applications for capacitors include electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies; decoupling and bypass of electronic signals for integrated circuits and circuit boards; and frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applications.
103730_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	We manufacture products based on all major capacitor technologies: tantalum (molded chip tantalum, coated chip tantalum, solid through-hole tantalum, and wet tantalum), ceramic (multilayer chip and ceramic disc), film, power, heavy-current, and aluminum electrolytic.
103730_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our capacitors range from tiny surface-mount devices for hearing aids and mobile devices to large power correction capacitors used in renewable energy, heavy industry, and electrical power grids.
103730_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	We are a recognized technology leader in many product ranges, securing our strong position in military and medical markets, and in a wide range of industrial and automotive applications.
103730_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our wet tantalum and MicroTan technologies are market leaders.
103730_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by United States government agencies, and under certain European military specifications.
103730_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_12_ITEM1_P59_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product s classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People s Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed dies or chips ) on each wafer.
103730_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed packages ) that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People s Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel (see Israeli Government Incentives below).
103730_12_ITEM1_P64_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	The recently acquired HiRel Systems manufacturing facilities are located in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Dominican Republic, and the People s Republic of China.
103730_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	The majority of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification and others are actively pursuing such approval.
103730_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	We are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_12_ITEM1_P73_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government s grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	The current benefits derived under these programs are not material to our consolidated results.
103730_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	Because of our significant presence in Israel, the availability of these incentive programs could have a significant positive effect on us if we relocate manufacturing capacity or develop new product lines there.
103730_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	However, there are no substantial plans that would allow us to earn additional benefits.
103730_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	Effective January 2011, the corporate tax rate in Israel decreased.
103730_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	We could be materially adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	However, we have not experienced any material interruption in our Israeli operations during our 41 years of operations there, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	If demand falls below customers forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ), electronic manufacturing services ( EMS ) companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2011 is shown below:
103730_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_12_ITEM1_P84_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating pricing and contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_12_ITEM1_P85_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer s business requirements.
103730_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ( FAEs ) to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers engineering needs.
103730_12_ITEM1_P87_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computing, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_12_ITEM1_P87_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay design-in the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_12_ITEM1_P87_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_12_ITEM1_P87_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P88_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_12_ITEM1_P88_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:

103730_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity s or individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_12_ITEM1_P106_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_12_ITEM1_P106_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) at Superfund sites.
103730_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_12_ITEM1_P110_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_12_ITEM1_P110_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_12_ITEM1_P110_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_12_ITEM1_P110_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_12_ITEM1_P111_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1_P111_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_12_ITEM1_P111_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_12_ITEM1_P111_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 20,900 full time employees, of whom approximately 89% were located outside the United States.
103730_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	The recent acquisition of HiRel Systems adds approximately 1,000 full time employees, of whom approximately 75% are located outside of the United States.
103730_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_12_ITEM1_P114_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_12_ITEM1_P115_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_12_ITEM1_P115_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_12_ITEM1_P115_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_12_ITEM1_P115_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_12_ITEM1_P116_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_12_ITEM1_P116_S3	To view the reports, access ir.vishay.com and click on SEC Filings.
103730_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	To view these documents, access ir.vishay.com and click on Corporate Governance.
103730_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and the periods of decline we experienced in the recent past may resume and may become more pronounced.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	A decline in product demand on a global basis could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we also attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite the plan we adopted in 2011 to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investment balances will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $399 million as of December 31, 2011, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion at our facilities.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide sufficient, or may alter existing, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P28_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the global economic recession.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P40_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 78% of our revenues during 2011 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 41 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We obtain substantial benefits by operating in Israel, but these benefits may not continue.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government s grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	There can also be no assurance that in the future the Israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that, if it does, such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to benefit from them.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Any significant increase in the Israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the Israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People s Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Because we believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, we do not anticipate transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P60_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Approximately 88% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2011, $875.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	At the present time, we expect the cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P65_S2	At December 31,2011, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 48.3% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P65_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 81.9% of our Class B common stock, representing 39.7% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	As a result of the passing of our founder and Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 81.9% of our Class B common stock, representing 39.7% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Such holders may exert considerable influence over the Company s policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P69_S4	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If the VPG spin-off transaction is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax could incur substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The VPG spin-off transaction was conditioned upon Vishay s receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) and an opinion of tax counsel (the Opinion ) confirming that the VPG spin-off transaction should qualify as tax-free to us and our stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, and representations from us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies businesses and other matters.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Any inaccuracy in these facts, assumptions, or representations could invalidate the ruling, and we and our stockholders could be subject to substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and Opinion, the IRS or state or local tax authorities (collectively with the IRS, the Tax Authorities ) could determine on audit that the VPG spin-off transaction should be treated as a taxable transaction if the Tax Authorities determine that any of these facts, assumptions, or representations are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of our company or VPG after the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Under the tax matters agreement between our company and VPG, VPG generally would be required to indemnify our company against its taxes resulting from the failure of the VPG spin-off transaction to qualify as tax-free ( Transaction Taxes ) as a result of (i) any action by VPG or any of its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would reasonably be expected to prevent the spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction to us and our stockholders (ii) any action by VPG or its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would be inconsistent with any material information or representation made in connection with the private letter ruling obtained by us from the IRS and/or with the Opinion or (iii) certain other actions taken by VPG.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	However, in the event that Transaction Taxes are incurred for any other reason, we would not be entitled to indemnification.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In addition, due to the potential impact of significant stock ownership changes on the taxability of the spin-off to us, we and VPG may determine not to enter into transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, such as issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs or acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities, if such issuances would exceed certain thresholds and such actions could be considered part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion .
103730_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the Vishay mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, and that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2011, our business had 45 manufacturing locations.
103730_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.
103730_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some locations include both owned and leased facilities in the same location.
103730_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The list of manufacturing facilities below excludes manufacturing facilities that are presently idle due to our restructuring activities.
103730_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our restructuring efforts, as well as additional information in Cost Management included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
103730_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment generally are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs.
103730_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
103730_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	The principal locations of our owned manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	The principal locations of our leased manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM2_P4_S0	The recently acquired HiRel Systems manufacturing facilities include one owned facility in the United States, two leased facilities in the United States, one leased facility in the Dominican Republic, and one leased facility in the People s Republic of China.
103730_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
103730_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	During the past few years, we settled several suits which we had initiated to enforce our intellectual property rights.
103730_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	We are receiving royalties on sales of these companies products which use our technology.
103730_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	We are continuing to assert our legal rights against other parties which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights.
103730_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	In January 2005, an amended class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California on behalf of all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix against Vishay, Ernst Young LLP (the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company s financial statements), Dr. Felix Zandman, former Executive Chairman and Chief Technical and Business Development Officer of Vishay, and as a nominal defendant, Siliconix.
103730_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	The suit made various claims against Vishay and the other defendants for actions allegedly taken in respect of Siliconix during the period when Vishay owned an 80.4% interest in Siliconix.
103730_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	The action, which we refer to as the Proctor litigation on account of the lead plaintiff, sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
103730_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	In May 2005, Vishay successfully completed a tender offer to acquire all shares of Siliconix that were not already owned by Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	Following the announcement of Vishay s intent to make this tender offer, several purported class-action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
103730_12_ITEM3_P4_S2	These actions were consolidated into a single class action and a settlement agreement was reached with the plaintiffs, who effectively represented all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix.
103730_12_ITEM3_P4_S3	The settlement agreement was approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery in October 2005.
103730_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	The plaintiffs in the Proctor litigation filed an amended complaint in the Superior Court of California in November 2005.
103730_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	In June 2006, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a permanent injunction restraining the Proctor plaintiffs from prosecuting the Proctor action.
103730_12_ITEM3_P5_S2	An appeal of the injunction order brought by a former stockholder of Siliconix was dismissed by the Delaware Supreme Court in January 2007.
103730_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	In June 2006, the Proctor litigation was removed from the Superior Court of California to federal District Court.
103730_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	The District Court granted a motion by Ernst Young to dismiss the complaint and a motion by Vishay for summary judgment, effective October 15, 2007.

103730_12_ITEM5_P2_S4	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.
103730_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, the high and low sales prices of our common stock.
103730_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	At February 22, 2012, we had outstanding 12,299,227 shares of Class B common stock, par value $.10 per share, each of which entitles the holder to ten votes.
103730_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Class B common stock generally is not transferable except in certain very limited instances, and there is no market for those shares.
103730_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Class B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock on a share for share basis.

103730_12_ITEM5_P6_S2	Management believes that the product offerings of the companies contained in the peer group are more similar to our product offerings than those of the companies contained in any published industry index.
103730_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	The return of each peer issuer has been weighted according to the respective issuer s stock market capitalization.
103730_12_ITEM5_P7_S1	The line graph assumes that $100 had been invested at December 31, 2006 and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.

103730_12_ITEM6_P6_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as businesses that have been spun off, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, inventory write-downs and write-offs, gains or losses on purchase commitments, contract termination charges, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

103730_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ( VPG ) through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and our Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its results of operations and cash flows are included in the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Prior to the completion of the spin-off of VPG, we operated in six product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, Capacitors, and Vishay Precision Group.

103730_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Dr. Zandman will never be forgotten as his legacy will live on across the world through all Vishay employees.
103730_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	We will continue to implement the vision, strategy, and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman as we continue to work tirelessly to enhance value for our stockholders.

103730_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	Dr. Gerald Paul will continue leading Vishay as our President and Chief Executive Officer.
103730_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through acquisitions and focused research and development.
103730_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world s largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value by repurchasing our stock and improving earnings per share.
103730_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 and second fiscal quarter of 2011, we completed the repurchase of 21.7 million shares of our common stock for $275 million and 8.6 million shares of our common stock for $150 million, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	On September 8, 2011, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that effectively permits us to repurchase up to $300 million of additional shares, conditioned upon maintaining specific pro forma financial ratios and a required minimal amount of available liquidity, as defined in the amendment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	Beginning in 2012, our capacity to repurchase shares of stock will increase each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	We will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We continue to monitor the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1 .
103730_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Despite uncertain short-term global economic conditions, we are confident of the long-term prospects of our business and the electronics industry in general.
103730_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The downturn in demand that much of our industry experienced in the last six fiscal months of 2011 has resulted in a reduction in nearly all key financial metrics compared with the prior year.
103730_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2.594 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.725 billion and $2.042 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $238.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, compared to net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $359.1 million, or $1.89 per share, and a net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders of $57.2 million, or $0.31 per share, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 include a pretax charge of $3.9 million to accelerate the recognition of certain executive compensation upon the passing of Dr. Zandman, a pretax charge of $1.9 million for elements of executive compensation payable upon the resignation of our former Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Lior Yahalomi, $10.0 million of one-time tax expense related to the write-down of deferred tax assets in Israel to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate enacted in January 2011 on certain types of income earned after December 31, 2010, and $6.5 million of one-time tax benefits recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 primarily related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances in various jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The net earnings (loss) attributable to Vishay stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 include various items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliation schedule below.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), including adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share do not have uniform definitions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations.
103730_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 were affected by macroeconomic concerns, which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year.
103730_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	This period of macroeconomic concern followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of 2011 in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession at the same sales volume.
103730_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010 represent a period of favorable business conditions due to increased overall demand for electronic components over the year ended December 31, 2009 and the effects of the cost reductions initiated in the prior years that enabled us to achieve significantly higher earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession, at similar sales volume.
103730_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2009 were substantially impacted by the 2008-2009 global economic recession.
103730_12_ITEM7_P14_S4	Due to our quick reaction to the recession, we mitigated the loss of volume that we experienced through significant reductions of fixed costs and inventories, we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during the recession, and following several quarters of experiencing losses we began to recover from the 2008-2009 global economic recession and produced positive net earnings beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2009.
103730_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices ( ASP ).
103730_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	If demand falls below customers forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	We analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	See Financial Metrics by Segment below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Like many of the companies in our industry, our results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 were impacted by low demand from distributors which led to a reduction of all key financial metrics compared to the prior fiscal quarters.
103730_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The reduction in distributor inventory levels that started in Asia in the third fiscal quarter of 2011 due to reduced consumer product demand spread to distributors in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 despite fairly strong industrial and automotive demand.
103730_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	This reduction in distributor demand has further reduced our backlog and resulted in a decrease in net revenues over the prior year period and the previous fiscal quarters.
103730_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	Typical pricing pressure, particularly for our established semiconductor products, has resulted in a decrease in average selling prices versus the third fiscal quarter of 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Despite the slight decline in average selling prices versus the third fiscal quarter of 2011, average year-to-date selling prices for 2011 remain relatively stable versus the prior year period.
103730_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Lower sales volume and increasing metal prices led to a reduction in gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter versus the prior year period and the previous fiscal quarters.
103730_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Due to the reduction in cancellations and a slight increase in orders, the book-to-bill ratio increased to 0.80 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 from 0.67 in the third fiscal quarter of 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) were 0.77 and 0.83, respectively, versus ratios of 0.55 and 0.82, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ).
103730_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	For these purposes, we will calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay s four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, approximately $100 million of revenues per year over the next five years.
103730_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions larger than $500 million.
103730_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	On September 28, 2011, we acquired the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric, Inc., for approximately $19.3 million.
103730_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The businesses acquired will further enhance our broad resistor portfolio, particularly in the high power and high current ranges, as well as with resistor assemblies for industrial applications.
103730_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for these businesses have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from September 28, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	On January 13, 2012, we acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for approximately $85 million, including repayment of debt, and subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired will further enhance our inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the business will be included in the Resistors Inductors segment beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of our measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Our common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and our Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Upon completion of the spin-off, certain executive officers received bonuses aggregating approximately $2.1 million, which is reflected in the results for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows are included in the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The product lines that comprise VPG are included in the VPG reporting segment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the effect that VPG had on our consolidated results.
103730_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products, particularly our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry and inflation drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Our variable cost reduction efforts include expending capital to increase automation and maximize the efficiency in our production facilities, consolidating materials purchasing across regions and divisions to achieve economies of scale, materials substitution, maintaining an appropriate mix of in-house production and subcontractor production, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	After the spin-off of VPG, we seek to maintain selling, general, and administrative expenses at current quarterly levels, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Our fixed cost control efforts include automating administrative processes through the expansion of IT systems, gradually migrating to common IT systems across our organization, streamlining our legal entity structure, and reducing our external resource needs by utilizing more cost-effective in-house personnel, while utilizing external resources when day-to-day expertise is not required in-house.
103730_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People s Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The percentage of our total headcount in lower-labor-cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we were successful in implementing this program.
103730_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	This percentage was 74.3% at the end of 2011 as compared to 57% when this program began in 2001.
103730_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	We believe that our workforce is now appropriately located to serve our customers, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Between 2001 and 2007, we recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs totaling $223 million and related asset write-downs totaling $81 million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward.
103730_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	We also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	In response to the economic downturn which began during the latter half of 2008 and continued into 2009, we undertook significant measures to cut costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	We incurred restructuring and severance costs of $37.9 million and $62.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as part of our goal to reduce manufacturing and selling, general, and administrative fixed costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We have realized, and expect to continue to realize, significant annual net cost savings associated with these restructuring activities.
103730_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Since the latter half of 2008, we drastically reduced our break-even point by approximately $450 million.
103730_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	While streamlining and reducing fixed overhead, we exercised caution so that we will not negatively impact our customer service or our ability to further develop products and processes.
103730_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	The risks associated with our cost reduction programs are further detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
103730_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We did not initiate any new restructuring projects in 2011 or 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during such periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Because we believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, we do not anticipate any material restructuring expenses in 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Although we experienced lower demand in the last six fiscal months of 2011, we currently plan to keep our trained workforce even at lower manufacturing activity levels by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	However, the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government s grants and tax incentive programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	These benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the United States.
103730_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in prior years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The current benefits derived under these programs are not material to our consolidated results.
103730_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Because of our significant presence in Israel, the availability of these incentive programs could have a significant positive effect on us if we relocate manufacturing capacity or develop new product lines there.
103730_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	However, there are no current plans that would allow us to earn significant additional benefits.
103730_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	While we have in the past used forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures, we generally have not done so in recent periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the functional currency of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	A subsidiary s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company s operations generally would have the parent company s currency as its functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
103730_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The dollar generally was weaker in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars increasing reported revenues and expenses versus the comparable prior year periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been slightly unfavorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk.
103730_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	We have modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products, which we term a scrap allowance.
103730_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a stock, ship and debit program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	We recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	We earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	The amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by our management that we believe are reasonable.
103730_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	However, it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_12_ITEM7_P68_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	In the first step, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_12_ITEM7_P71_S3	The comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are generally the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance graph in Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
103730_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	In step two, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired those business units.
103730_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Specifically, we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
103730_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two.
103730_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Fair value of reporting units, and the underlying assets and liabilities of those reporting units, is measured at a point in time, and reflects specific market conditions as of the measurement date.
103730_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	We perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	Subsequent to recording impairment charges in 2008, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet until the acquisition of the resistors businesses of Huntington Electric, Inc. on September 28, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	We assess the impairment of our long-lived assets, other than goodwill and tradenames, including property and equipment, long-term prepaid assets, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
103730_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and evaluated as a group.
103730_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets, changes in historical or projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends.
103730_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group, primarily determined using discounted future cash flows.
103730_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (which for us are comprised entirely of tradenames) are not amortized, but similar to goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	These tests are performed more frequently if there are triggering events.
103730_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	As of December 31, 2011, one customer comprised 10.9% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	This customer comprised 8.7% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	At December 31, 2010, no customer comprised greater than 10% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_12_ITEM7_P89_S4	We use independent actuaries to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_12_ITEM7_P89_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	Plans in these countries comprise approximately 95% of our retirement obligations at December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P91_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Within the U.S., we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk.
103730_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	We expect an increase in net periodic pension cost in 2012 as a result of the amortization of unrecognized losses.
103730_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions will be required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	As a result of these amendments, net periodic pension cost for 2011, 2010, and 2009 did not include any service cost for the U.S. plans.
103730_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
103730_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	These accruals are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.
103730_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	We file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as income tax returns in multiple U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examinations of our U.S. federal tax returns for all tax years through 2002.
103730_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	Because of net operating losses, which were fully utilized on the 2010 tax return, our U.S. federal tax returns for 2003 and later years remain subject to examination.
103730_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	Examinations of most principal subsidiaries in Israel through the 2007 tax year were concluded in 2010, and we have been notified that an audit of the 2008 through 2010 tax years will commence in early 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P101_S4	The tax returns of significant non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently under examination in Germany (2005 through 2008), India (2004 through 2009), China (2006), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2006 through 2010).
103730_12_ITEM7_P101_S5	We are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	We account for uncertainty in income tax positions using the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as prescribed in GAAP.
103730_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
103730_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_12_ITEM7_P103_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Substantially all earnings generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	Statement of operations captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 represent the effects of macroeconomic concerns, which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year, and the resulting quick adaptation of our manufacturing capacities in response thereto.
103730_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	This period of macroeconomic concerns followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of the year in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession at the same sales volume.
103730_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	The recovery of our business that we began experiencing in the second half of 2009 continued throughout 2010 due to historically high overall demand for electronic components, a favorable pricing environment, and the effects of our restructuring programs initiated in the prior year and our on-going cost controlling programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	Our results in 2010 and 2011 were dramatically improved versus our 2009 results, which were substantially impacted by the 2008-2009 global economic recession.
103730_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_12_ITEM7_P111_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $80.3 million, $71.8 million, and $59.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 2.8%, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P111_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were approximately $82.3 million, $60.9 million, and $67.5 million, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P111_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $6.6 million, $5.8 million, and $5.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 27.8%, as compared to 29.6% for year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	The gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 29.4% excluding VPG.
103730_12_ITEM7_P113_S2	This decrease in gross profit margin reflects lower volume and slightly higher materials prices.
103730_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 29.6%, as compared to 19.0% for year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	This increase in gross profit margin reflects manufacturing efficiencies from significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs initiated in prior years.
103730_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the MOSFETs segment was as follows:
103730_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The MOSFETs segment is the segment most adversely affected by the decreased demand for consumer goods and the reduction in distribution orders in the second half of 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 reflects significantly lower volume and average selling prices from the historically high prices of 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, improved product mix, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	The return of the typical pricing pressure for our established MOSFETs products has reduced average selling prices from the historically high levels experienced beginning in 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	We have experienced a normal price decline versus the prior year.
103730_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Diodes segment was as follows:
103730_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	The Diodes segment was adversely affected by the reduction in distribution orders in the second half of 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	The increase in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased average selling prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume.
103730_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, improved product mix, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	After a period of increasing average selling prices in 2010, typical pricing pressure for our established Diodes products has returned.
103730_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	Average selling prices remain moderately higher versus 2010 due to the higher average selling prices in the first six fiscal months of 2011 versus 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P125_S2	Low order rates have reduced the backlog to a normal level.
103730_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Optoelectronic Components segment was as follows:
103730_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment was adversely affected by the decreased demand for consumer goods in the second half of 2011, but benefited from the continued strong demand from the automotive and industrial markets.
103730_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	Despite some fluctuations in demand, gross profit margin remained relatively steady in 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P129_S2	The slight decrease in gross profit margin versus 2010 is primarily due to a reduction from historically high average selling prices versus the prior periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P129_S3	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, improved product mix, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs, partially offset by modestly lower average selling prices and exchange rate effects.
103730_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	After a period of historically high average selling prices in 2010, typical pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products has returned.
103730_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	Due to a low order volume, the backlog has returned to a normal level.
103730_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Resistors Inductors segment was as follows:
103730_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Resistors Inductors segment was adversely affected by the economic slowdown in the second half of 2011, but continues to produce strong results.
103730_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to a slight decrease in volume.
103730_12_ITEM7_P134_S2	The increase in gross profit margin from 2009 to 2010 reflects significantly higher volume, the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs, and improved product mix, partially offset by foreign currency effects.
103730_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	Average selling prices remained relatively consistent versus 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	Due to a lower order volume, the backlog has returned to a normal level.
103730_12_ITEM7_P135_S2	The results of the Resistors Inductors segment will be strengthened by the acquisitions of Huntington Electric in the third fiscal quarter of 2011 and HiRel Systems in the first fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P135_S3	Huntington Electric expands our power resistor specialty product portfolio, while HiRel Systems expands our magnetics and power supplies specialty product portfolio.
103730_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Capacitors segment was as follows:
103730_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	The Capacitors segment was adversely affected by high distributor inventory levels in the second half of 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P139_S1	The increase in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased average selling prices, which more than offset the lower volume.
103730_12_ITEM7_P139_S2	Significantly higher volume, increased average selling prices, and the effects of our fixed cost reduction programs, partially offset by foreign currency effects, have led to the increase in gross margin from 2009 to 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	Due to a lower order volume, the backlog has returned to a normal level.
103730_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	Average selling prices remain stable, substantially higher than 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	We completed the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	Net revenues and gross margin percentage for the periods that VPG was included in our consolidated results were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ( SG A ) expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	VPG accounted for $35.4 million (including $8.4 million of costs associated with the spin-off) and $43.4 million, respectively, of SG A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
103730_12_ITEM7_P143_S1	The overall increase in SG A expenses, excluding VPG, in the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to foreign currency effects.
103730_12_ITEM7_P143_S2	The increase in SG A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues.
103730_12_ITEM7_P143_S3	The overall increase in SG A expenses, excluding VPG, in the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the resumption of bonus programs and the discontinuation of short-work and temporary shut-downs, which is partially offset by the effects of our cost controlling initiatives.
103730_12_ITEM7_P143_S4	The decrease in SG A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increase in revenues and the effects of our cost controlling initiatives.
103730_12_ITEM7_P143_S5	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	The decrease in amortization expense in 2011 versus 2010 is principally due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the acquisition of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in September 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P144_S1	The decrease in amortization expense in 2010 versus 2009 is principally due to the distribution of intangible assets to VPG in connection with the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $8.2 million versus the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P145_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 that were issued on November 9, 2010 and May 13, 2011, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line Other on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold ancillary investments in the equity of two companies located outside of the U.S. for a total gain of $1.4 million.
103730_12_ITEM7_P147_S1	The increase in interest income in 2011 is primarily due to the interest earned on the short-term investments purchased in 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $1.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt equal to the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a revolving credit commitment and term loan at the date of termination.
103730_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $0.7 million versus the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_12_ITEM7_P149_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2040 that were issued on November 9, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line Other on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the effective tax rates were 27.5% and 11.2%, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	The effective tax rates are less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
103730_12_ITEM7_P151_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a negative effective tax rate, tax expense on a pre-tax loss, primarily because we recorded tax expense on earnings in certain jurisdictions while realizing losses in other jurisdictions without recording tax benefits.
103730_12_ITEM7_P151_S3	The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was -42.3%.
103730_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge of $57.8 million discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P152_S1	We recorded no tax expense associated with the gain of $28.2 million recognized upon reimbursement of purchase price described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	These items total $3.5 million, $(59.5) million (tax benefit), and $2.0 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P153_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the discrete items included a $10.0 million expense for the effect of a tax rate change on deferred taxes in Israel recorded in the first fiscal quarter, reduced by $1.0 million for a 2010 tax return filing in the fourth fiscal quarter, and partially offset by benefits related to reductions of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions of $5.5 million recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_12_ITEM7_P153_S3	The reductions of valuation allowances were principally in Belgium due to expected future income from a pending real estate sale.
103730_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	The discrete items for the year ended December 31, 2010 were recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter and related primarily to the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and Israel.
103730_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	The discrete item for the year ended December 31, 2009 represents the effect of a rate change on deferred taxes.
103730_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_12_ITEM7_P155_S2	Part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_12_ITEM7_P155_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate.
103730_12_ITEM7_P155_S4	Changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy and to reduce debt levels.
103730_12_ITEM7_P157_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 10 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 17 years.
103730_12_ITEM7_P157_S3	A portion of the cash flows from operations was generated by VPG which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as free cash, a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repuchases or dividends.
103730_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	Vishay has generated positive free cash in each of the past 15 years, and free cash in excess of $80 million in each of the past 10 years.
103730_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations and free cash during the year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P159_S1	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	During the second fiscal quarter of 2011, we capitalized on favorable conditions and enhanced stockholder value by repurchasing shares of our common stock.
103730_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	On May 13, 2011, we completed the offering of $150 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior debentures due 2041 to qualified institutional investors.
103730_12_ITEM7_P160_S2	We used the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to repurchase 8,620,689 shares of common stock at $17.40 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million.
103730_12_ITEM7_P160_S3	The use of low-coupon, long-dated convertible debentures was a more efficient means to finance the repurchase versus repatriation of non-U.S. cash.
103730_12_ITEM7_P160_S4	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	We maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $450 million through December 1, 2015.
103730_12_ITEM7_P161_S1	The credit facility also provides for the ability for us to request up to $100 million of incremental commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P161_S2	At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $155 million and $240 million, respectively, was outstanding under the credit facility.
103730_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our then current leverage ratio.
103730_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%.
103730_12_ITEM7_P163_S1	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase if our leverage ratio exceeds 1.50 to 1.
103730_12_ITEM7_P163_S2	We are also required to pay facility commitment fees of 0.35% per annum on the entire commitment amount.
103730_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets located in the United States, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, and bank and securities accounts) of Vishay and certain significant domestic subsidiaries, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_12_ITEM7_P164_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	The credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P165_S1	On September 8, 2011, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that effectively permits us to repurchase up to $300 million of additional shares, conditioned upon maintaining specific pro forma financial ratios and a required minimum amount of available liquidity, as defined in the amendment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P165_S2	The credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_12_ITEM7_P166_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article 6 of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 1, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	We were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P167_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 21.18 to 1 and 1.10 to 1, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM7_P167_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_12_ITEM7_P168_S1	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	In 2011, we began investing a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet.
103730_12_ITEM7_P169_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_12_ITEM7_P169_S2	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 (in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	Measurements such as free cash and net cash and short-term investments (debt) do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_12_ITEM7_P171_S1	Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM7_P171_S2	However, management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends, and that an analysis of net cash and short-term investments (debt) assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	These measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	Approximately 88% of our December 31, 2011 cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P173_S1	On January 13, 2012, we used approximately $85 million of cash on-hand to acquire HiRel Systems LLC.
103730_12_ITEM7_P173_S2	This acquisition reduced our U.S. cash position.
103730_12_ITEM7_P173_S3	At the present time, we expect the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_12_ITEM7_P173_S4	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2011 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.2 to 1, as compared to a ratio of 3.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P174_S1	This increase is primarily due to an increase in cash from operations and other changes in working capital.
103730_12_ITEM7_P174_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders equity was 0.25 to 1 at December 31, 2011 as compared to a ratio of 0.29 to 1 at December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P174_S3	This decrease is primarily due the amounts repaid on the Credit Facility, partially offset by the issuance of the convertible debentures due 2041 and an increase in stockholder s equity primarily driven by net earnings available to Vishay stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	Cash flows provided by continuing operating activities were $376.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $545.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P175_S1	This decrease is principally due to $120.3 million less net earnings generated in 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $168.6 million, as compared to $145.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7_P176_S1	Due to some macroeconomic uncertainties, we expect capital spending to decrease to approximately $150 million in 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	The interest rates on our short-term investments average 2.2% and are approximately 150 basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_12_ITEM7_P177_S1	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
103730_12_ITEM7_P177_S2	Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes a net cash inflow of $15.0 million, representing the receipt of the term loan extended to KEMET as part of the wet tantalum business acquisition in 2008.
103730_12_ITEM7_P177_S3	Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a net cash inflow of $28.2 million, representing a partial refund of purchase price, net of related expenses, subsequent to entering a settlement agreement with International Rectifier Corporation.
103730_12_ITEM7_P177_S4	The settlement and loan repayment are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	Cash used by discontinued operating activities of $0.1 million and $3.2 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflect payments to settle certain outstanding disputes with the buyer of the ASBU business.
103730_12_ITEM7_P178_S1	The expenses associated with these cash payments were accrued in the fourth quarter of 2008.
103730_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	In December 2010, we borrowed $240 million under our revolving credit facility to repay the outstanding amounts under our previous credit facility.
103730_12_ITEM7_P179_S1	We borrowed $55 million and repaid $140 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P179_S2	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $193 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $240 million.
103730_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	Management expects to continue to maintain an outstanding balance of at least $100 million on the credit facility, and may periodically pay down the balance with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_12_ITEM7_P180_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, obligations under restructuring and acquisition integration programs, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_12_ITEM7_P180_S2	Acquisition activity or share repurchases may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	As of December 31, 2011 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_12_ITEM7_P182_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with our convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2041 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement, one of which bears a maturity date of 2102, and include commitment fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on December 1, 2015.
103730_12_ITEM7_P183_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2041.
103730_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P184_S1	Among other things, approximately $520 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock at the option of the holder.
103730_12_ITEM7_P184_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_12_ITEM7_P184_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our variable-rate exchangeable notes due 2102 and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2011, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 includes approximately $53.8 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_12_ITEM7_P185_S1	We expect to pay $6.3 million of the liabilities in 2012 due to the settlement of tax audits.
103730_12_ITEM7_P185_S2	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM7_P185_S3	Accordingly, the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_12_ITEM7_P186_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_12_ITEM7_P186_S2	See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_12_ITEM7_P186_S3	These obligations were not material to us as of December 31, 2011, and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above.
103730_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	We maintain long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_12_ITEM7_P187_S1	The purchase commitments in the table above include the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these agreements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P187_S2	Our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	GAAP requires that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market price.
103730_12_ITEM7_P188_S1	The purchase commitments for silicon wafers described above are for the manufacture of proprietary products using Vishay Siliconix-owned technology licensed to this subcontractor by Siliconix, and accordingly, management can only estimate the market price of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P188_S2	Management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices.
103730_12_ITEM7_P189_S0	As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, on May 13, 2009, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with the late Dr. Felix Zandman, our founder and former Executive Chairman, Chief Technical and Business Development Officer.
103730_12_ITEM7_P189_S1	Pursuant to the amended and restated employment agreement, Dr. Zandman received $10 million upon signing the agreement and five additional annual payments of $10 million each, three of which remain to be paid to his estate as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM7_P189_S2	Dr. Zandman s passing in June 2011 has no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_12_ITEM7_P190_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, executive employment agreements, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P191_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_12_ITEM7_P192_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_12_ITEM7_P192_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_12_ITEM7_P193_S0	See also Commodity Price Risk included in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional related information.
103730_12_ITEM7_P194_S0	As more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, new accounting guidance became effective in 2011 or will become effective in future periods.
103730_12_ITEM7_P195_S0	No. 2011-4, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
103730_12_ITEM7_P196_S0	The ASU generally aligns the principles for fair value measurements and the related disclosure requirements under GAAP and IFRS .
103730_12_ITEM7_P196_S1	The updated guidance clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and requires additional disclosure requirements.
103730_12_ITEM7_P197_S0	The ASU is effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P197_S1	The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have any effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-8, Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S1	Under the revised guidance, we will have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S2	If we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S3	The ASU does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S4	In addition, the ASU does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S5	The ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after January 1, 2012.
103730_12_ITEM7_P198_S6	The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have any effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM7_P199_S0	The adoption of the new guidance described above and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The exchangeable notes, of which $95 million are outstanding, bear interest at LIBOR (reset quarterly).
103730_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2011, we had $155 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2011, we have $749.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $249.1 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2011, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $2.9 million.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Also see Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S6	We also have a higher percentage of Euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S7	Therefore, when the Euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is increased.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P9_S8	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $9.8 million and $19.9 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P10_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P12_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P14_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P15_S0	We are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P15_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P15_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P16_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_12_ITEM7A_P18_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $10.7 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.
103730_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1 of this report.
103730_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

103730_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
103730_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P67_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
103730_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Vishay Intertechnology Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
103730_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_12_ITEM15_P72_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and our report dated February 23, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ( Vishay or the Company ) is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company s ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_12_ITEM15_P79_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2011 through the date these financial statements were issued through the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
103730_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_12_ITEM15_P81_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_12_ITEM15_P81_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company has modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products, which it terms a scrap allowance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P82_S2	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a stock, ship and debit program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_12_ITEM15_P82_S3	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, stock, ship and debit credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P83_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_12_ITEM15_P83_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P83_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $6,633, $5,781 and $5,710 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $55,809, $50,968, and $50,745, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Government grants received by certain subsidiaries, primarily in Israel, are recognized as income in accordance with the purpose of the specific contract and in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
103730_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	Grants recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold were $483, $543, and $688 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P88_S2	Deferred grant income included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $2,185 and $2,788 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	The grants are subject to certain conditions, including maintaining specified levels of employment for periods up to ten years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	Noncompliance with such conditions could result in the repayment of grants.
103730_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	However, management expects that the Company will comply with all terms and conditions of the grants.
103730_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of more likely than not.
103730_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	If the Company s assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_12_ITEM15_P91_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	At the present time, substantially all earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $(93), $(838), and $5,669 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P97_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P97_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.
103730_12_ITEM15_P97_S4	The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at December 31, 2011 was approximately $22,715.
103730_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense.
103730_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	Depreciation expense was $165,022, $169,724, and $206,009 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and administrative expenses).
103730_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	The required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	Certain of the Company s tradenames have been assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P102_S2	Capitalized software is amortized over periods of three to ten years, primarily included in costs of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P102_S3	Customer relationships are amortized over useful lives of five to seventeen years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P102_S4	Noncompete agreements are amortized over periods of four to ten years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P102_S5	The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_12_ITEM15_P104_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	There was no impairment identified through the annual impairment tests completed in 2011, 2010, or 2009.
103730_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_12_ITEM15_P108_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_12_ITEM15_P109_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Other assets include investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company s non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11) and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company s other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity until sold.
103730_12_ITEM15_P110_S4	At the time of sale the assets that are held in trust related to the Company s non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_12_ITEM15_P111_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_12_ITEM15_P113_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_12_ITEM15_P113_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_12_ITEM15_P113_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Company has also in the past used financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion, but not all, of its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The purpose of the Company s foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_12_ITEM15_P116_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_12_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM15_P117_S2	The Company s operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
103730_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P118_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_12_ITEM15_P119_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_12_ITEM15_P122_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_12_ITEM15_P123_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2011 and 2010 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_12_ITEM15_P126_S1	At December 31, 2011, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors and officers insurance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P126_S2	The captive insurance entity had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_12_ITEM15_P127_S1	Restricted cash of $7,637 and $8,987 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_12_ITEM15_P128_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_12_ITEM15_P128_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P128_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) updated the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements disclosures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	The updated guidance (i) requires separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements, (ii) requires disclosure of Level 3 fair value measurements activity on a gross basis, (iii) clarifies existing disaggregation requirements, (iv) and clarifies existing input and valuation technique disclosure requirements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P130_S2	The updated guidance was effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2010, except for the Level 3 fair value measurement disclosure requirements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P130_S3	Vishay adopted the then-effective aspects of the guidance on January 1, 2010 and adopted the remaining guidance on January 1, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P130_S4	The adoption of the guidance had no effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-5, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Presentation of Comprehensive Income .
103730_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	The ASU requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive statements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P131_S2	Vishay early adopted the ASU for its annual period ending December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P131_S3	The adoption of the ASU had no effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
103730_12_ITEM15_P132_S1	The ASU defers the requirement in ASU No. 2011-5 t o present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income.
103730_12_ITEM15_P132_S2	Vishay early adopted the ASU for its annual period ending December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P132_S3	The adoption of the ASU had no effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	On September 28, 2011, Vishay acquired the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric, Inc., for approximately $19,335, net of cash acquired.
103730_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for these businesses have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from September 28, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P135_S2	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $9,051 related to this acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM15_P135_S3	The goodwill associated with this transaction is deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_12_ITEM15_P135_S4	The Company will test the goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with GAAP.
103730_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	Spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	On October 27, 2009, Vishay announced that it intended to spin off its measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ( VPG ).
103730_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	On June 15, 2010, the Board of Directors of Vishay approved the spin-off of VPG and on July 6, 2010, Vishay completed the spin-off through a tax-free stock dividend to Vishay s stockholders.
103730_12_ITEM15_P139_S1	Vishay s common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and Vishay s Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_12_ITEM15_P139_S2	Upon completion of the spin-off certain executive officers received bonuses aggregating approximately $2,100, which are reflected in the results of the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its results of operations and cash flows are included in the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	The product lines that comprise VPG are included in the VPG reporting segment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	See Note 15 for further information on the effect that VPG had on Vishay s consolidated results.
103730_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	However, two members of the VPG board of directors also serve on Vishay s board of directors.
103730_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, on July 6, 2010, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	None of the agreements are expected to have a material impact on Vishay s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	Vishay also entered into a trademark license agreement with VPG pursuant to which Vishay granted VPG the license to use certain trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, entity names, and domain names which include the term Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM15_P144_S1	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term Vishay in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay s product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_12_ITEM15_P144_S2	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	Due to the common board members, transition services agreement, lease and supply agreements, and trademark license agreements with VPG, which, in the aggregate, represent significant continuing involvement, Vishay did not restate prior periods to present VPG as a discontinued operation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	In conjunction with the acquisition of the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation ( KEMET ) on September 15, 2008, Vishay issued a three-year term loan of $15,000 to KEMET.
103730_12_ITEM15_P146_S1	On May 5, 2010, KEMET prepaid the entire principal amount of the term loan plus interest, which is reflected on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from investing activities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	On April 1, 2007, Vishay completed its acquisition of the Power Control Systems business ( PCS business ) of International Rectifier for approximately $285,600, net of cash acquired.
103730_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	The final purchase price was pending the resolution of a net working capital adjustment as of the date of acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	Vishay also had notified International Rectifier of certain other claims that it had regarding the sale of the PCS business to Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	In June 2009, Vishay and International Rectifier entered into a settlement agreement.
103730_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	Under the settlement, International Rectifier refunded $30,000 of the purchase price associated with the acquisition of the PCS business and Vishay released International Rectifier from claims relating to certain outstanding disputes regarding the acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM15_P148_S2	As all goodwill associated with the PCS business was written off as part of the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, Vishay recorded a gain of $28,195 during the second fiscal quarter of 2009, equal to the amount received pursuant to the settlement agreement less certain related expenses.
103730_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	On April 7, 2008, Vishay sold the automotive modules and subsystems business unit ( ASBU ) to a private equity firm.
103730_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	ASBU was originally acquired by Vishay as part of the April 1, 2007 acquisition of International Rectifier s PCS business.
103730_12_ITEM15_P149_S2	Vishay determined that ASBU would not satisfactorily complement Vishay s operations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	The Company recorded an after tax loss of $5,690 during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 subsequent to the resolution of a net working capital adjustment and the resolution of certain disputes with the buyer.
103730_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	Portions of this amount were paid during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are reflected on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flows from discontinued operations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	On January 13, 2012, Vishay acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for approximately $85,000, including repayment of debt, and subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P151_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired will further enhance the Company s inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P151_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the business will be included in the Resistors Inductors segment beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_12_ITEM15_P152_S2	The required annual impairment test of goodwill is completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P152_S3	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_12_ITEM15_P152_S4	The Company s business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	Vishay recorded goodwill impairment charges aggregating $1,696,174 in the year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	Subsequent to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet until the acquisition of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric on September 28, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $9,051 related to this acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	All of the goodwill related to this acquisition was allocated to the Resistors Inductors business segment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	Net intangible assets of $15,371 were transferred to VPG on July 6, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $14,684, $19,817, and $22,731, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P155_S2	VPG accounted for $1,466 and $3,019 of amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2011 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	Restructuring and severance costs reflect the cost reduction programs implemented by the Company.
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	These include the closing of facilities and the termination of employees.
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S2	Restructuring and severance costs include one-time exit costs, severance benefits pursuant to an on-going benefit arrangement, and related pension curtailment and settlement charges.
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S3	Severance costs also include executive severance and charges for the fair value of stock options of certain former employees which were modified such that they did not expire at termination.
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S4	Restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which the Company determines it will incur those costs and all requirements of accrual are met.
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S5	Because these costs are recorded based upon estimates, actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P157_S6	If the initial estimates are too low or too high, the Company could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse part of the previously recorded charges.
103730_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	Asset write-downs are principally related to buildings and equipment that will not be used subsequent to the completion of restructuring plans, and cannot be sold for amounts in excess of carrying value.
103730_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company did not initiate any new restructuring projects in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance costs expenses in the years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	The Company recorded restructuring and severance costs of $37,874 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	Employee termination costs were $33,142, covering 2,571 technical, production, administrative, and support employees located in nearly every country in which the Company operates.
103730_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	Severance costs include net pension settlement charges and credits for employees in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Philippines.
103730_12_ITEM15_P160_S3	The Company also incurred $4,732 of other exit costs, principally lease termination costs related to facility closures and $681 of asset write-downs during the year ended December 31, 2009.
103730_12_ITEM15_P160_S4	The restructuring and severance costs were incurred primarily in response to the declining business conditions experienced in the second half of 2008 and recessionary trends which continued into 2009.
103730_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	Substantially all amounts related to programs initiated in 2009 have been paid as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and noncontrolling interests consists of the following components:
103730_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Significant components of income taxes are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.
103730_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	Significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company makes significant judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets (principally net operating losses).
103730_12_ITEM15_P165_S1	The carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on the Company s assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize these assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
103730_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax provision is as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had the following significant net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes:
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	Approximately $69,144 of the carryforwards in Belgium resulted from the Company s acquisition of BCcomponents in 2002.
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	Valuation allowances of $23,502 and $44,790, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been recorded through goodwill for these acquired net operating losses.
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S2	Prior to the adoption of updated guidance in ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009, if tax benefits were recognized through the utilization of these acquired net operating losses, the benefits of such loss utilization were recorded as a reduction to goodwill.
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S3	After the adoption of the updated guidance on January 1, 2009, the benefits of such losses are recorded as a reduction of tax expense.
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S4	In 2011, 2010, and 2009, the tax benefit recognized through a reduction of acquisition-date valuation allowances recorded as a reduction of tax expense was $4,299, $567, and $980, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S5	The reduction in valuation allowances include pre-acquisition allowances for losses in Austria and Netherlands.
103730_12_ITEM15_P168_S6	As of December 31, 2011, pre-acquisition net operating losses in Netherlands expired, reducing the valuation allowances by $16,495.
103730_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had the following significant tax credit carryforwards available:
103730_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	At December 31, 2011, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,493,797 of foreign earnings, which the Company continues to expect to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	As of December 31, 2008, the Company recorded additional tax expense for an expected repatriation of $112,500 because such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
103730_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the remaining balance of these not permanently reinvested earnings is $72,110.
103730_12_ITEM15_P172_S2	At the present time, the Company expects that the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.
103730_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	Net income taxes paid (refunded) were $126,918, $23,322, and ($4,714) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P174_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_12_ITEM15_P175_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P176_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_12_ITEM15_P176_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_12_ITEM15_P176_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	Until the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, VPG was included in the Company s consolidated federal income tax returns and will be included with the Company and/or certain of the Company s subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.
103730_12_ITEM15_P177_S1	In conjunction with the spin-off, the Company and VPG entered a tax matters agreement under which the Company generally will be liable for all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes attributable to VPG with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the distribution date except to the extent that VPG has a liability for such taxes on its books at the time of the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P177_S2	The Company is also principally responsible for managing any income tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions for pre-spin-off periods.
103730_12_ITEM15_P177_S3	The Company has fully indemnified VPG of tax exposures arising prior to the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_12_ITEM15_P178_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $5,764 and $2,962, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P178_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recognized $3,795, $1,081, and $1,139, respectively, in interest and penalties.
103730_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	The amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate is $53,808.
103730_12_ITEM15_P180_S1	The Company expects that the unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next year by $6,262 due to the settlement of tax audits, principally in Germany.
103730_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as income tax returns in multiple U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P181_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examinations of Vishay s U.S. federal tax returns for all tax years through 2002.
103730_12_ITEM15_P181_S2	Because of net operating losses, which were fully utilized on the 2010 tax return, the Company s U.S. federal tax returns for 2003 and later years remain subject to examination.
103730_12_ITEM15_P181_S3	Examinations of most principal subsidiaries in Israel through the 2007 tax year were concluded in 2010, and the Company has been notified that an audit of the 2008 through 2010 tax years will commence in early 2012.
103730_12_ITEM15_P181_S4	The tax returns of significant non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently under examination in Germany (2005 through 2008), India (2004 through 2009), China (2006), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2006 through 2010).
103730_12_ITEM15_P181_S5	The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan as administrative agent (the Credit Facility ).
103730_12_ITEM15_P183_S1	On December 1, 2010, Vishay borrowed $240,000 under the Credit Facility to repay all of the outstanding amounts under its previously existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks led by Comerica Bank that was scheduled to expire on April 20, 2012.
103730_12_ITEM15_P183_S2	The Company repaid $85,000 of the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility in year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P184_S0	The Credit Facility provides a commitment of up to $450,000 through December 1, 2015.
103730_12_ITEM15_P184_S1	The Credit Facility also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $100,000 of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P184_S2	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_12_ITEM15_P184_S3	The applicable interest margin is based on Vishay s then current leverage ratio.
103730_12_ITEM15_P185_S0	Based on the Company s current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%.
103730_12_ITEM15_P185_S1	The interest rate on the Company s borrowings will increase if the Company s leverage ratio increases to 1.50 to 1.
103730_12_ITEM15_P185_S2	Vishay is also required to pay facility commitment fees of 0.35% per annum on the entire commitment amount.
103730_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets located in the United States, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, and bank and securities accounts) of Vishay and certain significant domestic subsidiaries, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P186_S1	Certain of the Company s subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P186_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by Vishay.
103730_12_ITEM15_P186_S3	The Credit Facility also restricts the Company from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments, and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_12_ITEM15_P187_S0	On September 8, 2011, Vishay entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility.
103730_12_ITEM15_P187_S1	The amendment effectively permits up to $300,000 of additional share repurchases, conditioned upon Vishay maintaining (i) a pro forma leverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.00, (ii) a pro forma interest expense coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00, and (iii) $400,000 of available liquidity, as defined in the amendment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P187_S2	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of Vishay s Board of Directors.
103730_12_ITEM15_P187_S3	Other significant terms and conditions of the Credit Facility have not changed.
103730_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P188_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, Vishay s obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_12_ITEM15_P189_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there was $286,995 and $210,000, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.

103730_12_ITEM15_P190_S1	Vishay used the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to repurchase 8,620,689 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000.
103730_12_ITEM15_P191_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_12_ITEM15_P191_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures due 2041 are reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P193_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at a rate of 2.25% per annum; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate of 8.375% based on the Company s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P193_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, beginning on May 15, 2021, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances.
103730_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	Interest expense related to the convertible debentures due 2041 is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	Prior to February 15, 2041, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending October 1, 2011 if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price (currently, $24.73) for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay s common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	None of these conditions had occurred as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	The debentures are initially convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of Vishay s common stock or a combination thereof, at Vishay s option, at an initial conversion rate of 52.5659 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P196_S1	This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $19.02 per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P196_S2	This initial conversion price represents a premium of 12.5% to the closing price of Vishay s common stock on the date the offering commenced, which was $16.91 per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P196_S3	At the direction of its Board of Directors, Vishay intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares.
103730_12_ITEM15_P196_S4	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a fundamental change in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to May 20, 2021, except in connection with certain tax-related events.
103730_12_ITEM15_P197_S1	On or after May 20, 2021 and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay s common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_12_ITEM15_P198_S0	On November 9, 2010, Vishay issued $275,000 principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior debentures due 2040 to qualified institutional investors.

103730_12_ITEM15_P199_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of a convertible debt instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_12_ITEM15_P199_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures due 2040 are reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P201_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at a rate of 2.25% per annum; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate of 8.00% based on the Company s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P201_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, beginning on November 15, 2020, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances.
103730_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	Interest expense related to the convertible debentures due 2040 is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	Prior to April 15, 2040, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending April 2, 2011 if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price (currently, $18.04) for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay s common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_12_ITEM15_P203_S1	None of these conditions had occurred as of December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	The debentures are initially convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of Vishay s common stock or a combination thereof, at Vishay s option, at an initial conversion rate of 72.0331 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P204_S1	This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $13.88 per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P204_S2	This initial conversion price represents a premium of 12.5% to the closing price of Vishay s common stock on November 3, which was $12.34 per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P204_S3	At the direction of its Board of Directors, Vishay intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares.
103730_12_ITEM15_P204_S4	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a fundamental change in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to November 20, 2020, except in connection with certain tax-related events.
103730_12_ITEM15_P205_S1	On or after November 20, 2020 and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay s common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_12_ITEM15_P206_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_12_ITEM15_P206_S1	The notes are governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_12_ITEM15_P206_S2	The notes may be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, may be called by Vishay for similar consideration.
103730_12_ITEM15_P207_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes are deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_12_ITEM15_P208_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spin-off, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,042 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P208_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P209_S0	The notes are subject to a put and call agreement under which the holders may at any time put the notes to Vishay in exchange for 6,176,471 shares of Vishay s common stock in the aggregate, and Vishay may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.
103730_12_ITEM15_P209_S1	The put/call rate of the Vishay notes is $15.39 per share of common stock.
103730_12_ITEM15_P210_S0	The notes bear interest at LIBOR.
103730_12_ITEM15_P210_S1	Interest continues to be payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each calendar year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P210_S2	The interest rate could be further reduced to 50% of LIBOR if the price of Vishay s common stock is above $40.73 per share for thirty or more consecutive trading days.
103730_12_ITEM15_P211_S0	In 2003, Vishay sold $500,000 aggregate principal amount of 3-5/8% convertible subordinated notes due 2023.
103730_12_ITEM15_P211_S1	Holders of substantially all (99.6%) of the 3-5/8% notes exercised their option to require Vishay to repurchase their notes on August 1, 2008.
103730_12_ITEM15_P211_S2	The remaining notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $1,870, were redeemed at Vishay s option on August 1, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P212_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P213_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P213_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2041 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_12_ITEM15_P214_S0	In 2010, the Company repaid a $13,500 Israeli bank loan and the balance of a $90,000 term loan under a previous credit facility.
103730_12_ITEM15_P215_S0	In 2009, the Company paid $25,000 of scheduled principal payments on the term loan.
103730_12_ITEM15_P216_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $15,500, which was substantially unused.

103730_12_ITEM15_P217_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately $8,200.
103730_12_ITEM15_P217_S1	These letters of credit were replaced in 2011 by letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.
103730_12_ITEM15_P218_S0	Interest paid was $14,084, $9,120, and $10,243 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P219_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company s long-term debt.
103730_12_ITEM15_P220_S0	The Company s Class B common stock carries ten votes per share while the common stock carries one vote per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P220_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_12_ITEM15_P220_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_12_ITEM15_P220_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_12_ITEM15_P221_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_12_ITEM15_P221_S1	The Company s revolving credit facility currently prohibits the payment of cash dividends (see Note 6).
103730_12_ITEM15_P221_S2	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_12_ITEM15_P221_S3	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.

103730_12_ITEM15_P222_S1	The Company repurchased 21,721,959 shares of its common stock on November 9, 2010 for $275,000.
103730_12_ITEM15_P222_S2	On September 8, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility that effectively permits up to $300,000 of additional share repurchases, conditioned upon the Company maintaining specific pro forma financial ratios and a required minimum amount of available liquidity, as defined in the amendment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P222_S3	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of the Company s Board of Directors.
103730_12_ITEM15_P223_S0	The Company issued 8,823,529 warrants to acquire shares of Vishay common stock as part of the purchase price for the 2002 acquisition of BCcomponents.
103730_12_ITEM15_P223_S1	As a consequence of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, the exercise price of the warrants was reduced 9.48% to reflect the loss of value to the warrant holder due to the decrease in the trading price of Vishay s common stock as a result of the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P223_S2	Of these warrants, 7,000,000 have an exercise price of $18.10 per share, and 1,823,529 have an exercise price of $27.43 per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P223_S3	These warrants expire in December 2012.

103730_12_ITEM15_P225_S0	*The convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 are convertible into 19,809,103 and 7,884,885 shares, respectively, of Vishay common stock.
103730_12_ITEM15_P226_S0	The Company has reserved the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_12_ITEM15_P227_S0	The caption Other on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P228_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold ancillary investments in the equity of two companies located outside of the U.S. for a total gain of $1,396.
103730_12_ITEM15_P228_S1	The increase in interest income in 2011 is primarily due to the interest earned on the short-term investments purchased in 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P229_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a $1,659 loss on the early extinguishment of debt equal to the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a revolving credit commitment and term loan at the date of termination.
103730_12_ITEM15_P230_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P231_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P232_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay s proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_12_ITEM15_P233_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_12_ITEM15_P234_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_12_ITEM15_P234_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_12_ITEM15_P235_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_12_ITEM15_P236_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_12_ITEM15_P237_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_12_ITEM15_P237_S1	These include pension plans which are qualified under Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) and the Internal Revenue Code, and non-qualified pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_12_ITEM15_P237_S2	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P238_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans include both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_12_ITEM15_P238_S1	The Company s principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_12_ITEM15_P238_S2	The Company s other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P239_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_12_ITEM15_P239_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_12_ITEM15_P239_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P239_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_12_ITEM15_P240_S0	The Company s other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P241_S0	The Company s principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_12_ITEM15_P241_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_12_ITEM15_P242_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_12_ITEM15_P242_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a rabbi trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_12_ITEM15_P242_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_12_ITEM15_P242_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P242_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $14,423 and $14,922 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P243_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_12_ITEM15_P243_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_12_ITEM15_P243_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P243_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_12_ITEM15_P244_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_12_ITEM15_P244_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a rabbi trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $5,445 at December 31, 2011.
103730_12_ITEM15_P245_S6	Prior to 2011, these pension benefits were unfunded.
103730_12_ITEM15_P246_S0	On June 16, 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul s and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman s employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_12_ITEM15_P246_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P246_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_12_ITEM15_P247_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_12_ITEM15_P247_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P248_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:
103730_12_ITEM15_P249_S0	The plan assets are stated at fair value.
103730_12_ITEM15_P249_S1	See Note 18 for further discussion of the valuation of the plan assets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P250_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P251_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P252_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the projected and accumulated benefit obligations:
103730_12_ITEM15_P253_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost:
103730_12_ITEM15_P254_S0	See Note 10 for the pretax, tax effect and after tax amounts included in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.
103730_12_ITEM15_P254_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2012 is $16,300.
103730_12_ITEM15_P255_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_12_ITEM15_P256_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
103730_12_ITEM15_P257_S0	The plans expected return on assets is based on management s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_12_ITEM15_P257_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P258_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S0	The Company s U.S. defined benefit plans are invested in diversified portfolios of public-market equity and fixed income securities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S1	Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and, in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S2	The target allocation has historically been approximately 60% invested in equity securities and 40% invested in fixed income securities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S3	The Company s non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S4	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S5	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P259_S6	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P260_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_12_ITEM15_P261_S0	The Company anticipates making contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans of between $12,000 and $16,000 in 2012.
103730_12_ITEM15_P262_S0	The Company s anticipated 2012 contributions for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans will approximate the expected benefit payments disclosed above.
103730_12_ITEM15_P263_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_12_ITEM15_P263_S1	One of these plans was amended effective January 1, 2009, which reduced the benefit obligations of the Company.
103730_12_ITEM15_P263_S2	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P264_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into formal employment agreements with six of its executives.
103730_12_ITEM15_P264_S1	These employment agreements provide medical benefits for these executives and their surviving spouses for life, up to a stated maximum annual premium value per person.
103730_12_ITEM15_P264_S2	The Company subsequently entered into similar agreements with additional executives.
103730_12_ITEM15_P264_S3	These benefits are fully vested, and accordingly, the obligations represented prior service costs which will be amortized over the average remaining expected services period for these executives.
103730_12_ITEM15_P265_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and accrued benefit cost related to U.S. and non-U.S. non-pension defined benefit postretirement plans:
103730_12_ITEM15_P266_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P267_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_12_ITEM15_P268_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost:
103730_12_ITEM15_P269_S0	The estimated actuarial items for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2012 are not material and approximate the amounts amortized in 2011.

103730_12_ITEM15_P333_S0	On May 13, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman (the 2009 Agreement ).
103730_12_ITEM15_P333_S1	This agreement amended and restated the employment agreement between the Company and Dr. Zandman that was previously amended and restated as of January 1, 2004 (the 2004 Agreement ).
103730_12_ITEM15_P334_S0	The purpose of the 2009 Agreement was to eliminate the right of Dr. Zandman to receive a royalty during the ten years following his termination of employment equal to 5% of gross sales, less returns and allowances, of Vishay products incorporating inventions and any other form of technology created, discovered or developed by him or under his direction.
103730_12_ITEM15_P334_S1	The royalty was payable in the event Dr. Zandman was terminated without cause or resigned for good reason, as defined in the 2004 Agreement.
103730_12_ITEM15_P334_S2	This provision was carried over from Dr. Zandman s original employment agreement of March 1985, and could not be modified or eliminated without Dr. Zandman s consent.
103730_12_ITEM15_P334_S3	It was a reflection, among other things, of Dr. Zandman s key role in the founding of the Company and in creating, developing and commercializing the Company s technologies and the absence of any compensation to Dr. Zandman for the core intellectual property that he contributed to the Company over the years from its inception.
103730_12_ITEM15_P335_S0	The Company engaged a consultant in 2007 to assist its evaluation of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment to be terminated.
103730_12_ITEM15_P335_S1	Based in part upon the work of this consultant and management s own updated computations, management estimated that the present value of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment terminated at December 31, 2008 would have been between approximately $370,000 and $445,000, with a possible tax gross-up if the royalties were payable in connection with a change of control and deemed subject to an excise tax.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Dr. Zandman s right to the royalty payments was terminated.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S1	Dr. Zandman received a payment of $10,000 as of the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, and his estate is entitled to receive annual payments of $10,000 each through 2014.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S2	Dr. Zandman s passing in June 2011 has no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S3	The Company recognized compensation expense of $57,824 during the second quarter of 2009, representing the present value of these payments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S4	This amount is presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S5	The Company recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge.
103730_12_ITEM15_P336_S6	At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $19,400 and $10,000 accrued in other liabilities and other accrued expenses, respectively, for this liability.
103730_12_ITEM15_P337_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense of $3,889 reported as a component of the executive compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 for other elements of compensation that accelerated upon the passing of Dr. Zandman.
103730_12_ITEM15_P338_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense of $1,873 reported as a component of the executive compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 for elements of compensation payable to the Company s former Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Lior Yahalomi, in connection with his resignation.
103730_12_ITEM15_P339_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of net revenues, a material portion of the Company s revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P339_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_12_ITEM15_P339_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company s products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial position.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company s large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S2	As of December 31, 2011, one customer comprised 10.9% of the Company s accounts receivable balance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S3	This customer comprised 8.7% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S4	As of December 31, 2010, no customer comprised greater than 10% of the Company s accounts receivable balance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S5	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_12_ITEM15_P340_S6	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P341_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P341_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_12_ITEM15_P341_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company s combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_12_ITEM15_P342_S0	Many of the Company s products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_12_ITEM15_P342_S1	The Company s consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_12_ITEM15_P342_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company s customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_12_ITEM15_P342_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s net earnings.
103730_12_ITEM15_P343_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum.
103730_12_ITEM15_P344_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_12_ITEM15_P344_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_12_ITEM15_P345_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_12_ITEM15_P345_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company s ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_12_ITEM15_P345_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company s ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company s products.
103730_12_ITEM15_P346_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company s products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_12_ITEM15_P346_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company s policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_12_ITEM15_P346_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P347_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 78% of revenues earned during 2011 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_12_ITEM15_P347_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, $875,073 of the Company s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_12_ITEM15_P347_S2	Some of the Company s products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_12_ITEM15_P347_S3	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_12_ITEM15_P347_S4	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company s ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company s overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_12_ITEM15_P348_S0	As of December 31, 2011 the Company s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_12_ITEM15_P349_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 41 years.
103730_12_ITEM15_P349_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_12_ITEM15_P350_S0	In preparation for the spin-off of VPG, which was completed on July 6, 2010, the Company realigned its reportable business segments structure in the second fiscal quarter of 2010 to be consistent with changes made to its management reporting.
103730_12_ITEM15_P350_S1	The changes made to management reporting included separating the former Semiconductors reporting segment into MOSFETs, Diodes, and Optoelectronic Components and separating the former Passive components reporting segment into Resistors and Inductors, Capacitors, and VPG.
103730_12_ITEM15_P350_S2	The changes were necessary due to the former Passive components segment no longer being comparable after the completion of the spin-off of VPG, the need for discrete information regarding VPG, and the increased interest of management and outside investors in more discrete financial information.
103730_12_ITEM15_P351_S0	Effective beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2010, the chief operating decision maker began making strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on this new segment structure.
103730_12_ITEM15_P351_S1	Following the completion of the spin-off in the third fiscal quarter, the Company has five reporting segments.
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ( segment operating income ).
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S1	Beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2010, the Company changed its definition of segment operating income to exclude such costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups.
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S2	These costs are managed by executives that report to the chief operating decision maker and were formerly included in segment operating income.
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S3	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S4	Additionally, management has always evaluated segment performance excluding items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gains or losses on purchase commitments, and other items.
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S5	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_12_ITEM15_P352_S6	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_12_ITEM15_P353_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_12_ITEM15_P354_S0	The Company has also disclosed certain additional items not used to evaluate segment performance.
103730_12_ITEM15_P354_S1	In some cases, the items are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are required to be disclosed by GAAP.
103730_12_ITEM15_P354_S2	Additionally, the additional segment disclosures may provide insight to the Company s future profitability by reportable segment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P355_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_12_ITEM15_P356_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows are included in the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_12_ITEM15_P356_S1	Excluding the non-recurring costs of the spin-off incurred by Vishay, VPG contributed $9,716 of income before taxes, $5,811 of net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders, and $0.03 per diluted share attributable to Vishay stockholders to Vishay s 2010 results.
103730_12_ITEM15_P357_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_12_ITEM15_P358_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, Vishay made changes to its business model to streamline its sales process such that three main subsidiaries will generate the majority of future third-party sales.
103730_12_ITEM15_P359_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_12_ITEM15_P360_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_12_ITEM15_P360_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), warrants (see Note 7), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P361_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM15_P362_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_12_ITEM15_P363_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_12_ITEM15_P364_S0	The Company s convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_12_ITEM15_P364_S1	While none of these events has occurred as of December 31, 2011, certain conditions which could trigger conversion have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_12_ITEM15_P365_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040 and due 2041, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_12_ITEM15_P365_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method (similar to options and warrants) rather than the if converted method otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_12_ITEM15_P365_S2	Under the treasury stock method, Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the notes based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_12_ITEM15_P365_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.88, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, and if the average market price is less than $19.02, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041.
103730_12_ITEM15_P366_S0	As described in Note 6, the Company purchased 99.6% of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes due 2023 pursuant to the option of the holders to require the Company to repurchase their notes on August 1, 2008.
103730_12_ITEM15_P366_S1	The remaining notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $1,870, were redeemed at Vishay s option on August 1, 2010.
103730_12_ITEM15_P367_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_12_ITEM15_P368_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_12_ITEM15_P368_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_12_ITEM15_P368_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_12_ITEM15_P369_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_12_ITEM15_P370_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_12_ITEM15_P370_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_12_ITEM15_P371_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P372_S0	An asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_12_ITEM15_P373_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
103730_12_ITEM15_P374_S0	The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as rabbi trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans.
103730_12_ITEM15_P374_S1	Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale and company-owned life insurance assets.
103730_12_ITEM15_P374_S2	The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P374_S3	The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company s insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts.
103730_12_ITEM15_P374_S4	The fair value measurement of the marketable securities held in the rabbi trust is considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

103730_12_ITEM15_P377_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_12_ITEM15_P378_S0	The group annuity contract consists of a general asset account and a pooled separate account.
103730_12_ITEM15_P378_S1	Units of the general asset account are valued based on a discounted cash flow model using the current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations and similar credit risk.
103730_12_ITEM15_P378_S2	The pooled separate accounts are valued based on the value of the underlying bond funds, which are valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year, with adjustments made to reflect the nature of how the investment is held.
103730_12_ITEM15_P379_S0	The fair value measurement of the group annuity contract is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_12_ITEM15_P380_S0	The short-term investment fund strictly invests in short-term investments, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, U.S. government obligations, corporate notes, and funding agreements.
103730_12_ITEM15_P380_S1	The maturity date of all investments held by the short-term investment fund is within one year from the financial statement date.
103730_12_ITEM15_P380_S2	There are no redemption restrictions on the plan s investment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P381_S0	The fair value of the short-term investment fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investment.
103730_12_ITEM15_P381_S1	The fair value measurement of the short-term investment fund is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_12_ITEM15_P382_S0	Real estate investments held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of real estate investment trust securities that are valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.

103730_12_ITEM15_P385_S0	Cash held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consists of deposits on account in various financial institutions.
103730_12_ITEM15_P385_S1	The carrying amount of the cash approximates its fair value.
103730_12_ITEM15_P386_S0	The Company holds available for sale investments in debt securities that are intended to fund a portion of its other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S. and equity securities in a non-U.S. company.
103730_12_ITEM15_P386_S1	The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_12_ITEM15_P386_S2	The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_12_ITEM15_P387_S0	The convertible senior debentures, due 2040 and due 2041, issued by the Company on November 9, 2010 and May 13, 2011, respectively, contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period.
103730_12_ITEM15_P387_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_12_ITEM15_P388_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_12_ITEM15_P388_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company s current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_12_ITEM15_P388_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management s judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P389_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_12_ITEM15_P390_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability, at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is approximately $533,900 and $624,800, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability, of $398,068 and $431,363, respectively.
103730_12_ITEM15_P390_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_12_ITEM15_P391_S0	The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, long-term notes receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.

103730_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of our measurements and foil resistor businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("Vishay Precision Group" or "VPG") through a tax- free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	In the 1950's, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with a loan from the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	These products became part of Vishay Precision Group, which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	In the early 1990's, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay's global market position in passive components.
103730_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; and the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011.
103730_13_ITEM1_P5_S5	On January 13, 2012, we acquired HiRel Systems, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	In the late 1990's, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Vishay's next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay's acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	We also acquired several businesses as part of our Measurements Group's strategy of vertical market integration.
103730_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The measurements business became part of VPG, which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	We continue to implement the vision, strategy, and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman as we continue to work tirelessly to enhance value for our stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Vishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2143.
103730_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our telephone number is (610) 644-1300.
103730_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We were founded based on the inventions of Dr. Felix Zandman and we continue to emphasize technological innovation as a driver of growth.
103730_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.

103730_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	The breadth of our product portfolio along with the proximity of our field application engineers to customers provides increased opportunities to have our components selected and designed into new end products by customers in all relevant market segments.
103730_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through accelerating the development of new products and technologies and increasing design-in opportunities by expanding our technical resources for providing solutions to customers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	We are a leading manufacturer in our industry, with a broad product portfolio, access to a wide range of end markets and sales channels, and geographic diversity.
103730_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We have solid, well-established relationships with our customers and strong distribution channels.
103730_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our senior management team is highly experienced, with deep industry knowledge.
103730_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	Over the past two decades, our management team has successfully restructured our company and integrated several acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM1_P14_S4	We can adapt our operations to changing economic conditions, as demonstrated by our ability to remain profitable and generate cash through the volatile economic cycle of the recent past.
103730_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have the broadest product line of discrete semiconductors and passive components among our competitors.
103730_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our broad product portfolio allows us to penetrate markets in all industry segments and all regions, which reduces our exposure to a particular end market or geographic location.
103730_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through improving market penetration by expanding manufacturing facilities for our most successful products, increasing technical resources, and developing markets for specialty products in Asia.
103730_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our net revenues, excluding VPG, for the following applicable periods were attributable to customers in the following regions:
103730_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	The share of net revenues, excluding VPG, by end market was as follows:
103730_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Since 1985, we have expanded our product line through various strategic acquisitions, growing from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.
103730_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We have successfully integrated the acquired companies within our existing management and operational structure, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales and administrative functions, creating manufacturing synergies, while improving customer service.
103730_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	We often target high margin niche business acquisitions, such as Huntington Electric and HiRel Systems, which we acquired in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM1_P17_S4	These acquisitions accounted for 2.8% of 2012 revenues and have margins above our corporate average.
103730_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 16 years and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 11 years.
103730_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures in prior periods and continued cost control activities (see "Cost Management" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") will continue our "free cash" generation going forward.
103730_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2012, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $599.6 million.
103730_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $528 million through December 1, 2015, of which $431.3 million was available as of December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong "free cash" flow generation provide financial strength and flexibility and reduces our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have licenses to use, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
103730_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We plan to continue to use our research and development ("R D"), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	As part of our plan to foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by 15% since 2009 and plan to further increase it and we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase the design-in of our products in local markets.
103730_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our success.
103730_13_ITEM1_P26_S3	We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop new innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products to make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends.
103730_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Over the past several years we implemented programs to optimize our labor distribution across the globe.
103730_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	After successfully realigning our labor distribution, our focus is directed to controlling fixed costs and reducing variable costs.
103730_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	We plan to continue to expand within the electronic components industry, through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product innovation, quality, and reliability, strong customer bases, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	We maintain significant production facilities in those regions where we market the bulk of our products in order to enhance the service and responsiveness that we provide to our customers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	We aim to further strengthen our relationships with customers and strategic partners by providing broad product lines that allow us to provide "one-stop shop" service, whereby they can streamline their design and purchasing processes by ordering multiple types of products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our growth plan was designed based on the tenets of the key business strategies listed above.

103730_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	They store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Important applications for capacitors include electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies; decoupling and bypass of electronic signals for integrated circuits and circuit boards; and frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applications.
103730_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	We manufacture products based on all major capacitor technologies: tantalum (molded chip tantalum, coated chip tantalum, solid through-hole tantalum, and wet tantalum), ceramic (multilayer chip and ceramic disc), film, power, heavy-current, and aluminum electrolytic.
103730_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our capacitors range from tiny surface-mount devices for hearing aids and mobile devices to large power correction capacitors used in renewable energy, heavy industry, and electrical power grids.
103730_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	We are a recognized technology leader in many product ranges, securing our strong position in military and medical markets, and in a wide range of industrial and automotive applications.
103730_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	Our wet tantalum and MicroTan technologies are market leaders.
103730_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by United States government agencies, and under certain European military specifications.
103730_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	Qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product's classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed "dies" or "chips") on each wafer.
103730_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed "packages") that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_13_ITEM1_P63_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel (see "Israeli Operations" below).
103730_13_ITEM1_P63_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Dominican Republic, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_13_ITEM1_P63_S5	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	The majority of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification and others are actively pursuing such approval.
103730_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government's grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	The current benefits derived under these programs are not material to our consolidated results.
103730_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Because of our significant presence in Israel, the availability of these incentive programs could have a significant positive effect on us if we relocate manufacturing capacity or develop new product lines there.
103730_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	However, there are no substantial plans that would allow us to earn additional benefits.
103730_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	We could be materially adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	However, we have not experienced any material interruption in our Israeli operations during our 42 years of operations there, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_13_ITEM1_P78_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2012 is shown below:
103730_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers' specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating pricing and contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_13_ITEM1_P81_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer's business requirements.
103730_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ("FAEs") to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers' engineering needs.
103730_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_13_ITEM1_P83_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay "design-in" the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_13_ITEM1_P83_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_13_ITEM1_P83_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_13_ITEM1_P84_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:
103730_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	MOSFETs: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, International Rectifier, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Diodes: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Optoelectronic Components: Avago, Rohm, Sharp, Toshiba.
103730_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	Resistors and Inductors: KOA, Murata, Panasonic, Rohm, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Capacitors: AVX, KEMET, Murata, Nichicon, Panasonic, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	There are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete.
103730_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability, technological innovation, business reputation, and price competitiveness.
103730_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People's Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity's or individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_13_ITEM1_P102_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1_P107_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_13_ITEM1_P107_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_13_ITEM1_P107_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 21,600 full time employees, of whom approximately 88% were located outside the United States.
103730_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_13_ITEM1_P108_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_13_ITEM1_P109_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_13_ITEM1_P110_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_13_ITEM1_P110_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_13_ITEM1_P110_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_13_ITEM1_P111_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_13_ITEM1_P111_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and the periods of decline we are presently experiencing may continue and may become more pronounced.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry are presently experiencing a decline in product demand on a global basis.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	This decline may continue and may become more pronounced.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A decline in product demand on a global basis could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $393 million as of December 31, 2012, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P28_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the current period of economic slowdown.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P40_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 74% of our revenues during 2012 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 42 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We obtain substantial benefits by operating in Israel, but these benefits may not continue.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the Israeli government's grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	There can also be no assurance that in the future the Israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that, if it does, such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to benefit from them.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Any significant increase in the Israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the Israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Because we believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, we do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Approximately 98% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2012, $974 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	At the present time, we expect the cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.

103730_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	At December 31, 2012, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 48.0% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P65_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.5% of our Class B common stock, representing 43.1% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P69_S2	As a result of the passing of our founder and Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.5% of our Class B common stock, representing 43.1% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Such holders may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P69_S4	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If the VPG spin-off transaction is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax could incur substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The VPG spin-off transaction was conditioned upon Vishay's receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and an opinion of tax counsel (the "Opinion") confirming that the VPG spin-off transaction should qualify as tax-free to us and our stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, and representations from us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' businesses and other matters.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Any inaccuracy in these facts, assumptions, or representations could invalidate the ruling, and we and our stockholders could be subject to substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and Opinion, the IRS or state or local tax authorities (collectively with the IRS, the "Tax Authorities") could determine on audit that the VPG spin-off transaction should be treated as a taxable transaction if the Tax Authorities determine that any of these facts, assumptions, or representations are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of our company or VPG after the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Under the tax matters agreement between our company and VPG, VPG generally would be required to indemnify our company against its taxes resulting from the failure of the VPG spin-off transaction to qualify as tax-free ("Transaction Taxes") as a result of (i) any action by VPG or any of its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would reasonably be expected to prevent the spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction to us and our stockholders (ii) any action by VPG or its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would be inconsistent with any material information or representation made in connection with the private letter ruling obtained by us from the IRS and/or with the Opinion or (iii) certain other actions taken by VPG.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	However, in the event that Transaction Taxes are incurred for any other reason, we would not be entitled to indemnification.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In addition, due to the potential impact of significant stock ownership changes on the taxability of the spin-off to us, we and VPG may determine not to enter into transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, such as issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs or acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities, if such issuances would exceed certain thresholds and such actions could be considered part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name .
103730_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the "Vishay" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the "Vishay" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2012, our business had 49 manufacturing locations.
103730_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.
103730_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some locations include both owned and leased facilities in the same location.
103730_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The list of manufacturing facilities below excludes manufacturing facilities that are presently idle due to our restructuring activities.
103730_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment generally are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs.
103730_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
103730_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The principal locations of our owned manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	The principal locations of our leased manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
103730_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	During the past few years, we settled several suits which we had initiated to enforce our intellectual property rights.
103730_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	We are receiving royalties on sales of these companies' products which use our technology.
103730_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	We are continuing to assert our legal rights against other parties which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights.
103730_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	In January 2005, an amended class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California on behalf of all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix against Vishay, Ernst Young LLP (the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company's financial statements), Dr. Felix Zandman, former Executive Chairman and Chief Technical and Business Development Officer of Vishay, and as a nominal defendant, Siliconix.
103730_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	The suit made various claims against Vishay and the other defendants for actions allegedly taken in respect of Siliconix during the period when Vishay owned an 80.4% interest in Siliconix.
103730_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	The action, which we refer to as the Proctor litigation on account of the lead plaintiff, sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
103730_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	In May 2005, Vishay successfully completed a tender offer to acquire all shares of Siliconix that were not already owned by Vishay.
103730_13_ITEM3_P4_S1	Following the announcement of Vishay's intent to make this tender offer, several purported class-action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
103730_13_ITEM3_P4_S2	These actions were consolidated into a single class action and a settlement agreement was reached with the plaintiffs, who effectively represented all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix.
103730_13_ITEM3_P4_S3	The settlement agreement was approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery in October 2005.
103730_13_ITEM3_P5_S0	The plaintiffs in the Proctor litigation filed an amended complaint in the Superior Court of California in November 2005.
103730_13_ITEM3_P5_S1	In June 2006, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a permanent injunction restraining the Proctor plaintiffs from prosecuting the Proctor action.
103730_13_ITEM3_P5_S2	An appeal of the injunction order brought by a former stockholder of Siliconix was dismissed by the Delaware Supreme Court in January 2007.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S0	In June 2006, the Proctor litigation was removed from the Superior Court of California to federal District Court.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S1	The District Court granted a motion by Ernst Young to dismiss the complaint and a motion by Vishay for summary judgment, effective October 15, 2007.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S2	The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and on October 9, 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Proctor's class action claim and remanded the remaining two claims to state court.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S3	On July 26, 2011, the Superior Court dismissed the remaining claims against Vishay with prejudice.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S4	On September 20, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S5	On December 11, 2012, the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Sixth Appellate District, heard oral arguments from the parties on the matter.
103730_13_ITEM3_P6_S6	On February 19, 2013, the Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court's dismissal of the remaining claims.
103730_13_ITEM3_P7_S0	Vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by Vishay and its subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_13_ITEM3_P8_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM3_P9_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.

103730_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM5_P2_S3	Holders of record of our common stock totaled approximately 1,200 at February 18, 2013.
103730_13_ITEM5_P2_S4	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.
103730_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, the high and low sales prices of our common stock.
103730_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	At February 18, 2013, we had outstanding 12,129,227 shares of Class B common stock, par value $.10 per share, each of which entitles the holder to ten votes.
103730_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Class B common stock generally is not transferable except in certain very limited instances, and there is no market for those shares.
103730_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Class B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock on a share for share basis.

103730_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Vishay's common stock over a 5 year period with the returns on the Standard Poor's MidCap 400 Stock Index (of which Vishay is a component), the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index, and a peer group of companies selected by our management.
103730_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	The peer group is made up of five publicly-held manufacturers of semiconductors, resistors, capacitors, and other electronic components.
103730_13_ITEM5_P6_S2	Management believes that the product offerings of the companies contained in the peer group are more similar to our product offerings than those of the companies contained in any published industry index.
103730_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	The return of each peer issuer has been weighted according to the respective issuer's stock market capitalization.
103730_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	The line graph assumes that $100 had been invested at December 31, 2007 and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
103730_13_ITEM5_P7_S2	The cash equivalent of the shares received in the spin-off of VPG are included in Vishay's results below.

103730_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.08 effect on earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM6_P1_S3	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Includes the results of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric from September 28, 2011.

103730_13_ITEM6_P2_S4	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(5) Includes the results of Vishay Transducers India Limited from June 30, 2008, of Powertron GmbH from July 23, 2008, and of the wet tantalum business of KEMET Corporation from September 15, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	Also includes net pretax charges of $1,796,298,000 for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, terminated tender offer expenses, and losses on adverse purchase commitments, partially offset by a gain on sale of a building.
103730_13_ITEM6_P3_S2	Also includes additional tax expenses for one-time tax items totaling $36,935,000.
103730_13_ITEM6_P3_S3	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a negative $9.49 effect on earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM6_P3_S4	VPG contributed $241,700,000 of net revenues, $(68,426,000) of loss before taxes, $(74,130,000) of net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders, and $(0.39) per share attributable to Vishay stockholders to our results in 2008.
103730_13_ITEM6_P3_S5	VPG represented $93,465,000 of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as businesses that have been spun off, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, inventory write-downs and write-offs, gains or losses on purchase commitments, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Discrete semiconductors and passive components manufactured by Vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronic products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and our Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its results of operations and cash flows are included in the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Prior to the completion of the spin-off of VPG, we operated in six product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, Capacitors, and Vishay Precision Group.
103730_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Following the spin-off we operate in five product segments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we completed the repurchase of 13.9 million shares of our common stock for $150 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Including this most recent repurchase, we have repurchased 44.3 million shares of our common stock since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, representing 24% of our shares outstanding before we began this initiative.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	Beginning in 2012, the permitted capacity to repurchase shares of stock under our credit facility began to increase each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	At December 31, 2012, our total capacity to repurchase shares of stock under our credit facility was $174.5 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	Although we have no current plans, we will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	We continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1.
103730_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Both 2011 and 2012 were characterized by stronger first halves and weaker second halves.
103730_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	The first half of 2011 was stronger than the first half of 2012, which resulted in a reduction of nearly all key financial metrics compared with the prior year.
103730_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $2.230 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.594 billion and $2.725 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $122.7 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $238.8 million, or $1.42 per share, and $359.1 million, or $1.89 per share, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 include items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliation below.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), including adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share do not have uniform definitions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_13_ITEM7_P10_S6	Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations.
103730_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2012 represent the effects of a deteriorating business environment in most of our markets that began in the third fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	This period of business environment deterioration followed a period of improvement in the business environment experienced in the first six fiscal months of 2012 compared to the last six fiscal months of 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	We believe that the business environment in most of our markets is being negatively impacted by macroeconomic anxiety that has started to influence the end consumers and the supply chain.
103730_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our results for 2012 demonstrate our ability to react quickly to changing economic environments and successfully implement temporary cost reduction measures when necessary to sustain earnings.
103730_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Despite the relatively low revenues, our pre-tax results were as we would expect based on our business model.
103730_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 were also affected by macroeconomic concerns, which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year.
103730_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	This period of macroeconomic concern followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of 2011 in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession at the same sales volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010 represent a period of favorable business conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	We also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices ("ASP").
103730_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	We analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	(1) Operating margin for the second fiscal quarter of 2012 includes a $12.2 million gain recognized on the sale of a vacated property in Belgium (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	(2) End-of-period backlog for the first fiscal quarter of 2012 reflects a total of $12.2 million related to the backlog of HiRel Sytems LLC as of the date of acquisition.
103730_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	See "Financial Metrics by Segment" below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Like many of the companies in our industry, our results for the second half, and in particular, the fourth fiscal quarter, of 2012 were impacted by low demand from distributors which led to a further reduction in revenues compared to the prior fiscal quarters.
103730_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The low distributor demand, deteriorating business environment in most of our markets, and macroeconomic anxieties that affected end consumers and the supply chain has resulted in a decrease in the backlog.
103730_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The low distributor inventory levels in the supply chain and continued strength of the automotive market resulted in an increase in distributor orders and, as a result, the book-to-bill ratio, in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	Competitive pricing pressure for commodity products has resulted in the continued decline of average selling prices versus the prior quarter and prior year periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Lower sales volume led to a reduction in gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter versus the prior year period and the previous fiscal quarters.
103730_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Due to the increase in orders, the book-to-bill ratio increased to 0.95 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 from 0.87 in the third fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 1.00 and 0.90, respectively, versus ratios of 0.79 and 0.94, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our existing product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA").
103730_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay's four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period .
103730_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, an average of approximately $100 million of revenues per year.
103730_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions larger than $500 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	On January 13, 2012, we acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for approximately $85.5 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired will further enhance our inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from January 13, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	On September 28, 2011, we acquired the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric, Inc., for approximately $19.3 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The businesses acquired will further enhance our broad resistor portfolio, particularly in the high power and high current ranges, as well as with resistor assemblies for industrial applications.
103730_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for these businesses have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from September 28, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	On July 6, 2010, we completed the spin-off of our measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and our Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Upon completion of the spin-off, certain executive officers received bonuses aggregating approximately $2.1 million, which is reflected in the results for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows are included in the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	The product lines that comprise VPG are included in the VPG reporting segment.
103730_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the effect that VPG had on our consolidated results.
103730_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products, particularly our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry and inflation drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Our variable cost reduction efforts include expending capital to increase automation and maximize the efficiency in our production facilities, consolidating materials purchasing across regions and divisions to achieve economies of scale, materials substitution, maintaining an appropriate mix of in-house production and subcontractor production, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	We seek to maintain selling, general, and administrative expenses at current quarterly levels, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Our fixed cost control efforts include automating administrative processes through the expansion of IT systems, gradually migrating to common IT systems across our organization, streamlining our legal entity structure, and reducing our external resource needs by utilizing more cost-effective in-house personnel, while utilizing external resources when day-to-day expertise is not required in-house.
103730_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Between 2001 and 2009, we recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs totaling $320 million and related asset write-downs totaling $89 million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward.
103730_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	We also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	We believe that our workforce is now appropriately located to serve our customers, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	We did not initiate any new restructuring projects in 2010 - 2012 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during such periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Because we believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, we do not anticipate any material restructuring expenses in 2013.
103730_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We currently plan to keep our trained workforce even at lower manufacturing activity levels by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	However, the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	We have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to our acquisitions of Huntington Electric and HiRel Systems, LLC, but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Even as we seek to manage our costs, we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
103730_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock.
103730_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	We plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	To foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by 15% since 2009 and plan to further increase it; we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities; and we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase the design-in of our products in local markets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	Our growth plan also targets adding, through acquisitions, $100 million of revenues per year on average.
103730_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	Since 2011, we have acquired the specialty product businesses of Huntington Electric and HiRel Systems, LLC and we continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities despite the current economic volatility.
103730_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	While we have in the past used forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures, we generally have not done so in recent periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the "functional currency" of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	A subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company's operations generally would have the parent company's currency as its functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	The dollar generally was stronger in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus the comparable prior year periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	These subsidiaries incur gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency, especially in periods of rapidly changing foreign currency exchange rates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The sudden rapid changes in the Euro exchange rates experienced in 2012 resulted in modest transactional losses.
103730_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 have been slightly favorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk.
103730_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_13_ITEM7_P63_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	We recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	We earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees' periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by our management that we believe are reasonable.
103730_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	However, it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	If we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is not required.
103730_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is required.
103730_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	In the first step of the quantitative impairment test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	The comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are generally the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance graph in Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
103730_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	In step two of the quantitative impairment test, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired those business units.
103730_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Specifically, we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
103730_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two.
103730_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Fair value of reporting units, and the underlying assets and liabilities of those reporting units, is measured at a point in time, and reflects specific market conditions as of the measurement date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	We perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	We assess the impairment of our long-lived assets, other than goodwill and tradenames, including property and equipment, long-term prepaid assets, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
103730_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and evaluated as a group.
103730_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets, changes in historical or projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends.
103730_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group, primarily determined using discounted future cash flows.
103730_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (which for us are comprised entirely of tradenames) are not amortized, but similar to goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	These tests are performed more frequently if there are triggering events.
103730_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	When testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset.
103730_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	If we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired, we would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset.
103730_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	As of December 31, 2012, one customer comprised 14.7% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	This customer comprised 10.9% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2012 or December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for certain postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_13_ITEM7_P88_S4	We use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P88_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Plans in these countries comprise approximately 95% of our retirement obligations at December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Within the U.S., we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk.
103730_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	We expect net periodic pension cost in 2013 to approximate net period pension cost recognized in 2012, with an increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses offset by lower interest cost due to lower discount rates.
103730_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions will be required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Accordingly, net periodic pension cost for U.S. plans no longer include any service cost.
103730_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
103730_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	These accruals are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.
103730_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	We and our subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as income tax returns in multiple U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examinations of our U.S. federal tax returns for all tax years through 2002.
103730_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	Because of net operating losses, which were fully utilized on the 2010 tax return, our U.S. federal tax return for 2003 and subsequent years remain subject to examination.
103730_13_ITEM7_P100_S3	Examinations of most principal subsidiaries in Israel through the 2007 tax year were concluded in 2010, and these principal subsidiaries are currently under audit for tax years 2008 through 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P100_S4	The tax returns of other significant non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently under examination in Germany (2005 through 2008), India (2004 through 2009), China (2007 through 2011), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2006 through 2011).
103730_13_ITEM7_P100_S5	We and our subsidiaries are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	We account for uncertainty in income tax positions using the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as prescribed in GAAP.
103730_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be "more likely than not" to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
103730_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Substantially all earnings generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Statement of operations' captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our revenue results for the year ended December 31, 2012 were negatively affected by the reduced demand for our products that we began to experience in the last six fiscal months of 2011, which significantly reduced our backlog, and the deterioration of the business environment of most of our markets in the last six fiscal months of 2012 following an improving business environment in the first six fiscal months of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	Our cost management and the adaptation of our manufacturing capacities enabled us to sustain earnings at the lower sales volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	Our revenue results for the year ended December 31, 2011 represent the effects of macroeconomic concerns, which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year, and the resulting quick adaptation of our manufacturing capacities in response thereto.
103730_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	This period of macroeconomic concerns followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of the year in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession at the same sales volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The recovery of our business and revenues that we began experiencing in the second half of 2009 continued throughout 2010 due to historically high overall demand for electronic components and a favorable pricing environment.
103730_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_13_ITEM7_P110_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $72.7 million, $80.3 million, and $71.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.2%, 3.0%, and 2.6%, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P110_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were approximately $76.9 million, $82.3 million, and $60.9 million, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P110_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $7.1 million, $6.6 million, and $5.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2012 were 23.6%, as compared to 27.8% for year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	This decrease in gross profit margin reflects significantly lower volume and lower average selling prices.
103730_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 27.8%, as compared to 29.6% for year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	The gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 29.4% excluding VPG.
103730_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	This decrease in gross profit margin reflects lower volume and slightly higher materials prices.
103730_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the MOSFETs segment was as follows:
103730_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	The MOSFETs segment has been negatively affected by the low demand from distributors in Asia.
103730_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to decreases in sales volume and average selling prices.
103730_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	Also, a non-recurring manufacturing issue associated with purchased materials affected the 2012 results.
103730_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	The MOSFETs segment was the segment most adversely affected by the decreased demand for consumer goods and the reduction in distribution orders in the second half of 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 reflects significantly lower volume and average selling prices from the historically high prices of 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	We have experienced a significant decline in average selling prices versus the prior years.
103730_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	The decline in 2012 is partially due to selective volume based pricing for our MOSFETs products that we implemented in the second fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Customer qualification of next generation high voltage MOSFETs is currently on-going.
103730_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	These new and innovative products have received a good reception by the market thus far.
103730_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	We continue to make capital and R D investments in this business.
103730_13_ITEM7_P121_S3	Accordingly, while the current environment is challenging, we are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the MOSFETs segment.
103730_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Diodes segment was as follows:
103730_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	The Diodes segment has been negatively affected by the low demand from distributors in Asia.
103730_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The decrease in the Diodes segment gross profit margin from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	The increase in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased average selling prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	After a period of increasing average selling prices in 2010 and early 2011, typical pricing pressure for our established Diodes products has returned.
103730_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	We have experienced a moderate price decline in 2012 versus 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	Average selling prices were moderately higher in 2011 versus 2010 due to the higher average selling prices in the first six fiscal months of 2011 versus 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Optoelectronic Components segment was as follows:
103730_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment has been relatively stable due to the continued strong demand of the automotive and industrial markets despite being negatively affected by the low demand from distributors in Asia.
103730_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	The segment gross profit margin remained high despite a decrease in sales volume and average selling prices in 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment was adversely affected by the decreased demand for consumer goods in the second half of 2011, but benefited from strong demand from the automotive and industrial markets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	Despite some fluctuations in demand, gross profit margin remained relatively steady in 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P131_S2	The slight decrease in gross profit margin versus 2010 is primarily due to a reduction from historically high average selling prices versus the prior periods.
103730_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	After a period of historically high average selling prices in 2010, typical pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products has returned.
103730_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Resistors Inductors segment was as follows:
103730_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	The Resistors Inductors segment has been negatively affected by a slowing of demand in Europe.
103730_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	The segment gross profit margin remained high, but decreased slightly from 2011 to 2012 due to decreases in sales volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	The Resistors Inductors segment was adversely affected by the economic slowdown in the second half of 2011, but continued to produce strong results.
103730_13_ITEM7_P136_S3	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to a slight decrease in volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	We further enhanced the segment's product portfolio in 2012 by acquiring HiRel Systems.
103730_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	Specifically, HiRel Systems expands our magnetic and power conversion specialty product portfolio.
103730_13_ITEM7_P137_S2	The integration of Huntington Electric, acquired in the third fiscal quarter of 2011, and HiRel Systems continues as planned.
103730_13_ITEM7_P137_S3	Our results for 2012 were positively impacted by the acquisitions of Huntington Electric and HiRel Systems and we expect HiRel Systems' revenue growth to out-perform our corporate average.
103730_13_ITEM7_P137_S4	More opportunities for acquisitions exist and are being evaluated.
103730_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Average selling prices declined slightly from 2011 to 2012 partially due to unfavorable customer mix.
103730_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	Average selling prices remained relatively consistent from 2010 to 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Capacitors segment was as follows:
103730_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Capacitors segment was negatively affected by the economic slow-down in the second half of 2012 and a reduction in demand for renewable energies.
103730_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and some temporary inefficiencies.
103730_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	The Capacitors segment was adversely affected by high distributor inventory levels in the second half of 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P143_S1	The increase in gross profit margin from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to increased average selling prices, which more than offset the lower volume.
103730_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	Average selling prices have remained relatively stable, substantially higher than 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	We completed the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	Net revenues and gross margin percentage for the periods that VPG was included in our consolidated results were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	The overall decrease in SG A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2012 versus the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to cost containment initiatives and certain temporary cost reduction programs, lower bonus accruals for 2012, and a positive exchange rate impact, partially offset by SG A expenses of acquired businesses.
103730_13_ITEM7_P147_S1	The increase in SG A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P147_S2	VPG accounted for $35.4 million (including $8.4 million of costs associated with the spin-off) of SG A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P147_S3	The overall increase in SG A expenses, excluding VPG, in the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to foreign currency effects.
103730_13_ITEM7_P147_S4	The increase in SG A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues.
103730_13_ITEM7_P147_S5	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	The acquisitions of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in the third fiscal quarter of 2011 and HiRel Systems LLC in the first fiscal quarter of 2012 increased our amortizable intangible assets balance by $51.1 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for an estimate of our annual amortization expense through 2017.
103730_13_ITEM7_P148_S2	Additional acquisition activity will increase these amounts.
103730_13_ITEM7_P148_S3	Amortization expense remained stable in 2012 versus 2011 principally due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, which was offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the aforementioned acquisitions in the third fiscal quarter of 2011 and first fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	The decrease in amortization expense in 2011 versus 2010 is principally due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the aforementioned acquisition of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in the third fiscal quarter of 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	We also recorded a $12.2 million gain on the sale of vacated property in Belgium in the second fiscal quarter of 2012 that is reported on a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $3.3 million versus the year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P151_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2041 and due 2042 that were issued on May 13, 2011 and May 31, 2012, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold ancillary investments in the equity of two companies located outside of the U.S. for a total gain of $1.4 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	The increase in interest income in 2011 is primarily due to the interest earned on the short-term investments purchased in 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	The decrease in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2012 versus the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to lower interest rates on the short-term investments in 2012 versus 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $8.2 million versus the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 that were issued on November 9, 2010 and May 13, 2011, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $1.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt equal to the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a revolving credit commitment and term loan at the date of termination.
103730_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	The increase in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the interest earned on the short-term investments purchased in 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the effective tax rates were 27.4%, 27.5%, and 11.2%, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P159_S1	The effective tax rates are less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
103730_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_13_ITEM7_P160_S1	These items total $(4.0) million (tax benefit), $3.5 million, and $(59.5) million (tax benefit) in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P160_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Israel due to a merger of several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel in the fourth fiscal quarter which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone.
103730_13_ITEM7_P160_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the discrete items included a $10.0 million expense for the effect of a tax rate change on deferred taxes in Israel recorded in the first fiscal quarter, reduced by $1.0 million for a 2010 tax return filing in the fourth fiscal quarter, and partially offset by benefits related to reductions of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions of $5.5 million recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_13_ITEM7_P160_S4	The reductions of valuation allowances were principally in Belgium due to expected future income from a pending real estate sale.
103730_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	The discrete items for the year ended December 31, 2010 were recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter and related primarily to the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and Israel.
103730_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_13_ITEM7_P162_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_13_ITEM7_P162_S2	Part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_13_ITEM7_P162_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate.
103730_13_ITEM7_P162_S4	Changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_13_ITEM7_P164_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy and to reduce debt levels.
103730_13_ITEM7_P164_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 11 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 18 years.
103730_13_ITEM7_P164_S3	A portion of the cash flows from operations was generated by VPG which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as "free cash," a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_13_ITEM7_P165_S1	Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 16 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 11 years.
103730_13_ITEM7_P165_S2	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash in line with our history despite the difficult economic environment during the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	Beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company's capital structure.
103730_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	On May 31, 2012, we completed the offering of $150 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior debentures due 2042 to qualified institutional investors.
103730_13_ITEM7_P167_S2	We used the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to repurchase 13,948,687 shares of common stock at $10.75 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P167_S3	We believe that the use of low-coupon, long-dated convertible debentures was a more efficient means to finance the repurchase versus repatriation of non-U.S. cash.
103730_13_ITEM7_P167_S4	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	Including the most recent issuance of convertible debentures described above, we have completed three issuances of low-coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance.
103730_13_ITEM7_P168_S1	We utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase 44.3 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 24% of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	Substantially all of our December 31, 2012 cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S1	During the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we repatriated $72.1 million of cash to the U.S., which substantially completed the $112.5 million cash repatriation program we initiated in 2008.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S2	This repatriated cash was used to reduce the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S3	Following this reduction in the amount outstanding under the facility, the carrying value of our long-term debt is approximately the same as the carrying value of debt prior to the May 2012 issuance of the convertible debentures due 2042.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S4	The tax effect of this repatriation was recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S5	At the present time, we expect the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_13_ITEM7_P169_S6	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, w e would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	We also entered into a new, larger, revolving credit facility in December 2010, which has been favorably amended at minimal cost.
103730_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	On April 3, 2012, we amended our credit agreement and entered into an incremental facility agreement that increases the total revolving commitment from $450 million to $528 million.
103730_13_ITEM7_P170_S2	The incremental commitments provide us with additional flexibility to pursue our growth plan.
103730_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	The incremental revolving commitments have terms and conditions identical to the terms and conditions of the existing commitments under the credit facility.
103730_13_ITEM7_P171_S1	Other significant terms and conditions of the credit agreement have not been changed.
103730_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	Following the expansion, we have the ability to request up to an additional $22 million of incremental commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $89 million and $155 million, respectively, was outstanding under the credit facility.
103730_13_ITEM7_P172_S2	The credit facility provides a revolving commitment through December 1, 2015.
103730_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
103730_13_ITEM7_P173_S2	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.95%.
103730_13_ITEM7_P173_S3	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.00 to 1 and will decrease if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_13_ITEM7_P173_S4	We are also required to pay facility commitment fees of 0.35% per annum on the entire commitment amount.
103730_13_ITEM7_P173_S5	Such facility commitment fees will increase if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1.
103730_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets located in the United States, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, and bank and securities accounts) of Vishay and certain significant domestic subsidiaries, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_13_ITEM7_P174_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay.
103730_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	The credit facility includes limits or restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, repurchasing our common stock, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P175_S1	The credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_13_ITEM7_P176_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article 6 of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 1, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	We were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 10.38 to 1 and 1.90 to 1, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM7_P177_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	Beginning in 2012, our permitted capacity to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock under the credit facility began to increase each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	At December 31, 2012, our credit facility allowed us to repurchase up to $174.5 million of our common stock.
103730_13_ITEM7_P179_S2	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	In 2011, we began investing a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
103730_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	At December 31, 2012, the interest rates on our short-term investments average 0.9% and are approximately 60 basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_13_ITEM7_P181_S1	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	Measurements such as "free cash" and "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_13_ITEM7_P184_S1	Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM7_P184_S2	However, management believes that "free cash" is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends, and that an analysis of "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_13_ITEM7_P184_S3	These measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	The balance of our revolving credit facility was $89 million at December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	We borrowed $128 million and repaid $194 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $123.6 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $160 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	Management expects to continue to maintain the outstanding balance on the credit facility around its current level, and may periodically pay down the balance with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_13_ITEM7_P186_S2	Acquisition activity or share repurchases may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2012 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.3 to 1, as compared to 4.2 to 1 as of December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	The slight increase is primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable and other accrued expenses in 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P187_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity was 0.24 to 1 at December 31, 2012 as compared to a ratio of 0.25 to 1 at December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P187_S3	This slight decrease is primarily due to the net repayment of $66 million on our credit facility in 2012 partially offset by the carrying amount of the convertible senior debentures due 2042 issued in the second fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $287.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $376.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P188_S1	This decrease is principally due to $116.5 million less net earnings generated in 2012, partially offset by changes in working capital.
103730_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $150.3 million, as compared to $168.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7_P189_S1	We expect capital spending of approximately $165 million in 2013.
103730_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	As of December 31, 2012 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement, one of which bears a maturity date of 2102, and include commitment fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on December 1, 2015.
103730_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042.
103730_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P193_S1	Among other things, approximately $670 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock at the option of the holder.
103730_13_ITEM7_P193_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_13_ITEM7_P193_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our variable-rate exchangeable notes due 2102 and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2012, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 includes approximately $60.3 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	We expect to pay $9.1 million of the liabilities in 2013 due to the settlement of tax audits.
103730_13_ITEM7_P194_S2	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM7_P194_S3	Accordingly, the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_13_ITEM7_P195_S2	See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_13_ITEM7_P195_S3	These obligations were not material to us as of December 31, 2012, and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above.
103730_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	We maintain long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	The purchase commitments in the table above represent the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these agreements and include commitments that arose subsequent to the balance sheet date due to amendments to the agreements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P196_S2	Our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	GAAP requires that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market prices.
103730_13_ITEM7_P197_S1	The purchase commitments for silicon wafers described above are for the manufacture of proprietary products using Vishay Siliconix-owned technology licensed to these subcontractors by Siliconix, and accordingly, management can only estimate the "market price" of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P197_S2	Management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices.
103730_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	Other long-term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and known obligations that arose subsequent to the balance sheet date.
103730_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	Other long-term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, on May 13, 2009, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with the late Dr. Felix Zandman, our founder and former Executive Chairman, Chief Technical and Business Development Officer.
103730_13_ITEM7_P199_S1	Pursuant to the amended and restated employment agreement, Dr. Zandman received $10 million upon signing the agreement and five additional annual payments of $10 million each, two of which remain to be paid to his estate as of December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P199_S2	Dr. Zandman's passing in June 2011 had no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, executive employment agreements, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM7_P201_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_13_ITEM7_P202_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_13_ITEM7_P202_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_13_ITEM7_P203_S0	See also "Commodity Price Risk" included in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional related information.
103730_13_ITEM7_P204_S0	As more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, new accounting guidance became effective for us in 2012.
103730_13_ITEM7_P204_S1	There is no effective accounting guidance pending adoption as of December 31, 2012 that is expected to have a material effect on our future financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM7_P205_S0	The adoption of the new guidance in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The exchangeable notes, of which $95 million are outstanding, bear interest at LIBOR (reset quarterly).
103730_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2012, we had $89 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.95%.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2012, we have $697.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $294.9 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2012, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $2.9 million.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Also see "Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S6	We also have a higher percentage of Euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S7	Therefore, when the Euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is increased.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P9_S8	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $4.1 million and $9.8 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P10_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P12_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P14_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P15_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P15_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P15_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P16_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_13_ITEM7A_P18_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $7.0 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.
103730_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1 of this report.

103730_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s management.
103730_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology Inc. at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
103730_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_13_ITEM15_P71_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology Inc. maintained in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 and our report dated February 20, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_13_ITEM15_P78_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_13_ITEM15_P78_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2012 through the date these financial statements were issued through the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
103730_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, "stock, ship and debit" credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_13_ITEM15_P82_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P82_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $7,131, $6,633 and $5,781 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in process research and development) aggregated $57,164, $55,809, and $50,968, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P86_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	Government grants received by certain subsidiaries, primarily in Israel, are recognized as income in accordance with the purpose of the specific contract and in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
103730_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	Grants recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold were $351, $483, and $543 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P87_S2	Deferred grant income included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $1,548 and $2,185 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	The grants are subject to certain conditions, including maintaining specified levels of employment for periods up to ten years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	Noncompliance with such conditions could result in the repayment of grants.
103730_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	However, management expects that the Company will comply with all terms and conditions of the grants.
103730_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_13_ITEM15_P90_S2	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P90_S3	If the Company's assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_13_ITEM15_P90_S4	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	At the present time, substantially all earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_13_ITEM15_P91_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P92_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $(24), $(93), and $(838) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P96_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P96_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.
103730_13_ITEM15_P96_S4	The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at December 31, 2012 was approximately $40,903.
103730_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense.
103730_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	Depreciation expense was $153,801, $165,022, and $169,724 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and administrative expenses).
103730_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	The required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Certain of the Company's tradenames have been assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	Capitalized software is amortized over periods of three to ten years, primarily included in costs of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P101_S3	Customer relationships are amortized over useful lives of five to twenty years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P101_S4	Noncompete agreements are amortized over periods of four to ten years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P101_S5	The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_13_ITEM15_P102_S2	If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not required.
103730_13_ITEM15_P102_S3	If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is required.
103730_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_13_ITEM15_P103_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets before performing a quantitative impairment test.
103730_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	There was no impairment identified through the annual impairment tests completed in 2012, 2011, or 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_13_ITEM15_P109_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_13_ITEM15_P109_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_13_ITEM15_P110_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	Other assets include investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11) and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_13_ITEM15_P111_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_13_ITEM15_P111_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until sold.
103730_13_ITEM15_P111_S4	At the time of sale the assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_13_ITEM15_P112_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_13_ITEM15_P114_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_13_ITEM15_P114_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_13_ITEM15_P114_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P115_S1	The Company has also in the past used financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion, but not all, of its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_13_ITEM15_P115_S2	The purpose of the Company's foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM15_P117_S2	The Company's operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P118_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_13_ITEM15_P122_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2012 and 2011 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers' liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	At December 31, 2012, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors' and officers' insurance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P126_S2	The captive insurance entity had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
103730_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	Restricted cash of $7,752 and $7,637 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P128_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	No. 2011-4, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
103730_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	The ASU generally aligns the principles for fair value measurements and the related disclosure requirements under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
103730_13_ITEM15_P131_S1	The updated guidance clarifies existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and requires additional disclosure requirements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P131_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P131_S3	Vishay adopted the ASU on January 1, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P131_S4	The adoption of the ASU had no effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-8, Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S1	Under the revised guidance, the Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S2	If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test would be required.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S3	The ASU does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units, nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S4	In addition, the ASU does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S5	The ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after January 1, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S6	Vishay adopted the ASU on January 1, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P132_S7	The adoption of the ASU had no effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P133_S1	Under the revised guidance, when testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment the Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset.
103730_13_ITEM15_P133_S2	If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired, the Company would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset.
103730_13_ITEM15_P133_S3	The ASU does not revise the requirement to test indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P133_S4	In addition, the ASU does not amend the requirement to test these assets for impairment between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances; however, it does revise the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in interim periods.
103730_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	Vishay early adopted the ASU for its annual period ending December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P134_S1	The adoption of the ASU had no effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	On January 13, 2012, Vishay acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for $85,493, net of cash acquired.
103730_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired further enhanced the Company's inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P137_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from January 13, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $43,950 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $25,815 related to this acquisition.
103730_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	The goodwill associated with this transaction is deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_13_ITEM15_P138_S3	The Company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with GAAP.
103730_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	On September 28, 2011, Vishay acquired the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric, Inc., for approximately $19,335, net of cash acquired.

103730_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	Spin-off of Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	On July 6, 2010, Vishay completed the spin-off of its measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to Vishay's stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	Vishay's common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and Vishay's Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_13_ITEM15_P143_S2	Upon completion of the spin-off certain executive officers received bonuses aggregating approximately $2,100, which are reflected in the results of the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its results of operations and cash flows are included in the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	The product lines that comprise VPG are included in the VPG reporting segment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P145_S1	See Note 15 for further information on the effect that VPG had on Vishay's consolidated results.
103730_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	However, two members of the VPG board of directors also serve on Vishay's board of directors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, on July 6, 2010, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P147_S2	None of the agreements are expected to have a material impact on Vishay's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term "Vishay" in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay's product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	Due to the common board members, transition services agreement, lease and supply agreements, and trademark license agreements with VPG, which, in the aggregate, represent significant continuing involvement, Vishay did not restate prior periods to present VPG as a discontinued operation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	In conjunction with the acquisition of the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation ("KEMET") on September 15, 2008, Vishay issued a three-year term loan of $15,000 to KEMET.
103730_13_ITEM15_P150_S1	On May 5, 2010, KEMET prepaid the entire principal amount of the term loan plus interest, which is reflected on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from investing activities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_13_ITEM15_P151_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_13_ITEM15_P151_S2	The required annual impairment test of goodwill is completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P151_S3	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_13_ITEM15_P151_S4	The Company's business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	Vishay recorded goodwill impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM15_P152_S1	Subsequent to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet until the acquisition of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric on September 28, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	The increase in net intangible assets from December 31, 2011 is mainly attributable to the acquisition of HiRel Systems LLC on January 13, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	The Company allocated $43,950 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P155_S2	Net intangible assets of $15,371 were transferred to VPG on July 6, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P155_S3	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $14,754, $14,684, and $19,817, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P155_S4	HiRel Systems LLC intangible assets accounted for $2,670 of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P155_S5	VPG intangible assets accounted for $1,466 of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2012 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Company places a strong emphasis on controlling its costs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Historically, the Company's primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_13_ITEM15_P158_S1	Between 2001 and 2009, the Company recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs and related asset write-downs in order to reduce its cost structure going forward.
103730_13_ITEM15_P158_S2	The Company also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company believes that its workforce is now appropriately located to serve its customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P159_S1	Accordingly, t he Company did not initiate any new restructuring projects in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance costs expenses in the years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P160_S0	On April 3, 2012, Vishay sold a property in Belgium vacated as a result of its restructuring activities in prior years for approximately $14,200.
103730_13_ITEM15_P160_S1	At closing, Vishay recognized a gain on the sale of the property of $12,153 within its statements of operations and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $3,406 within its statement of cash flows.
103730_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	The remaining proceeds will be reported as proceeds from the sale of property and equipment within the statements of cash flows as the cash is received over the next three years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P161_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and noncontrolling interests consists of the following components:
103730_13_ITEM15_P162_S0	Significant components of income taxes are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P163_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.
103730_13_ITEM15_P163_S1	Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Company makes significant judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets (principally net operating losses).
103730_13_ITEM15_P164_S1	The carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize these assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
103730_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax provision is as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P166_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_13_ITEM15_P166_S1	These items total $(4,036) (tax benefit), $3,486, and $(59,484) (tax benefit) in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P167_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Israel due to a merger of several of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel in the fourth fiscal quarter which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone.
103730_13_ITEM15_P167_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the discrete items included a $10,024 expense for the effect of a tax rate change on deferred taxes in Israel recorded in the first fiscal quarter, reduced by $984 for a 2010 tax return filing in the fourth fiscal quarter, and partially offset by benefits related to reductions of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions of $5,554 recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_13_ITEM15_P167_S2	The reductions of valuation allowances were principally in Belgium due to expected future income from a pending real estate sale.
103730_13_ITEM15_P168_S0	The discrete items for the year ended December 31, 2010 were recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter and related primarily to the release of valuation allowances in the U.S. and Israel.
103730_13_ITEM15_P169_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had the following significant net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes:
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S0	Approximately $70,449 of the carryforwards in Belgium resulted from the Company's acquisition of BCcomponents in 2002.
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S1	Valuation allowances of $23,946 and $23,502, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, have been recorded through goodwill for these acquired net operating losses.
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S2	Prior to the adoption of updated guidance in ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009, if tax benefits were recognized through the utilization of these acquired net operating losses, the benefits of such loss utilization were recorded as a reduction to goodwill.
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S3	After the adoption of the updated guidance on January 1, 2009, the benefits of such losses are recorded as a reduction of tax expense.
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S4	In 2012, 2011, and 2010, the tax benefit recognized through a reduction of acquisition-date valuation allowances recorded as a reduction of tax expense was $0, $4,299, and $567, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S5	The reduction in valuation allowances included pre-acquisition allowances for losses in Austria and Netherlands.
103730_13_ITEM15_P170_S6	As of December 31, 2011, pre-acquisition net operating losses in Netherlands expired, reducing the valuation allowances by $16,495.
103730_13_ITEM15_P171_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had the following significant tax credit carryforwards available:
103730_13_ITEM15_P172_S0	At December 31, 2012, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,607,402 of foreign earnings, which the Company continues to expect to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_13_ITEM15_P172_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P173_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	As of December 31, 2008, the Company recorded additional tax expense for an expected repatriation of $112,500 because such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
103730_13_ITEM15_P174_S1	During the third fiscal quarter of 2012, the Company repatriated $72,100 of cash to the U.S., which substantially completed the $112,500 cash repatriation program the Company initiated in 2008.
103730_13_ITEM15_P174_S2	This repatriated cash was used to reduce the amount outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.
103730_13_ITEM15_P174_S3	At the present time, the Company expects that the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.
103730_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	Net income taxes paid (refunded) were $46,611, $126,918, and $23,322 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P176_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P176_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_13_ITEM15_P177_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_13_ITEM15_P177_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P177_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_13_ITEM15_P178_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_13_ITEM15_P178_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_13_ITEM15_P178_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	Until the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, VPG was included in the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns and with the Company and/or certain of the Company's subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.
103730_13_ITEM15_P179_S1	In conjunction with the spin-off, the Company and VPG entered a tax matters agreement under which the Company generally will be liable for all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes attributable to VPG with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the distribution date except to the extent that VPG has a liability for such taxes on its books at the time of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P179_S2	The Company is also principally responsible for managing any income tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions for pre-spin-off periods.
103730_13_ITEM15_P179_S3	The Company has fully indemnified VPG of tax exposures arising prior to the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_13_ITEM15_P180_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $8,671 and $5,764, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P180_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company recognized $2,833, $3,795, and $1,081, respectively, in interest and penalties.
103730_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	The amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2012 that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate is $60,284.
103730_13_ITEM15_P182_S1	The current portion of unrecognized tax benefits, representing the amount the Company expects that the unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next year, principally due to settlements of tax audits in Germany, is $9,147.
103730_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as income tax returns in multiple U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P183_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examinations of Vishay's U.S. federal tax returns for all tax years through 2002.
103730_13_ITEM15_P183_S2	Because of net operating losses, which were fully utilized on the 2010 tax return, the Company's U.S. federal tax return for 2003 and subsequent years remain subject to examination.
103730_13_ITEM15_P183_S3	Examinations of most principal subsidiaries in Israel through the 2007 tax year were concluded in 2010, and these principal subsidiaries are currently under audit for tax years 2008 through 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P183_S4	The tax returns of other significant non-U.S. subsidiaries are currently under examination in Germany (2005 through 2008), India (2004 through 2009), China (2007 through 2011), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2006 through 2011).
103730_13_ITEM15_P183_S5	The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P184_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility").
103730_13_ITEM15_P185_S1	The Credit Facility became effective on December 1, 2010 and provides a revolving commitment through December 1, 2015.
103730_13_ITEM15_P185_S2	On April 3, 2012, the Company amended the Credit Facility and entered into an incremental facility agreement that increases the total revolving commitment from $450,000 to $528,000.
103730_13_ITEM15_P185_S3	Following the expansion, Vishay has the ability to request up to an additional $22,000 of incremental commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_13_ITEM15_P186_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on the Company's leverage ratio.
103730_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011 and through the second fiscal quarter of 2012, borrowings bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.65%.
103730_13_ITEM15_P187_S1	Since the beginning of the third fiscal quarter of 2012 and based on the Company's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.95%.
103730_13_ITEM15_P187_S2	The interest rate on the Company's borrowings will increase if the Company's leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.00 to 1 and will decrease if the Company's leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_13_ITEM15_P187_S3	Vishay is also required to pay facility commitment fees of 0.35% per annum on the entire commitment amount.
103730_13_ITEM15_P187_S4	Such facility commitment fees will increase if the Company's leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1.
103730_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets located in the United States, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, and bank and securities accounts) of Vishay and certain significant domestic subsidiaries, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P188_S1	Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P188_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay.
103730_13_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Credit Facility includes limits or restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, repurchasing common stock, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P189_S1	The credit facility also requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	On September 8, 2011, Vishay entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility that permits the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock up to a permitted capacity, conditioned upon Vishay maintaining (i) a pro forma leverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.00, (ii) a pro forma interest expense coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00, and (iii) $400,000 of available liquidity, as defined in the amendment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P190_S1	Beginning in 2012, the permitted capacity to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock under the Credit Facility began to increase each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_13_ITEM15_P190_S2	At December 31, 2012, the Credit Facility allows the Company to repurchase up to $174,548 of its common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P190_S3	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P191_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, Vishay's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there was $431,295 and $286,995, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.
103730_13_ITEM15_P192_S1	Letters of credit totaling $7,705 and $8,005 were outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P193_S0	Vishay currently has three issuances of convertible senior debentures outstanding with generally congruent terms.
103730_13_ITEM15_P193_S1	The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the three series of outstanding convertible senior debentures:
103730_13_ITEM15_P194_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_13_ITEM15_P194_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_13_ITEM15_P195_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P196_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company's estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P196_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances beginning ten years subsequent to issuance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P197_S0	Interest expense related to the debentures is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
103730_13_ITEM15_P198_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_13_ITEM15_P198_S1	None of these conditions had occurred as of December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P199_S0	The debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of Vishay's common stock or a combination thereof, at Vishay's option, at the conversion rate.
103730_13_ITEM15_P199_S1	At the direction of its Board of Directors, Vishay intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares.
103730_13_ITEM15_P199_S2	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "fundamental change" in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_13_ITEM15_P200_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to the respective call dates, except in connection with certain tax-related events.
103730_13_ITEM15_P200_S1	On or after the call date and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay's common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_13_ITEM15_P201_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_13_ITEM15_P201_S1	The notes are governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_13_ITEM15_P201_S2	The notes may be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, may be called by Vishay for similar consideration.
103730_13_ITEM15_P202_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes are deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_13_ITEM15_P203_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spin-off, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,042 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P203_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P204_S0	The notes are subject to a put and call agreement under which the holders may at any time put the notes to Vishay in exchange for 6,176,471 shares of Vishay's common stock in the aggregate, and Vishay may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.
103730_13_ITEM15_P204_S1	The put/call rate of the Vishay notes is $15.39 per share of common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P205_S0	The notes bear interest at LIBOR.
103730_13_ITEM15_P205_S1	Interest continues to be payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each calendar year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P205_S2	The interest rate could be further reduced to 50% of LIBOR if the price of Vishay's common stock is above $40.73 per share for thirty or more consecutive trading days.
103730_13_ITEM15_P206_S0	In 2003, Vishay sold $500,000 aggregate principal amount of 3-5/8% convertible subordinated notes due 2023.
103730_13_ITEM15_P206_S1	Holders of substantially all (99.6%) of the 3-5/8% notes exercised their option to require Vishay to repurchase their notes on August 1, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM15_P206_S2	The remaining notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $1,870, were redeemed at Vishay's option on August 1, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	In 2010, the Company repaid a $13,500 Israeli bank loan and the balance of a $90,000 term loan under a previous credit facility.
103730_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $18,200, which was substantially unused.
103730_13_ITEM15_P210_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $15,500, which was substantially unused.
103730_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	Interest paid was $16,578, $14,084, and $9,120 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
103730_13_ITEM15_P213_S0	The Company's Class B common stock carries ten votes per share while the common stock carries one vote per share.
103730_13_ITEM15_P213_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P213_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P213_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P214_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P214_S1	The Company's revolving credit facility currently prohibits the payment of cash dividends (see Note 6).
103730_13_ITEM15_P215_S0	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_13_ITEM15_P215_S1	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.
103730_13_ITEM15_P216_S0	On May 31, 2012, the Company repurchased 13,948,687 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000.
103730_13_ITEM15_P216_S1	The Company repurchased 8,620,689 shares of its common stock on May 13, 2011 for $150,000 and 21,721,959 shares of its common stock on November 9, 2010 for $275,000.
103730_13_ITEM15_P216_S2	At December 31, 2012, the Credit Facility allows the Company to repurchase up to $174,548 of its common stock, conditioned upon the Company maintaining specific pro forma financial ratios and a required minimum amount of available liquidity, as defined in the amendment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P216_S3	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P217_S0	The Company issued 8,823,529 warrants to acquire shares of Vishay common stock as part of the purchase price for the 2002 acquisition of BCcomponents.
103730_13_ITEM15_P217_S1	These warrants expired in December 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P218_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P219_S0	*The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are convertible into 19,809,103, 7,884,885, and 12,704,055 shares, respectively, of Vishay common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P220_S0	The Company has reserved the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_13_ITEM15_P221_S0	The caption "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:
103730_13_ITEM15_P222_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold ancillary investments in the equity of two companies located outside of the U.S. for a total gain of $1,396.
103730_13_ITEM15_P222_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a $1,659 loss on the early extinguishment of debt equal to the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a revolving credit commitment and term loan at the date of termination.
103730_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_13_ITEM15_P224_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay's proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_13_ITEM15_P226_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_13_ITEM15_P227_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_13_ITEM15_P227_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_13_ITEM15_P229_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_13_ITEM15_P230_S1	These include pension plans which are "qualified" under Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code, and "non-qualified" pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_13_ITEM15_P231_S0	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P232_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans include both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_13_ITEM15_P232_S1	The Company's principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_13_ITEM15_P232_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P233_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_13_ITEM15_P233_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM15_P233_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P233_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_13_ITEM15_P234_S0	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P235_S0	The Company's principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_13_ITEM15_P235_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_13_ITEM15_P236_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_13_ITEM15_P236_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_13_ITEM15_P236_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_13_ITEM15_P236_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P236_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $16,608 and $14,423 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P237_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_13_ITEM15_P237_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM15_P237_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P237_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_13_ITEM15_P238_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_13_ITEM15_P238_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_13_ITEM15_P239_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_13_ITEM15_P239_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_13_ITEM15_P239_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_13_ITEM15_P239_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_13_ITEM15_P239_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P239_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $4,833 and $5,445 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P240_S0	On June 16, 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul's and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman's employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_13_ITEM15_P240_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P240_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_13_ITEM15_P241_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_13_ITEM15_P241_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P242_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:
103730_13_ITEM15_P243_S0	The plan assets are stated at fair value.
103730_13_ITEM15_P243_S1	See Note 18 for further discussion of the valuation of the plan assets.

103730_13_ITEM15_P246_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the projected and accumulated benefit obligations:
103730_13_ITEM15_P247_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost:
103730_13_ITEM15_P248_S0	See Note 10 for the pretax, tax effect and after tax amounts included in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P248_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2013 is $20,100.
103730_13_ITEM15_P249_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_13_ITEM15_P250_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
103730_13_ITEM15_P251_S0	The plans' expected return on assets is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_13_ITEM15_P251_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P252_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S0	The Company's U.S. defined benefit plans are invested in diversified portfolios of public-market equity and fixed income securities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S1	Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and, in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S2	The target allocation has historically been approximately 60% invested in equity securities and 40% invested in fixed income securities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S3	The Company's non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S4	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S5	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S6	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P253_S7	See Note 18 for further information on the fair value of the plan assets by asset category.
103730_13_ITEM15_P254_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P255_S0	The Company anticipates making contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans of between $15,000 and $20,000 in 2013.
103730_13_ITEM15_P256_S0	The Company's anticipated 2013 contributions for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans will approximate the expected benefit payments disclosed above.
103730_13_ITEM15_P257_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_13_ITEM15_P257_S1	One of these plans was amended effective January 1, 2012, which reduced the benefit obligations of the Company.
103730_13_ITEM15_P257_S2	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P258_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into formal employment agreements with six of its executives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P258_S1	These employment agreements provide medical benefits for these executives and their surviving spouses for life, up to a stated maximum annual premium value per person.
103730_13_ITEM15_P258_S2	The Company subsequently entered into similar agreements with additional executives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P258_S3	These benefits are fully vested, and accordingly, the obligations represented prior service costs which will be amortized over the average remaining expected services period for these executives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P259_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and accrued benefit cost related to U.S. and non-U.S. non-pension defined benefit postretirement plans:

103730_13_ITEM15_P261_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_13_ITEM15_P262_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost:
103730_13_ITEM15_P263_S0	The estimated actuarial items for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2013 are not material and approximate the amounts amortized in 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P264_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_13_ITEM15_P265_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
103730_13_ITEM15_P266_S0	The impact of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation is not material.
103730_13_ITEM15_P267_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P268_S0	As the plans are unfunded, the Company's anticipated contributions for 2013 are equal to its estimated benefits payments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P269_S0	The Company participates in various other defined contribution and government-mandated retirement plans based on local law or custom.
103730_13_ITEM15_P269_S1	The Company periodically makes required contributions for certain of these plans, whereas other plans are unfunded retirement bonus plans which will be paid at the employee's retirement date.
103730_13_ITEM15_P269_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the consolidated balance sheets include $12,347 and $9,534, respectively, within accrued pension and other postretirement costs related to these plans.
103730_13_ITEM15_P270_S0	Many of the Company's U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, some of which provide for Company matching under various formulas.
103730_13_ITEM15_P270_S1	The Company's matching expense for the plans was $4,230, $4,985, and $5,399 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P270_S2	No material amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 related to unfunded 401(k) contributions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S0	Certain key employees participate in a deferred compensation plan.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, these employees could defer a portion of their compensation until retirement, or elect shorter deferral periods.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S2	The Company maintains a liability within other noncurrent liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets related to these deferrals.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S3	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund payments under this plan.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S4	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S5	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P271_S6	Assets held in trust related to the deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $12,310 and $11,830, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P272_S0	The Company is obligated to pay post-employment benefits to certain terminated employees related to acquisitions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P272_S1	The liabilities recorded for these obligations total $5,827 and $6,818 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P272_S2	Of these amounts, $1,498 and $1,823 are included in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, with the remaining amounts included in other noncurrent liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P273_S0	The Company has various stockholder-approved programs which allow for the grant of share-based compensation to officers, employees, and non-employee directors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P274_S0	The amount of compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
103730_13_ITEM15_P274_S1	The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
103730_13_ITEM15_P275_S0	The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs"), phantom stock units, and restricted stock based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P275_S1	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_13_ITEM15_P276_S0	The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense recognized:
103730_13_ITEM15_P277_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, as presented in the table above, includes the reversal, in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest on January 1, 2015 at the time it was determined that the performance-based vesting criteria was not expected to be achieved.
103730_13_ITEM15_P278_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, as presented in the table above, includes amounts associated with the acceleration of vesting of awards upon the passing of Vishay's former Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, Dr. Felix Zandman.
103730_13_ITEM15_P278_S1	The associated expense is reported as a component of the executive compensation charge reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P278_S2	In accordance with Dr. Zandman's employment agreement, 98,375 RSUs held by Dr. Zandman immediately vested and were contributed to his estate following his passing and 202,330 RSUs with performance-based vesting criteria will be contributed to his estate upon the Company's achievement of the performance-based criteria.
103730_13_ITEM15_P278_S3	Additionally, the vesting of 77,334 unvested stock options held by Dr. Zandman at the time of his passing was accelerated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P278_S4	These options have since expired unexercised.
103730_13_ITEM15_P279_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, as presented in the table above, also includes amounts associated with the acceleration of vesting and other modifications of awards upon the resignation of Vishay's former Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Lior Yahalomi.

103730_13_ITEM15_P284_S1	The amendment eliminated share recycling, so that on the exercise of an option where the exercise price is paid via the tender of previously-owned shares or pursuant to an "immaculate cashless exercise," the total "gross" number of option shares exercised is removed from the pool of shares available for future issuance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P284_S2	Similarly, shares withheld to pay income taxes in connection with the exercise of an option are also removed from the pool.
103730_13_ITEM15_P284_S3	The amendment also restricts re-pricing and cash repurchases of options without the prior approval of stockholders.
103730_13_ITEM15_P285_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company has reserved 1,140,000 shares of common stock for future grants of equity awards pursuant to the 2007 Program.

103730_13_ITEM15_P287_S1	On March 16, 2008, the stockholder approval for the 1998 Stock Option Program expired.
103730_13_ITEM15_P287_S2	While no additional options may be granted pursuant to this plan, at December 31, 2012, 99,000 options issued under the 1998 Program remain outstanding and may be exercised in future periods.

103730_13_ITEM15_P288_S1	As a result of the acquisition, each outstanding option to acquire General Semiconductor common stock became exercisable for shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P288_S2	Based on the conversion ratio in the acquisition of 0.563 of a Vishay share for each General Semiconductor share, the former General Semiconductor options become exercisable in the aggregate for 4,282,000 shares of Vishay common stock on the date of the acquisition.
103730_13_ITEM15_P288_S3	All such options were immediately vested and exercisable as a result of the merger but the terms of the options otherwise remained unchanged.
103730_13_ITEM15_P288_S4	As of November 2, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the acquisition, no options related to this plan were outstanding and no additional options may be granted from this plan.
103730_13_ITEM15_P289_S0	As a consequence of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, the exercise price of all stock options was reduced 9.48% and 259,000 make-up options were granted to reflect the loss of value to the option holders due to the decrease in the trading price of Vishay's common stock as result of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P289_S1	Additionally, approximately 102,000 stock options that were held by VPG employees expired.

103730_13_ITEM15_P291_S0	The weighted average exercise price of the stock options included in the line item "Adjustment due to VPG spin-off" is equal to the weighted average exercise price of such stock options prior to the spin-off, as reduced by the spin-off adjustment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P291_S1	The weighted average exercise price of stock options outstanding, vested and expected to vest, and exercisable as of December 31, 2010 also reflects the decrease in the exercise price as a result of the spin-off adjustment.

103730_13_ITEM15_P295_S0	The pretax aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the closing stock price on the last trading day of 2012 of $10.63 per share and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2012 is $0 because all outstanding options have exercise prices in excess of market value.
103730_13_ITEM15_P295_S1	This amount changes based on changes in the market value of the Company's common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P295_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 22,095 and 650,621 options, respectively, were exercised.

103730_13_ITEM15_P297_S0	The weighted average grant date fair value of the stock options included in the line item "Adjustment due to VPG spin-off" is equal to the weighted average grant date fair value of such stock options prior to the spin-off, as reduced by the spin-off adjustment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P297_S1	The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2010 also reflects the decrease in the grant date fair value as a result of the spin-off adjustment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P298_S0	Each RSU entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock when the RSU vests.
103730_13_ITEM15_P299_S0	As a consequence of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, approximately 60,000 make-up RSUs were granted to reflect the loss of value to the unit holders due to the decrease in the trading price of Vishay's common stock as result of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P299_S1	Additionally, approximately 5,000 RSUs that were held by VPG employees expired.

103730_13_ITEM15_P300_S1	The weighted average grant date fair value per unit of RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2010 also reflects the decrease in the grant date fair value as a result of the spin-off adjustment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P301_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for RSUs that are expected to vest.
103730_13_ITEM15_P301_S1	The performance vesting criteria of the RSUs granted in the year ended December 31, 2010 that contain performance-based vesting criteria have been adjusted by 10% to reflect the absence of VPG within Vishay's consolidated results.
103730_13_ITEM15_P301_S2	The Company expects the performance-based vesting criteria for the outstanding performance-based RSUs that are scheduled to vest on January 1, 2013 and 2014 to be achieved.
103730_13_ITEM15_P301_S3	The stock-based compensation expense recognized for 276,000 performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest on January 1, 2015 was reversed in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 at the time that it was determined that the performance-based vesting criteria was not expected to be achieved.

103730_13_ITEM15_P303_S0	In the event of (i) the termination of the executive's employment by the Company without cause, by the executive for "good reason," or as a result of death or disability, the executive's outstanding RSUs shall immediately vest and the outstanding performance-based RSUs shall vest on their normal vesting date to the extent applicable performance criteria are realized; and (ii) a change of control of Vishay, all of such executive's outstanding RSUs and performance-based RSUs shall immediately vest.
103730_13_ITEM15_P303_S1	In the event of voluntary termination by the executive (without "good reason") or termination for cause, the executive's outstanding RSUs and performance-based RSUs will be forfeited.
103730_13_ITEM15_P304_S0	The Company maintains a phantom stock plan for certain senior executives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P304_S1	The Phantom Stock Plan authorizes the grant of up to 300,000 phantom stock units to the extent provided for in the Company's employment agreements with such senior executives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P304_S2	Each phantom stock unit entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock at the individual's termination of employment or any other future date specified in the individual's employment agreement.
103730_13_ITEM15_P304_S3	The phantom stock units are fully vested at all times.
103730_13_ITEM15_P305_S0	If the Company declares dividends on its common stock, the dividend amounts with respect to the phantom stock units will be deemed reinvested in additional units of phantom stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P306_S0	The Board of Directors of the Company can amend or terminate the Phantom Stock Plan at any time, except that phantom stock units already granted to any individual cannot be adversely affected without the individual's consent.
103730_13_ITEM15_P306_S1	Furthermore, stockholder approval of an amendment is required if the amendment increases the number of units subject to the Phantom Stock Plan or otherwise materially amends the Phantom Stock Plan or if stockholder approval is otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules.
103730_13_ITEM15_P307_S0	If the Board of Directors does not terminate the Phantom Stock Plan, it will terminate when all phantom stock units have been awarded with respect to all 300,000 shares of common stock reserved for the Phantom Stock Plan.
103730_13_ITEM15_P308_S0	In accordance with the Phantom Stock Plan, following Dr. Zandman's passing, 43,667 phantom stock units held by Dr. Zandman's estate were redeemed as common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P308_S1	As a consequence of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, approximately 15,000 make-up phantom stock units were granted to reflect the loss of value to the unit holders due to the decrease in the trading price of Vishay's common stock as result of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P308_S2	Additionally, 38,667 phantom stock units held by a VPG employee were adjusted and redeemed as common stock on December 7, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P308_S3	The following table summarizes the Company's phantom stock units activity for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 (number of phantom stock units in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM15_P309_S0	The Company uses various leased facilities and equipment in its operations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P309_S1	In the normal course of business, operating leases are generally renewed or replaced by other leases.
103730_13_ITEM15_P309_S2	Certain operating leases include escalation clauses.
103730_13_ITEM15_P310_S0	Total rental expense under operating leases was $29,667, $26,351, and $28,194 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P310_S1	VPG accounted for $1,789 of rental expense for the year ended December 31, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P311_S0	Future minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P312_S0	The Company also has capital lease obligations of $39 at December 31, 2012.
103730_13_ITEM15_P313_S0	The Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials.
103730_13_ITEM15_P313_S1	The Company's manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P314_S0	Complying with current laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.
103730_13_ITEM15_P315_S0	The Company has engaged environmental consultants and attorneys to assist management in evaluating potential liabilities related to environmental matters.
103730_13_ITEM15_P315_S1	Management assesses the input from these consultants along with other information known to the Company in its effort to continually monitor these potential liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P315_S2	Such assessments include the Company's share of remediation costs, information known to the Company concerning the size of the hazardous waste sites, their years of operation, and the number of past users and their financial viability.
103730_13_ITEM15_P316_S0	The Company has accrued environmental liabilities of $14,964 as of December 31, 2012 relating to environmental matters related to its General Semiconductor subsidiary.
103730_13_ITEM15_P316_S1	The Company has also accrued approximately $9,609 at December 31, 2012 for other environmental matters.
103730_13_ITEM15_P316_S2	The liabilities recorded for these matters total $24,573, of which $11,650 is included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, and $12,923 is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_13_ITEM15_P317_S0	While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined, management does not believe that the final disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows beyond the amounts previously provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P318_S0	The Company's present and past facilities have been in operation for many years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P318_S1	These facilities have used substances and have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous.
103730_13_ITEM15_P318_S2	Therefore, it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future, which the Company cannot now predict.
103730_13_ITEM15_P319_S0	The Company is a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.
103730_13_ITEM15_P319_S1	The Company is of the opinion that these litigations or claims will not have a material negative effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
103730_13_ITEM15_P320_S0	The Company's Siliconix subsidiary maintains long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P321_S0	Since 2004, Siliconix has maintained a definitive long-term foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with Tower Semiconductor, pursuant to which Siliconix transferred certain technology to Tower Semiconductor and committed to purchase a minimum amount of semiconductor wafers.
103730_13_ITEM15_P321_S1	Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company further amended its long-term foundry agreement with Tower Semiconductor.
103730_13_ITEM15_P321_S2	The agreement with Tower Semiconductor, as amended, extends through the fourth quarter of 2017.
103730_13_ITEM15_P322_S0	On July 6, 2012, Siliconix amended its foundry agreement with an Asian foundry to ensure additional capacity in exchange for cash and a commitment to purchase a minimum amount of semiconductor wafers.
103730_13_ITEM15_P322_S1	This agreement extends through the fourth quarter of 2016.
103730_13_ITEM15_P323_S0	The Company estimates its total purchase commitments under all long-term foundry agreements as follows:
103730_13_ITEM15_P324_S0	Siliconix has the option to purchase wafers from these subcontractors in addition to the minimum commitments and, accordingly, actual purchases may be different than the commitments disclosed above.
103730_13_ITEM15_P324_S1	Actual purchases from these subcontractors during the year ended December 31, 2012 were $36,419.
103730_13_ITEM15_P325_S0	The Company is a party to various product quality claims in the normal course of business.
103730_13_ITEM15_P325_S1	The Company provides warranties for its products which offer replacement of defective products.
103730_13_ITEM15_P325_S2	Annual warranty expenses are generally not significant.
103730_13_ITEM15_P326_S0	The Company periodically receives claims which arise from consequential damages which result from a customer's installation of an alleged defective Vishay component into the customer's product.
103730_13_ITEM15_P326_S1	Although not covered by its stated warranty, Vishay may occasionally reimburse the customer for these consequential damages in limited circumstances.
103730_13_ITEM15_P327_S0	The Company has employment agreements with certain of its senior executives.
103730_13_ITEM15_P327_S1	These employment agreements provide incremental compensation in the event of termination.
103730_13_ITEM15_P327_S2	The Company does not provide any severance or other benefits specifically upon a change in control.
103730_13_ITEM15_P328_S0	On May 13, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman (the "2009 Agreement").
103730_13_ITEM15_P328_S1	This agreement amended and restated the employment agreement between the Company and Dr. Zandman that was previously amended and restated as of January 1, 2004 (the "2004 Agreement").
103730_13_ITEM15_P329_S0	The purpose of the 2009 Agreement was to eliminate the right of Dr. Zandman to receive a royalty during the ten years following his termination of employment equal to 5% of gross sales, less returns and allowances, of Vishay products incorporating inventions and any other form of technology created, discovered or developed by him or under his direction.
103730_13_ITEM15_P329_S1	The royalty was payable in the event Dr. Zandman was terminated without "cause" or resigned for "good reason," as defined in the 2004 Agreement.
103730_13_ITEM15_P329_S2	This provision was carried over from Dr. Zandman's original employment agreement of March 1985, and could not be modified or eliminated without Dr. Zandman's consent.
103730_13_ITEM15_P329_S3	It was a reflection, among other things, of Dr. Zandman's key role in the founding of the Company and in creating, developing and commercializing the Company's technologies and the absence of any compensation to Dr. Zandman for the core intellectual property that he contributed to the Company over the years from its inception.
103730_13_ITEM15_P330_S0	The Company engaged a consultant in 2007 to assist its evaluation of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment to be terminated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P330_S1	Based in part upon the work of this consultant and management's own updated computations, management estimated that the present value of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment terminated at December 31, 2008 would have been between approximately $370,000 and $445,000, with a possible tax gross-up if the royalties were payable in connection with a change of control and deemed subject to an excise tax.
103730_13_ITEM15_P331_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Dr. Zandman's right to the royalty payments was terminated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P331_S1	Dr. Zandman received a payment of $10,000 as of the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, and his estate is entitled to receive annual payments of $10,000 each through 2014.
103730_13_ITEM15_P331_S2	Dr. Zandman's passing in June 2011 has no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P331_S3	The Company recognized the compensation expense equal to the present value of these payments in 2009.
103730_13_ITEM15_P331_S4	The Company recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge.
103730_13_ITEM15_P331_S5	At December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $9,731 and $10,000 accrued in other liabilities and other accrued expenses, respectively, for this liability.
103730_13_ITEM15_P332_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense of $3,889 reported as a component of the executive compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 for other elements of compensation that accelerated upon the passing of Dr. Zandman.
103730_13_ITEM15_P333_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense of $1,873 reported as a component of the executive compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 for elements of compensation payable to the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Lior Yahalomi, in connection with his resignation.
103730_13_ITEM15_P334_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of net revenues, a material portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P334_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_13_ITEM15_P334_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company's products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
103730_13_ITEM15_P335_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P335_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_13_ITEM15_P335_S2	As of December 31, 2012, one customer comprised 14.7% of the Company's accounts receivable balance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P335_S3	This customer comprised 10.9% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM15_P335_S4	No other customer comprised greater than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2012 or December 31, 2011.
103730_13_ITEM15_P336_S0	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_13_ITEM15_P336_S1	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P337_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P337_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_13_ITEM15_P337_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_13_ITEM15_P338_S0	Many of the Company's products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_13_ITEM15_P338_S1	The Company's consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_13_ITEM15_P338_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company's customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_13_ITEM15_P338_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net earnings.
103730_13_ITEM15_P339_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum.
103730_13_ITEM15_P340_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P340_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_13_ITEM15_P341_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_13_ITEM15_P341_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company's ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_13_ITEM15_P341_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company's ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company's products.
103730_13_ITEM15_P342_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_13_ITEM15_P342_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company's policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_13_ITEM15_P342_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P343_S0	Recently enacted rules in the U.S. on conflict minerals, which include tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold, all of which are used in the Company's products, could result in increased prices and decreased supply of conflict minerals, which could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P344_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 74% of revenues earned during 2012 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_13_ITEM15_P344_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, $974,323 of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_13_ITEM15_P344_S2	Some of the Company's products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_13_ITEM15_P344_S3	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_13_ITEM15_P344_S4	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_13_ITEM15_P345_S0	As of December 31, 2012 the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_13_ITEM15_P346_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 42 years.
103730_13_ITEM15_P346_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_13_ITEM15_P347_S0	Following the completion of the spin-off of VPG in the third fiscal quarter of 2010, Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_13_ITEM15_P348_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ("segment operating income").
103730_13_ITEM15_P348_S1	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_13_ITEM15_P348_S2	The Company's calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gains or losses on purchase commitments, and other items.
103730_13_ITEM15_P348_S3	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_13_ITEM15_P348_S4	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_13_ITEM15_P349_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_13_ITEM15_P350_S0	The Company has also disclosed certain additional items not used to evaluate segment performance.
103730_13_ITEM15_P350_S1	In some cases, the items are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are required to be disclosed by GAAP.
103730_13_ITEM15_P350_S2	Additionally, the additional segment disclosures may provide insight to the Company's future profitability by reportable segment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P351_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_13_ITEM15_P352_S0	Until July 6, 2010, VPG was part of Vishay and its assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows are included in the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_13_ITEM15_P352_S1	Excluding the non-recurring costs of the spin-off incurred by Vishay, VPG contributed $9,716 of income before taxes, $5,811 of net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders, and $0.03 per diluted share attributable to Vishay stockholders to Vishay's 2010 results.
103730_13_ITEM15_P353_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_13_ITEM15_P354_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, Vishay made changes to its business model to streamline its sales process such that three main subsidiaries generate the majority of third-party sales.
103730_13_ITEM15_P355_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_13_ITEM15_P356_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_13_ITEM15_P356_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), warrants (see Note 7), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P357_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM15_P358_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_13_ITEM15_P359_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_13_ITEM15_P360_S0	The Company's convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_13_ITEM15_P360_S1	While none of these events has occurred as of December 31, 2012, certain conditions which could trigger conversion have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_13_ITEM15_P361_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_13_ITEM15_P361_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the "treasury stock method" (similar to options and warrants) rather than the "if converted method" otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_13_ITEM15_P361_S2	Under the "treasury stock method," Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the notes based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_13_ITEM15_P361_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.88, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $19.02, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $11.81, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2042.
103730_13_ITEM15_P362_S0	As described in Note 6, the Company purchased 99.6% of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes due 2023 pursuant to the option of the holders to require the Company to repurchase their notes on August 1, 2008.
103730_13_ITEM15_P362_S1	The remaining notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $1,870, were redeemed at Vishay's option on August 1, 2010.
103730_13_ITEM15_P363_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_13_ITEM15_P364_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_13_ITEM15_P364_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_13_ITEM15_P364_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_13_ITEM15_P365_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_13_ITEM15_P366_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_13_ITEM15_P366_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_13_ITEM15_P367_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions.
103730_13_ITEM15_P368_S0	An asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_13_ITEM15_P369_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011:
103730_13_ITEM15_P370_S0	The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as "rabbi" trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans.
103730_13_ITEM15_P370_S1	Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale, and company-owned life insurance assets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P370_S2	The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.

103730_13_ITEM15_P373_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_13_ITEM15_P374_S0	The group annuity contract consists of a general asset account and a pooled separate account.
103730_13_ITEM15_P374_S1	Units of the general asset account are valued based on a discounted cash flow model using the current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations and similar credit risk.
103730_13_ITEM15_P374_S2	The pooled separate accounts are valued based on the value of the underlying bond funds, which are valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year, with adjustments made to reflect the nature of how the investment is held.
103730_13_ITEM15_P375_S0	The fair value measurement of the group annuity contract is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_13_ITEM15_P376_S0	The short-term investment fund strictly invests in short-term investments, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, U.S. government obligations, corporate notes, and funding agreements.
103730_13_ITEM15_P376_S1	The maturity date of all investments held by the short-term investment fund is within one year from the financial statement date.
103730_13_ITEM15_P376_S2	There are no redemption restrictions on the plan's investment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P377_S0	The fair value of the short-term investment fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investment.
103730_13_ITEM15_P377_S1	The fair value measurement of the short-term investment fund is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

103730_13_ITEM15_P381_S0	Cash held by the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consists of demand deposits on account in various financial institutions to fund current benefit payments.
103730_13_ITEM15_P381_S1	The carrying amount of the cash approximates its fair value.
103730_13_ITEM15_P382_S0	The Company holds available for sale investments in debt securities that are intended to fund a portion of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_13_ITEM15_P382_S1	The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_13_ITEM15_P382_S2	The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_13_ITEM15_P383_S0	The convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, issued by the Company on November 9, 2010, May 13, 2011, and May 31, 2012, respectively, contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period.
103730_13_ITEM15_P383_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_13_ITEM15_P384_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_13_ITEM15_P384_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company's current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures' credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_13_ITEM15_P384_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management's judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P385_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_13_ITEM15_P386_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is approximately $686,800 and $533,900, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability, of $391,628 and $398,068, respectively.
103730_13_ITEM15_P386_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P387_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
103730_13_ITEM15_P387_S1	The short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
103730_13_ITEM15_P387_S2	The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity.
103730_13_ITEM15_P388_S0	At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary.
103730_13_ITEM15_P388_S1	No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented.
103730_13_ITEM15_P388_S2	There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification.
103730_13_ITEM15_P388_S3	All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities' maturity dates.
103730_13_ITEM15_P389_S0	Interest on the securities is recognized as interest income when earned.
103730_13_ITEM15_P390_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, t he Company's cash and cash equivalents were comprised of demand deposits and time deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_13_ITEM15_P390_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs.
103730_13_ITEM15_P390_S2	Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_13_ITEM15_P391_S0	The Company's financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.
103730_13_ITEM15_P391_S1	The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values.
103730_13_ITEM15_P392_S0	(a) May not add due to differences in weighted average share counts.
103730_13_ITEM15_P393_S0	(b) The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday, except for the first fiscal quarter, which always begins on January 1, and the fourth fiscal quarter, which always ends on December 31.

103730_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	In the 1950's, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with a loan from the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	These products were included with the measurements and foil resistor businesses that we spun off into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("Vishay Precision Group" or "VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders on July 6, 2010.
103730_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	In the early 1990's, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay's global market position in passive components.
103730_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011; HiRel Systems in 2012; and MCB Industrie in 2013.
103730_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	In the late 1990's, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Vishay's next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay's acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We continue to implement the vision, strategy, and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman as we continue to work tirelessly to enhance value for our stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Vishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2143.

103730_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our broad product portfolio allows us to penetrate markets in all industry segments and all regions, which reduces our exposure to a particular end market or geographic location.
103730_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through improving market penetration by expanding manufacturing facilities for our most successful products, increasing technical resources, and developing markets for specialty products in Asia.
103730_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our net revenues for the following applicable periods were attributable to customers in the following regions:
103730_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The share of net revenues by end market was as follows:
103730_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Since 1985, we have expanded our product line through various strategic acquisitions, growing from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.
103730_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have successfully integrated the acquired companies within our existing management and operational structure, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales and administrative functions, creating manufacturing synergies, while improving customer service.
103730_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	We often target high margin niche business acquisitions, such as Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, and MCB Industrie, which we acquired in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM1_P15_S4	These acquisitions accounted for 3.4% of 2013 revenues and have margins above our corporate average.
103730_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 17 years and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 12 years.
103730_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures in prior periods and continued cost control activities (see "Cost Management" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") to contribute to our "free cash" generation going forward.
103730_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2013, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $787 million.
103730_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $640 million through August 8, 2018, of which $518 million was available as of December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong "free cash" flow generation provide financial strength and flexibility and reduce our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by fluctuating consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, modify existing products, respond to technological change, and customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have licenses to use, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
103730_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We plan to continue to use our research and development ("R D"), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	As part of our plan to foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by 18% since 2009 and plan to further increase it.
103730_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase the opportunities to design-in our products in local markets.
103730_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our success.
103730_14_ITEM1_P24_S4	We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop new innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products to make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends.
103730_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	We are directing increased funding and are focusing on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	We focus on controlling fixed costs and reducing variable costs.
103730_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	When our ongoing cost management activites are not adequate, we take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness including restructuring our business to realign our labor distribution.
103730_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We plan to continue to expand within the electronic components industry, through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product innovation, quality, and reliability, strong customer bases, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We maintain significant production facilities in those regions where we market the bulk of our products in order to enhance the service and responsiveness that we provide to our customers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	We aim to further strengthen our relationships with customers and strategic partners by providing broad product lines that allow us to provide "one-stop shop" service, whereby they can streamline their design and purchasing processes by ordering multiple types of products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our growth plan was designed based on the tenets of the key business strategies listed above.
103730_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	We design, manufacture, and market electronic components that cover a wide range of functions and technologies.
103730_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	We promote our ability to provide "one-stop shop" service to customers, whereby they can streamline their design and purchasing processes by ordering multiple types of products from Vishay.

103730_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	We aim to use this broad portfolio to increase opportunities to have our components selected and "designed in" to new end products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our products can be divided into two general classes: semiconductors and passive components.
103730_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Semiconductors are sometimes referred to as "active components" because they require power to function whereas passive components do not require power to function.
103730_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our semiconductor and passive components products are further categorized based on their functionality for financial reporting purposes.
103730_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on revenues, income, and total assets by segment.
103730_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our semiconductor products include MOSFETs, Diodes, and Optoelectronic Components.
103730_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Semiconductors are typically used to perform functions such as switching, amplifying, rectifying, routing, or transmitting electrical signals, power conversion, and power management.
103730_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our MOSFETs business includes both the commodity and non-commodity markets in which we believe that we enjoy a good reputation and strong brand recognition (Siliconix).

103730_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Passive components are used to store electrical charges, to limit or resist electrical current, and to help in filtering, surge suppression, measurement, timing, and tuning applications.
103730_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our Resistors and Inductors business is our original business.
103730_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	We maintain the broadest portfolio of resistor products worldwide.
103730_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	The business is solid, predictable, and growing at relatively stable selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	We are a market leader with a strong technology base, many specialty products, and strong brand recognition (such as our Dale, Draloric, Beyschlag, Sfernice, and HiRel Systems brands).
103730_14_ITEM1_P46_S4	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P46_S5	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current.
103730_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	They vary widely in precision and cost, and are manufactured from numerous materials and in many forms.
103730_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Linear resistive components are classified as variable or fixed, depending on whether or not their resistance is adjustable.
103730_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Non-linear resistors function by varying in resistance under influence of temperature (thermistors) or voltage (varistors).
103730_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	They can be used in temperature-measuring applications or as current or voltage-limiting devices.
103730_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We manufacture virtually all types of fixed resistors, both in discrete and network forms, as well as many variable types.
103730_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Vishay resistor innovations include Power Metal Strip technology.
103730_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	These resistors feature very low resistance and are used to measure changes in current flow (current sensing) or divert current flow (shunting).
103730_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Inductors use an internal magnetic field to change AC current phase and resist AC current.
103730_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Inductor applications include controlling AC current and voltage, filtering out unwanted electrical signals, and energy storage.
103730_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Vishay inductor innovations include IHLP low-profile, high-current inductor technology with industry-leading specifications, which is patented and generates royalty revenue.
103730_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	Our low-profile, high-current inductors save circuit board space and power in voltage regulator module ("VRM") and DC to DC converter applications.
103730_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	In addition, we are a worldwide leader in custom magnetic solutions focusing on high performance and high reliability.
103730_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	This field has been substantially strengthened, with the 2012 acquisition of HiRel Systems, broadening our portfolio, customer, and market segment reach.
103730_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our Capacitors business consists of a broad range of reliable, high-quality products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have a strong presence worldwide in specialty markets based on our product performance and reliability and strong brand recognition (including our Sprague, Vitramon, Roederstein, BCcomponents, and ESTA brands).
103730_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Capacitors are used in almost all electronic circuits.
103730_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	They store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Important applications for capacitors include electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies; decoupling and bypass of electronic signals for integrated circuits and circuit boards; and frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applications.
103730_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	We manufacture products based on all major capacitor technologies: tantalum (molded chip tantalum, coated chip tantalum, solid through-hole tantalum, and wet tantalum), ceramic (multilayer chip and ceramic disc), film, power, heavy-current, and aluminum electrolytic.
103730_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our capacitors range from tiny surface-mount devices for hearing aids and mobile devices to large power correction capacitors used in renewable energy, heavy industry, and electrical power grids.
103730_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	We are a recognized technology leader in many product ranges, securing our strong position in military and medical markets, and in a wide range of industrial and automotive applications.
103730_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our wet tantalum and MicroTan technologies are market leaders.
103730_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by United States government agencies, and under certain European military specifications.
103730_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product's classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed "dies" or "chips") on each wafer.
103730_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed "packages") that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel (see "Israeli Operations" below).
103730_14_ITEM1_P62_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Dominican Republic, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_14_ITEM1_P62_S5	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The majority of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification and others are actively pursuing such approval.
103730_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Certain materials, in addition to tantalum and including tin, tungsten, and gold are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers, the source for which may be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country.
103730_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	We are conducting due diligence on the source and custody of such materials.
103730_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the government's grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	The current benefits derived under these programs are not material to our consolidated results.
103730_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Because of our significant presence in Israel, the availability of these incentive programs could have a significant positive effect on us if we relocate manufacturing capacity or develop new product lines there.
103730_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	However, there are no substantial plans that would allow us to earn additional benefits.
103730_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	We could be materially adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	However, we have not experienced any material interruption in our Israeli operations during our 43 years of operations there, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_14_ITEM1_P78_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2013 is shown below:
103730_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers' specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating pricing and contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer's business requirements.
103730_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ("FAEs") to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers' engineering needs.
103730_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay "design-in" the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_14_ITEM1_P83_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_14_ITEM1_P83_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:
103730_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	MOSFETs: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, International Rectifier, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Diodes: Diodes Inc., Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics.
103730_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Optoelectronic Components: Avago, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors, Rohm, Sharp, Toshiba.
103730_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	Resistors and Inductors: KOA, Murata, Panasonic, Rohm, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	Capacitors: AVX, KEMET, Murata, Nichicon, Panasonic, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	There are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete.
103730_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability, technological innovation, business reputation, and price competitiveness.
103730_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People's Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_14_ITEM1_P96_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity's or individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_14_ITEM1_P106_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_14_ITEM1_P106_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_14_ITEM1_P107_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1_P107_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_14_ITEM1_P107_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_14_ITEM1_P107_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we employed approximately 22,500 full time employees, of whom approximately 89% were located outside the United States.
103730_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_14_ITEM1_P108_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_14_ITEM1_P110_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_14_ITEM1_P110_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_14_ITEM1_P110_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_14_ITEM1_P111_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and the periods of decline we recently experienced may resume and may become more pronounced.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	While we believe that a recovery from the recent global downturn is underway, there is no assurance that the recovery will continue at its current pace or at all, or that the conditions that contributed to the recent recessionary environment have in fact abated.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A decline in product demand on a global basis could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and will continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to achieve synergies, eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions, and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	On October 28, 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The programs primarily focus on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees Company-wide.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also plan to implement two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The expenses associated with the programs have been and will continue to be recorded as they become recognizable under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
103730_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are subject to various U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations that may affect our ability to complete certain acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, or we cannot effectively mitigate the assumed, contingent, and unknown liabilities acquired, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $365 million as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P28_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the period of economic slowdown.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately reflects the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 75% of our revenues during 2013 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 43 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We obtain substantial benefits by operating in Israel, but these benefits may not continue.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have substantial manufacturing operations in Israel, where we benefit from the Israeli government's grant and tax incentive programs.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These programs have contributed substantially, predominantly in previous years, to our growth and profitability.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	There can also be no assurance that in the future the Israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that, if it does, such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to benefit from them.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Any significant increase in the Israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the Israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Except for the distinct and targeted restructuring programs announced in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, we do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P61_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Approximately 98% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2013, $1,132 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	At the present time, we expect the cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	If cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	At December 31, 2013, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 47.3% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P66_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P66_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.4% of our Class B common stock, representing 42.4% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Some or all of our holders of Class B common stock may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P72_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	If the VPG spin-off transaction is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax could incur substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The VPG spin-off transaction was conditioned upon Vishay's receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and an opinion of tax counsel (the "Opinion") confirming that the VPG spin-off transaction should qualify as tax-free to us and our stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, and representations from us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' businesses and other matters.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Any inaccuracy in these facts, assumptions, or representations could invalidate the ruling, and we and our stockholders could be subject to substantial income tax liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and Opinion, the IRS or state or local tax authorities (collectively with the IRS, the "Tax Authorities") could determine on audit that the VPG spin-off transaction should be treated as a taxable transaction if the Tax Authorities determine that any of these facts, assumptions, or representations are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of our company or VPG after the spin-off.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Under the tax matters agreement between our company and VPG, VPG generally would be required to indemnify our company against its taxes resulting from the failure of the VPG spin-off transaction to qualify as tax-free ("Transaction Taxes") as a result of (i) any action by VPG or any of its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would reasonably be expected to prevent the spin-off from qualifying as a tax-free transaction to us and our stockholders (ii) any action by VPG or its affiliates following the completion of the spin-off that would be inconsistent with any material information or representation made in connection with the private letter ruling obtained by us from the IRS and/or with the Opinion or (iii) certain other actions taken by VPG.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	However, in the event that Transaction Taxes are incurred for any other reason, we would not be entitled to indemnification.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In addition, due to the potential impact of significant stock ownership changes on the taxability of the spin-off to us, we and VPG may determine not to enter into transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, such as issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs or acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities, if such issuances would exceed certain thresholds and such actions could be considered part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name .
103730_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the "Vishay" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the "Vishay" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.

103730_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2013, our business had 49 manufacturing locations.
103730_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.
103730_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some locations include both owned and leased facilities in the same location.
103730_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	The list of manufacturing facilities below excludes manufacturing facilities that are presently idle due to our restructuring activities.
103730_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment generally are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs.
103730_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	Owning many of our manufacturing facilities provides us meaningful financial and operating benefits, including long-term stability and a necessary buffer for economic downturns.
103730_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
103730_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The principal locations of our owned manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	The principal locations of our leased manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
103730_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	During the past few years, we settled several suits which we had initiated to enforce our intellectual property rights.
103730_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	We are receiving royalties on sales of these companies' products which use our technology.
103730_14_ITEM3_P2_S3	We are continuing to assert our legal rights against other parties which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights.
103730_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	In January 2005, an amended class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California on behalf of all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix against Vishay, Ernst Young LLP (the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company's financial statements), Dr. Felix Zandman, former Executive Chairman and Chief Technical and Business Development Officer of Vishay, and as a nominal defendant, Siliconix.
103730_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	The suit made various claims against Vishay and the other defendants for actions allegedly taken in respect of Siliconix during the period when Vishay owned an 80.4% interest in Siliconix.
103730_14_ITEM3_P3_S2	The action, which we refer to as the Proctor litigation on account of the lead plaintiff, sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages.
103730_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	In May 2005, Vishay successfully completed a tender offer to acquire all shares of Siliconix that were not already owned by Vishay.
103730_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	Following the announcement of Vishay's intent to make this tender offer, several purported class-action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
103730_14_ITEM3_P4_S2	These actions were consolidated into a single class action and a settlement agreement was reached with the plaintiffs, who effectively represented all non-Vishay stockholders of Siliconix.
103730_14_ITEM3_P4_S3	The settlement agreement was approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery in October 2005.
103730_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	The plaintiffs in the Proctor litigation filed an amended complaint in the Superior Court of California in November 2005.
103730_14_ITEM3_P5_S1	In June 2006, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a permanent injunction restraining the Proctor plaintiffs from prosecuting the Proctor action.
103730_14_ITEM3_P5_S2	An appeal of the injunction order brought by a former stockholder of Siliconix was dismissed by the Delaware Supreme Court in January 2007.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S0	In June 2006, the Proctor litigation was removed from the Superior Court of California to federal District Court.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S1	The District Court granted a motion by Ernst Young to dismiss the complaint and a motion by Vishay for summary judgment, effective October 15, 2007.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S2	The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and on October 9, 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Proctor's class action claim and remanded the remaining two claims to state court.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S3	On July 26, 2011, the Superior Court dismissed the remaining claims against Vishay with prejudice.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S4	On September 20, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S5	On December 11, 2012, the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Sixth Appellate District, heard oral arguments from the parties on the matter.
103730_14_ITEM3_P6_S6	On February 19, 2013, the Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court's dismissal of the remaining claims.
103730_14_ITEM3_P7_S0	On April 2, 2013 the plaintiffs filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of the State of California requesting that the Supreme Court of California review the decision of the Court of Appeal of the State of California affirming the Superior Court's dismissal of the Proctor Litigation.
103730_14_ITEM3_P7_S1	The Supreme Court of California denied the plaintiff's petition to review the case on June 12, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM3_P8_S0	Vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by Vishay and its subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_14_ITEM3_P9_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM3_P10_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.

103730_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VSH.
103730_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape for the indicated fiscal quarters.
103730_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Holders of record of our common stock totaled approximately 1,100 at February 17, 2014.
103730_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.
103730_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, the high and low sales prices of our common stock.
103730_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	At February 17, 2014, we had outstanding 12,129,227 shares of Class B common stock, par value $.10 per share, each of which entitles the holder to ten votes.
103730_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Class B common stock generally is not transferable except in certain very limited instances, and there is no market for those shares.
103730_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	The Class B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock on a share for share basis.
103730_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.4% of our Class B common stock, representing 42.4% of the total voting power of our capital stock.

103730_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	The amount and timing of any future dividends remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_14_ITEM5_P5_S3	Certain of our debt obligations contain restrictions as to the payment of cash dividends.
103730_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Vishay's common stock over a 5-year period with the returns on the Standard Poor's MidCap 400 Stock Index (of which Vishay is a component), the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index, and a peer group of companies selected by our management.
103730_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	The peer group is made up of five publicly-held manufacturers of semiconductors, resistors, capacitors, and other electronic components .
103730_14_ITEM5_P6_S2	Management believes that the product offerings of the companies contained in the peer group are more similar to our product offerings than those of the companies contained in any published industry index.
103730_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	The return of each peer issuer has been weighted according to the respective issuer's stock market capitalization.
103730_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	The line graph assumes that $100 had been invested at December 31, 2008 and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
103730_14_ITEM5_P7_S2	The cash equivalent of the shares received in the spin-off of VPG is included in Vishay's results below.
103730_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	* AVX Corporation, Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc., International Rectifier Corporation, KEMET Corporation, and ON Semiconductor Corporation.

103730_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	This table should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K (in thousands, except per share amounts):
103730_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Includes the results of MCB Industrie, from June 13, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	Also includes a net pretax reversal of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest on January 1, 2014, which were originally reported as a separate line item upon the cessation of employment of certain former executive officers in 2011 of $1,778,000, a $2,867,000 one-time tax benefit due to a new law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases our deferred tax assets, a $1,330,000 one-time tax benefit due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that was signed into law on January 2, 2013, partially offset by $2,814,000 of restructuring and severance costs.
103730_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.02 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM6_P1_S3	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) Includes the results of HiRel Systems LLC from January 13, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	Also includes net pretax gain on the sale of property in Belgium vacated as a result of restructuring in prior years of $12,153,000 and a $4,036,000 one-time tax benefit related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances in Israel following a merger of several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits.
103730_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.08 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM6_P2_S3	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Includes the results of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric from September 28, 2011.
103730_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	Also includes net pretax charges of $5,762,000 to accelerate the recognition of certain executive compensation expenses upon the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman of the Board, Dr. Zandman, and for elements of executive compensation payable upon the resignation of our former Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Lior Yahalomi.
103730_14_ITEM6_P3_S2	Also includes $10,024,000 of one-time tax expense related to the write-down of deferred tax assets in Israel to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate enacted in January 2011 on certain types of income earned after December 31, 2010 and $6,538,000 of one-time tax benefits recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances in various jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM6_P3_S3	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a negative $0.04 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM6_P3_S4	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as businesses that have been spun off, restructuring and severance costs, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains and losses on sales of property, asset write-downs, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Discrete semiconductors and passive components manufactured by Vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronic products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	We operate in five product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have repurchased 44.3 million shares of our common stock since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, representing 24% of our shares outstanding before we began this initiative.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	The exchange of $56.4 million principal amount of our exchangeable unsecured notes by a holder of the notes in the third fiscal quarter of 2013 increased the number of our common shares outstanding by 3.7 million, but did not affect the number of weighted average shares outstanding used for computing diluted earnings per share because our earnings per share computation assumes that the exchangeable unsecured notes would be converted.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	On February 3, 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	The permitted capacity to repurchase shares of stock or pay dividends under our credit facility increases each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	At December 31, 2013, our total permitted capacity to repurchase shares of stock or pay dividends under our credit facility is $204.6 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P3_S7	Although we have no current plans, we will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	We continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	In response to the current economic environment, we began implementing a targeted cost reduction program in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 to support our profitability without jeopardizing our growth plan.
103730_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1.
103730_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Despite the higher net revenues in the second half of 2013, it did not meet management's expectations and nearly all of the remaining key financial metrics were lower compared to the first half of 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	The year 2013 was slightly stronger than the year 2012, which resulted in an increase of nearly all key financial metrics compared with the prior year.
103730_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $2.371 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.230 billion and $2.594 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $123.0 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $122.7 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, and $238.8 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 include items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliation below.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share do not have uniform definitions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_14_ITEM7_P7_S6	Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations.
103730_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	* Includes add-back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive.
103730_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our results for 2013 and 2012 demonstrate our ability to react quickly to changing economic environments and successfully implement cost reduction measures when necessary to sustain earnings.
103730_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Despite revenues below our expected run-rate, our pre-tax results were as we would expect based on our business model.
103730_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 were also affected by macroeconomic concerns, which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year.
103730_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	This period of macroeconomic concern followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of 2011 in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession at the same sales volume.
103730_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	We also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices ("ASP").
103730_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	We analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	(1) Operating margin for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 includes a $1.8 million stock compensation credit related to performance-based stock compensation for certain former executives, following a determination that achievement of the three-year performance targets was no longer probable (see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 includes a $2.8 million restructuring and severance expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	(2) End-of-period backlog for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 reflects a total of $15.5 million related to the backlog of MCB Industrie S.A. as of the date of acquisition.
103730_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	See "Financial Metrics by Segment" below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Following a period of low distributor demand and a deteriorating business environment experienced in the second half of 2012, our results improved through the first half of 2013, driven by the restocking of distributor inventory and improving customer demand.
103730_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The third fiscal quarter of 2013 was burdened by a sudden decrease in orders from distributors and produced disappointing results, but orders from distributors increased in the fourth fiscal quarter, which led to an increase in revenues and backlog versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Average selling prices continue to decline primarily due to our commodity semiconductor products.
103730_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Gross margins were negatively impacted by additional depreciation associated with our cost reduction programs in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Gross margins improved versus the prior year periods due to the increased sales volume.
103730_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Due to the increase in orders, the book-to-bill ratio increased to 0.99 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 from 0.93 in the third fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 0.98 and 0.99, respectively, versus ratios of 0.91 and 0.96, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our existing product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA").
103730_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay's four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, an average of approximately $100 million of revenues per year.
103730_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions with a purchase price larger than $500 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	On June 13, 2013, we acquired MCB Industrie S.A. ("MCB Industrie") in France, a well-established manufacturer of specialty resistors and sensors, for $23.0 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired is expected to enable us to expand our presence in the European industrial market.
103730_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from June 13, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	On January 13, 2012, we acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for approximately $85.5 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired further enhance our inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from January 13, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	On September 28, 2011, we acquired the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric, Inc., for approximately $19.3 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The businesses acquired further enhance our broad resistor portfolio, particularly in the high power and high current ranges, as well as with resistor assemblies for industrial applications.
103730_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for these businesses have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from September 28, 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products, particularly our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry and inflation drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our variable cost reduction efforts include expending capital to increase automation and maximize the efficiency in our production facilities, consolidating materials purchasing across regions and divisions to achieve economies of scale, materials substitution, maintaining an appropriate mix of in-house production and subcontractor production, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	We seek to maintain selling, general, and administrative expenses at current quarterly levels, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Our fixed cost control efforts include automating administrative processes through the expansion of IT systems, gradually migrating to common IT systems across our organization, streamlining our legal entity structure, and reducing our external resource needs by utilizing more cost-effective in-house personnel, while utilizing external resources when day-to-day expertise is not required in-house.
103730_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Between 2001 and 2009, we recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs totaling $320 million and related asset write-downs totaling $89 million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward.
103730_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	We also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	We did not initiate any new restructuring projects in 2010, 2011, or 2012 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during such periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Occasionally, our ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate and we must take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness.
103730_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	On October 28, 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	We recorded $2.8 million of restructuring and severance expenses in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 for the expenses that were recognizable under GAAP during the period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	The remaining expenses associated with the programs will be recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The programs primarily focus on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees Company-wide.
103730_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	We also plan to implement two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	The programs in total are expected to lower costs by approximately $36 million per year when fully implemented at expected cash costs of approximately $32 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	The project for the MOSFETs segment will extend over a period of approximately two years.
103730_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The manufacture of wafers for a substantial share of products will be transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a consequence, certain other wafer manufacturing currently occurring in-house will be transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	The total cash costs associated with the MOSFETs initiatives, principally severance, are expected to be approximately $16 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Once fully implemented, we anticipate that the MOSFETs programs will result in an annual reduction in variable and fixed manufacturing costs of approximately $23 million at current volumes.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement offer has been made to employees worldwide who are eligible because they have met job classification, age, and/or years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The program benefits vary by country and job classification, but generally offer a cash loyalty bonus.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	All responses are due, subject to applicable rescission rights, on or before March 28, 2014.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Accodingly, we expect most costs associated with this program will be recorded in the first fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	The voluntary separation / early retirement program will not impact manufacturing operations or our growth plan.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	Our named executive officers (as defined in our proxy statement) and certain other key employees, generally research, development, and engineering personnel, are not eligible for the voluntary separation / early retirement program.
103730_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	The effective separation / retirement date for most eligible employees who accept the offer will be June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a transition period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	As expected, as of December 31, 2013, only a limited number of employees have tendered irrevocable voluntary termination notices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	We have received satisfactory expressions of interest and we expect most formal responses to be received closer to the March 28 deadline.
103730_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	We estimate that total costs associated with the voluntary separation / early retirement program will be approximately $13 million, based on the expected acceptance rate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Once fully implemented, the Company anticipates that the program will result in an annual reduction in fixed costs of approximately $10 million, split approximately one-third in manufacturing and two-thirds in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Two other smaller cost reduction programs relate to the transfer of production of certain products within our Diodes segment, which will be implemented in the course of 2014.
103730_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Both programs are connected to production moves, in order to take advantage of lower labor costs in one program and from the consolidation of manufacturing locations in the other.
103730_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The total cash costs associated with these production transfers are expected to be approximately $3 million, and will result in annual cost savings of approximately $3 million when fully implemented.
103730_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Except for the distinct and targeted programs noted above, we do not anticipate any other material restructuring activities during the remainder of 2013 or 2014.
103730_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	As we have demonstrated the past two years, we believe that we can substantially maintain our trained workforce, even at lower manufacturing activity levels, by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, a continued sluggish business environment for the electronics industry or the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	We have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to our acquisitions of Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, LLC, or MCB Industrie, but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Even as we seek to manage our costs, we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
103730_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock.
103730_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	We plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	To foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by 18% since 2009 and plan to further increase it; we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities; we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase our market access to the industrial segment and increase the design-in of our products in local markets; and we are directing increased funding and focus on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	These efforts as well as our broad and innovative product portfolio and strong position in distribution worldwide have us positioned very well in case of a dramatic upturn in the economy.
103730_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	Our growth plan also targets adding, through acquisitions, $100 million of revenues per year on average.
103730_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	we continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities despite the current economic volatility.
103730_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	While we have in the past used forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures, we generally have not done so in recent periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the "functional currency" of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	A subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company's operations generally would have the parent company's currency as its functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	The dollar generally was weaker during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars generally increasing reported revenues and expenses versus the prior year.
103730_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 have been slightly unfavorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk.
103730_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	We recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	We earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees' periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by our management that we believe are reasonable.
103730_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	If we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is not required.
103730_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is required.
103730_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	In the first step of the quantitative impairment test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	The comparable companies utilized are generally the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance graph in Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
103730_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	In step two of the quantitative impairment test, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired those business units.
103730_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Specifically, we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill.
103730_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two.
103730_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Fair value of reporting units, and the underlying assets and liabilities of those reporting units, is measured at a point in time, and reflects specific market conditions as of the measurement date.
103730_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	We perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We assess the impairment of our long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames, including property and equipment, long-term prepaid assets, and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
103730_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and evaluated as a group.
103730_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets, changes in historical or projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends.
103730_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group, primarily determined using discounted future cash flows.
103730_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Indefinite-lived intangible assets (which for us are comprised entirely of tradenames) are not amortized, but similar to goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	These tests are performed more frequently if there are triggering events.
103730_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	When testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset.
103730_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	If we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired, we would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset.
103730_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2013, one customer comprised 13.9% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	This customer comprised 14.7% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2013 or December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our U.S. plans include a plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and various non-qualified plans.
103730_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	The table below summarizes information about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	This information should be read in conjunction with Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements (amounts in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for certain postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P88_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_14_ITEM7_P88_S4	We use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_14_ITEM7_P88_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	For our U.S. qualified plan, we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk.
103730_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	Based on current market interest rate conditions and the current market value of the plan assets, our qualified defined benefit plan in the U.S. is fully-funded.
103730_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	Accordingly, we have revised the asset allocation strategy for this plan with the intention of further reducing risk.
103730_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	Non-qualified plans in the U.S. are considered by law to be unfunded.
103730_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	However, the Company maintains assets in a rabbi trust to fund benefit payments under certain of these plans.
103730_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	Some non-U.S. plans also informally fund their plans by holding certain available-for-sale investments.
103730_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_14_ITEM7_P93_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	We expect net periodic pension cost in 2014 to be less than net periodic pension cost recognized in 2013, with a decrease in the amortization of unrecognized losses partially offset by lower expected returns on assets subsequent to implementation of our asset de-risking strategies.
103730_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions will be required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Accordingly, net periodic pension cost for U.S. plans no longer include any service cost.
103730_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	We continue to seek to de-risk our pension exposures, especially given the frozen status of the U.S. plans and the current funded status.
103730_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Such actions could result in increased net periodic pension cost due to lower expected rates of return on plan assets and/or possible charges to recognize unamortized actuarial items if all or a portion of the obligations were to be settled.
103730_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
103730_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	These accruals are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are examined and finally resolved.
103730_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	We and our subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an examination of our U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	Because of net operating losses which were fully utilized on the 2010 tax return, our U.S. federal tax returns for 2003 through 2009 remain subject to examination.
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	Most principal subsidiaries in Israel are currently under examination for tax years 2008 through 2010.
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S4	The tax returns of other significant non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include India (2004 through 2011), China (2009), and the Republic of Taiwan (2007 through 2012).
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S5	In 2013, we settled an examination of the 2005 through 2008 tax years for our subsidiaries in Germany.
103730_14_ITEM7_P102_S6	We and our subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	We account for uncertainty in income tax positions using the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as prescribed in GAAP.
103730_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be "more likely than not" to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
103730_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_14_ITEM7_P104_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Substantially all earnings generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	Statement of operations' captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Overall, the business conditions in 2013 were better than the 2012 conditions, but both years were below our expected run-rate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	Our revenue results for the year ended December 31, 2011 also represent the effects of macroeconomic concerns, which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year, and the resulting quick adaptation of our manufacturing capacities in response thereto.
103730_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	This period of macroeconomic concerns followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of 2011 in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the 2008-2009 global economic recession at the same sales volume.
103730_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_14_ITEM7_P111_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $84.3 million, $72.7 million, and $80.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.4%, 3.2%, and 3.0%, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P111_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were approximately $83.2 million, $76.9 million, and $82.3 million, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P111_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $6.4 million, $7.1 million, and $6.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 23.9%, as compared to 23.6% for year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2012 were 23.6%, as compared to 27.8% for year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	This decrease in gross profit margin reflects significantly lower volume and lower average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the MOSFETs segment was as follows:
103730_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	The MOSFETs segment was positively affected by increased demand from OEM customers in Asia in 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The gross profit margin remained below expectations in 2013 as the increase in volume and lower materials prices were almost fully offset by the decrease in average selling prices and the negative effect of additional depreciation associated with our cost reduction program.
103730_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to decreases in sales volume and average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	Also, a non-recurring manufacturing issue associated with purchased materials affected the 2012 results.
103730_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	We have experienced significant declines in average selling prices in 2013 and 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	The decline in 2013 is partially due to lower materials prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	The decline in 2012 is partially due to selective volume based pricing for our MOSFETs products that we implemented in the second fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	On October 28, 2013, we announced a cost reduction program to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	We continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the MOSFETs segment and continue to make capital and R D investments in this business.
103730_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Diodes segment was as follows:
103730_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Diodes segment was positively affected by the increased demand from distributors in Asia in 2013, but negatively affected by the low demand from distributors in Asia in 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P127_S1	The increase in gross profit margin from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the increase in sales volume, manufacturing efficiencies, and lower materials prices, partially offset by decreased average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P127_S2	The decrease in the Diodes segment gross profit margin from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume.
103730_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	Typical pricing pressure for our established Diodes products continues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	We have experienced moderate price declines versus the prior year periods.
103730_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	The cost reduction programs announced on October 28, 2013 include two smaller projects to improve the results of the Diodes segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	These projects demonstrate our ongoing effort to improve the results of this segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Optoelectronic Components segment was as follows:
103730_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment was relatively stable due to the continued strong demand of the automotive and industrial markets despite being negatively affected by the low demand from distributors in Asia in 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	The Optoelectronic Components segment has now fully recovered with primarily volume-driven gross margin improvement.
103730_14_ITEM7_P133_S2	The increase in gross profit margin in 2013 is due to increases in volume, partialy offset by lower average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P133_S3	The segment gross profit margin remained high in 2012 despite a decrease in sales volume and average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	Typical pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products continues.
103730_14_ITEM7_P134_S1	We have experienced slight declines in 2013 versus 2012 and moderate declines in 2012 versus 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Resistors Inductors segment was as follows:
103730_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	The Resistors Inductors segment has experienced four consecutive quarters of revenue growth.
103730_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	The growth was experienced in almost all end markets and regions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P138_S2	The biggest source of growth was from distributors.
103730_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	The Resistors Inductors segment was negatively affected in 2012 by a slowing of demand in Europe.
103730_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	The segment gross profit margin remained high, but decreased slightly versus 2012 due to the increased volume and reduced material prices not being able to fully offset the reduction in average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	The segment gross profit margin remained high, but decreased slightly from 2011 to 2012 due to decreases in sales volume.
103730_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	Along with our successful acquisitions of HiRel Systems and certain assets of Huntington Electric in the previous two years, MCB Industrie is positively contributing to gross margins of the Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	Average selling prices declined slightly in both 2013 versus 2012 and 2012 versus 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Capacitors segment was as follows:
103730_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	The Capacitors segment was negatively affected by the economic slow-down which began in the second half of 2012 and stagnation in demand for renewable energies as government spending declined.
103730_14_ITEM7_P145_S1	Additionally, the segment experienced a decrease in sales to the automotive industry in 2013, which was partially offset by increased distributions sales.
103730_14_ITEM7_P145_S2	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P145_S3	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and some temporary inefficiencies.
103730_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	The Capacitors segment was adversely affected by high distributor inventory levels in the second half of 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	Lower demand and a reduction in material prices have increased the pressure on average selling prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	Average selling prices declined slightly in both 2013 versus 2012 and 2012 versus 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	The overall increase in SG A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to less austere temporary cost reduction programs implemented in 2013 versus 2012 due to differences in economic environment.
103730_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	The overall decrease in SG A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2012 versus the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to cost containment initiatives and certain temporary cost reduction programs, lower bonus accruals for 2012, and a positive exchange rate impact, partially offset by SG A expenses of acquired businesses.
103730_14_ITEM7_P149_S2	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	The acquisitions of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in the third fiscal quarter of 2011, HiRel Systems LLC in the first fiscal quarter of 2012, and MCB Industrie S.A. in the second fiscal quarter of 2013 increased our amortizable intangible assets balance by $56.5 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P150_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for an estimate of our annual amortization expense through 2018.
103730_14_ITEM7_P150_S2	Additional acquisition activity will increase these amounts.
103730_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	Amortization expense remained stable in 2012 versus 2011 principally due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, which was offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the aforementioned acquisitions of the resistors businesses of Huntington Electric in the third fiscal quarter of 2011 and HiRel Systems LLC in the first fiscal quarter of 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	We also recorded a $12.2 million gain on the sale of vacated property in Belgium in the second fiscal quarter of 2012 that is reported on a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	On October 28, 2013, we announced a voluntary separation / early retirement program targeting SG A expenses.
103730_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $0.5 million versus the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2042 that were issued on May 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	The decrease in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily due to lower interest rates on the short-term investments in 2013 versus 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $3.3 million versus the year ended December 31, 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2041 and due 2042 that were issued on May 13, 2011 and May 31, 2012, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold ancillary investments in the equity of two companies located outside of the U.S. for a total gain of $1.4 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	The decrease in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2012 versus the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to lower interest rates on the short-term investments in 2012 versus 2011.
103730_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, the effective tax rates were 29.8%, 27.4%, and 27.5%, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P161_S1	The effective tax rates are generally less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances when facts and circumstances permit.
103730_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	These items total $(4.2) million (tax benefit), $(4.0) million (tax benefit), and $3.5 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the discrete items include a $2.9 million benefit recorded in the third fiscal quarter due to a new tax law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases our deferred tax assets and a $1.3 million benefit recorded in the first fiscal quarter due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Israel due to a merger of several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel in the fourth fiscal quarter, which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone.
103730_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the discrete items included a $10.0 million expense for the effect of a tax rate change on deferred taxes in Israel recorded in the first fiscal quarter, reduced by $1.0 million for a 2010 tax return filing in the fourth fiscal quarter, and partially offset by benefits related to reductions of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions of $5.5 million recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	The reductions of valuation allowances were principally in Belgium due to expected future income from a pending real estate sale.
103730_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_14_ITEM7_P166_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P166_S2	Part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_14_ITEM7_P166_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate.
103730_14_ITEM7_P166_S4	Changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_14_ITEM7_P168_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy, to reduce debt levels, and to pay dividends and repurchase stock.
103730_14_ITEM7_P168_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 12 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 19 years.
103730_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as "free cash," a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_14_ITEM7_P169_S1	Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 17 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 12 years.
103730_14_ITEM7_P169_S2	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash in line with our history despite the volatile economic environment during the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P170_S1	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	Beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we have reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company's capital structure.
103730_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	We have completed three issuances of low-coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance.
103730_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	We utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase 44.3 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 24% of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives.
103730_14_ITEM7_P171_S3	In the third fiscal quarter of 2013, a holder of our exchangeable unsecured notes exercised its option to exchange $56.4 million principal amount of the notes for 3.7 million shares of our common stock.
103730_14_ITEM7_P171_S4	The exchange increases the number of our common shares outstanding, but has no effect on the calculation of the weighted average shares outstanding used for computing diluted earnings per share because our earnings per share computation assumes that the exchangeable unsecured notes would be converted, while also reducing our outstanding debt and improving our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity.
103730_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	We also entered into a new, larger, revolving credit facility in 2010, which was amended and restated on August 8, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	The amended and restated credit facility extends the term of our available credit, secures lower interest rates than we were previously paying for the next five years, and provides us with additional financial flexibility to pursue our growth plan.
103730_14_ITEM7_P172_S2	The total revolving commitment of our credit facility increased to $640 million and we have the ability to request up to an additional $50 million of incremental commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P172_S3	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $114 million and $89 million, respectively, were outstanding under our credit facility.
103730_14_ITEM7_P172_S4	The credit facility provides a revolving commitment through August 8, 2018.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S2	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S3	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S4	We are also required to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount based on our leverage ratio.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S5	Based on our current leverage ratio, the facility fee is 0.35% per annum.
103730_14_ITEM7_P173_S6	Such facility fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	The amendment and restatement of the credit facility also removed certain restrictions related to the incurrence and repayment of certain intercompany indebtedness, mergers, liquidations, and transfers of ownership of wholly owned subsidiaries that were present in the original credit agreement.
103730_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	These changes will enable us to streamline our complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P175_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_14_ITEM7_P175_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	The credit facility also limits or restricts us, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and making other restricted payments, and requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article VI of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed August 8, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P178_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 12.46 to 1 and 1.86 to 1, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM7_P178_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_14_ITEM7_P179_S1	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	Our permitted capacity to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock or pay cash dividends under the credit facility increases each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_14_ITEM7_P180_S1	At December 31, 2013, our credit facility allowed us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends up to $204.6 million.
103730_14_ITEM7_P180_S2	On February 3, 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_14_ITEM7_P180_S3	The initial cash dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock will be paid on March 27, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2014.
103730_14_ITEM7_P180_S4	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividend payments remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	The balance of our revolving credit facility was $89 million at December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P181_S1	We borrowed $189 million and repaid $164 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P181_S2	Included in both the amounts borrowed and repaid is $108 million borrowed to repay the amounts outstanding on our credit facility at the time it was amended and restated.
103730_14_ITEM7_P181_S3	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $103.3 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $114 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P182_S0	Management expects to continue to maintain the outstanding balance on the credit facility around its current level, and may periodically pay down the balance with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_14_ITEM7_P182_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, regular dividend payments, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_14_ITEM7_P182_S2	Acquisition activity or share repurchases may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_14_ITEM7_P182_S3	No principal payments on our outstanding debt are due before the maturity of our revolving credit facility in August 2018.
103730_14_ITEM7_P183_S0	Substantially all of our December 31, 2013 cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P183_S1	At the present time, we expect the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely.
103730_14_ITEM7_P183_S2	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the U.S., we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_14_ITEM7_P183_S3	Our substantially undrawn credit facility provides us with significant liquidity in the U.S.
103730_14_ITEM7_P184_S0	We invest a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated condensed balance sheets.
103730_14_ITEM7_P184_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_14_ITEM7_P185_S0	The interest rates on our short-term investments average 0.5% and are approximately 20 basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_14_ITEM7_P185_S1	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.
103730_14_ITEM7_P186_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively (in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P187_S0	Measurements such as "free cash" and "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_14_ITEM7_P187_S1	Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_14_ITEM7_P187_S2	However, management believes that "free cash" is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends, and that an analysis of "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_14_ITEM7_P187_S3	These measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_14_ITEM7_P188_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2013 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.4 to 1, as compared to 4.3 to 1 as of December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P188_S1	The slight increase is primarily due to an increase in cash and short-term investments in 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P188_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity was 0.19 to 1 at December 31, 2013 as compared to a ratio of 0.24 to 1 at December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P188_S3	The significant decrease in the ratio is primarily due to the exchange by a holder of $56.4 million principal amount of our exchangeable unsecured notes for shares of our common stock in the third fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P189_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $292.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $287.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P190_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $153.1 million, as compared to $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7_P190_S1	We expect capital spending of approximately $160 million in 2014.
103730_14_ITEM7_P191_S0	As of December 31, 2013 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM7_P192_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_14_ITEM7_P192_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_14_ITEM7_P193_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement, one of which bears a maturity date of 2102, and include facility fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on August 8, 2018.
103730_14_ITEM7_P193_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042.
103730_14_ITEM7_P194_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_14_ITEM7_P194_S1	Among other things, approximately $614 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock at the option of the holder.
103730_14_ITEM7_P194_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_14_ITEM7_P194_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our variable-rate exchangeable notes due 2102 and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2013, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_14_ITEM7_P195_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 includes liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_14_ITEM7_P195_S1	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax examinations throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM7_P195_S2	Accordingly, we have classified the amount recorded as a current liability as payable within one year, and the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_14_ITEM7_P196_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_14_ITEM7_P196_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_14_ITEM7_P196_S2	See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_14_ITEM7_P196_S3	These obligations were not material to us as of December 31, 2013, and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above.
103730_14_ITEM7_P197_S0	We maintain long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_14_ITEM7_P197_S1	The purchase commitments in the table above represent the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these agreements.
103730_14_ITEM7_P197_S2	Our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments.
103730_14_ITEM7_P198_S0	GAAP requires that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P198_S1	The purchase commitments for silicon wafers described above are for the manufacture of proprietary products using Vishay Siliconix-owned technology licensed to these subcontractors by Siliconix, and accordingly, management can only estimate the "market price" of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments.
103730_14_ITEM7_P198_S2	Management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices.
103730_14_ITEM7_P199_S0	Other long-term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P199_S1	Other long-term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_14_ITEM7_P200_S0	As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, on May 13, 2009, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with the late Dr. Felix Zandman, our founder and former Executive Chairman, Chief Technical and Business Development Officer.
103730_14_ITEM7_P200_S1	Pursuant to the amended and restated employment agreement, Dr. Zandman received $10 million upon signing the agreement and five additional annual payments of $10 million each, one of which remains to be paid to his estate as of December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P200_S2	Dr. Zandman's passing in June 2011 had no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_14_ITEM7_P201_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, executive employment agreements, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM7_P202_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_14_ITEM7_P203_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_14_ITEM7_P203_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_14_ITEM7_P204_S0	See also "Commodity Price Risk" included in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional related information.
103730_14_ITEM7_P205_S0	As more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, new accounting guidance became effective for us in 2013.
103730_14_ITEM7_P205_S1	There is no effective accounting guidance pending adoption as of December 31, 2013 that is expected to have a material effect on our future financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_14_ITEM7_P206_S0	The adoption of the new guidance in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The exchangeable notes, of which $38.6 million are outstanding, bear interest at LIBOR (reset quarterly).
103730_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2013, we had $114 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2013, we have $640.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $511.2 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2013, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $3.4 million.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Also see "Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S6	Where possible, we maintain local currency denominated cash balances in these countries approximately equal to the local currency liabities to naturally hedge our exposures.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S7	We also have a higher percentage of Euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S8	Therefore, when the Euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is increased.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P9_S9	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $2.4 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P10_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P12_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P14_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P15_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P15_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P15_S2	We acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short-term commitments.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P16_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_14_ITEM7A_P18_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $7.1 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.
103730_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1 of this report.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
103730_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the 1992 framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Ernst Young LLP has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein on page F-3.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
103730_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The certifications of our CEO and CFO pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

103730_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s management.
103730_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria).
103730_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Vishay Intertechnology Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology Inc. maintained in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 and our report dated February 19, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_14_ITEM15_P76_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_14_ITEM15_P76_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2013 through the date these financial statements were issued through the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
103730_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P78_S2	For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_14_ITEM15_P79_S2	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, "stock, ship and debit" credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P80_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_14_ITEM15_P80_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P80_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $ 6,362 , $ 7,131 , and $ 6,633 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_14_ITEM15_P84_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $ 62,090 , $ 57,164 , and $ 55,809 , for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P84_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Government grants received by certain subsidiaries, primarily in Israel, are recognized as income in accordance with the purpose of the specific contract and in the period in which the related expense is incurred.
103730_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	Grants recognized as a reduction of costs of products sold were $ 406 , $ 351 , and $ 483 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	Deferred grant income included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 1,882 and $ 1,548 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	The grants are subject to certain conditions, including maintaining specified levels of employment for periods up to ten years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	Noncompliance with such conditions could result in the repayment of grants.
103730_14_ITEM15_P86_S2	However, management expects that the Company will comply with all terms and conditions of the grants.
103730_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P88_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_14_ITEM15_P88_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of "more likely than not" to be realilzed.
103730_14_ITEM15_P88_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P88_S4	If the Company's assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_14_ITEM15_P88_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	At the present time, substantially all earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_14_ITEM15_P89_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P90_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_14_ITEM15_P91_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P91_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_14_ITEM15_P92_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_14_ITEM15_P92_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_14_ITEM15_P92_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	The amount included in current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect only amounts expected to be settled in cash within one year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P94_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_14_ITEM15_P96_S1	If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_14_ITEM15_P96_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $ 62 , $ (24) , and $ (93) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P98_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P98_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.
103730_14_ITEM15_P98_S4	The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at December 31, 2013 was approximately $ 35,541 .
103730_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense.
103730_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	Depreciation expense was $ 155,064 , $ 153,801 , and $ 165,022 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and administrative expenses).
103730_14_ITEM15_P100_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_14_ITEM15_P101_S1	The required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P101_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	Certain of the Company's tradenames have been assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P103_S2	Capitalized software is amortized over periods of three to ten years, primarily included in costs of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P103_S3	Customer relationships are amortized over useful lives of five to twenty years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P103_S4	Noncompete agreements are amortized over periods of four to ten years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P103_S5	The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P104_S1	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_14_ITEM15_P104_S2	If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not required.
103730_14_ITEM15_P104_S3	If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is required.
103730_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_14_ITEM15_P105_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets before performing a quantitative impairment test.
103730_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	There was no impairment identified through the annual impairment tests completed in 2013, 2012, or 2011.
103730_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_14_ITEM15_P111_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_14_ITEM15_P111_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_14_ITEM15_P112_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for anticipated disposal costs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	Other assets reported on the consolidated balance sheets include investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_14_ITEM15_P113_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11) and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_14_ITEM15_P113_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_14_ITEM15_P113_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until sold.
103730_14_ITEM15_P113_S4	At the time of sale the assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P114_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_14_ITEM15_P114_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_14_ITEM15_P116_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_14_ITEM15_P116_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Company has also in the past used financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion, but not all, of its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_14_ITEM15_P117_S2	The purpose of the Company's foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM15_P119_S2	The Company's operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_14_ITEM15_P120_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P120_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_14_ITEM15_P121_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs") that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2013 and 2012 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	Restructuring and severance costs reflect charges resulting from cost reduction programs implemented by the Company.
103730_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	Restructuring and severance costs include exit costs, severance benefits pursuant to an on-going arrangement, voluntary termination compensation under a defined program, and any related pension curtailment and settlement charges.
103730_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	The Company recognizes expense for one-time benefits only after management has committed to a plan, the plan is sufficiently detailed to provide the number, classification, and location of employees to be terminated as well as the expected completion date, the plan has been sufficiently communicated to employees such that they are able to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if terminated, and it is unlikely that the plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.
103730_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	If an employee is not required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense once the aforementioned criteria have been met.
103730_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	If an employee is required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense over the period that the employee is required to render future service.
103730_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	The Company recognizes expense for on-going benefit arrangements when the liability is reasonably estimable and considered probable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Company recognizes expense for voluntary separation / early retirement when the employee delivers an irrevocable voluntary termination notice pursuant to a defined company program.
103730_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Company recognizes other exit costs as incurred.
103730_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers' liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_14_ITEM15_P134_S1	At December 31, 2013, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors' and officers' insurance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P134_S2	The captive insurance entity had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
103730_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	Restricted cash of $ 7,927 and $ 7,752 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_14_ITEM15_P136_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_14_ITEM15_P136_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P136_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income .
103730_14_ITEM15_P138_S1	The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
103730_14_ITEM15_P138_S2	The ASU does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P138_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P138_S4	Vishay adopted the ASU on January 1, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P138_S5	The adoption of the ASU had no effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	On June 13, 2013, Vishay acquired MCB Industrie S.A. ("MCB Industrie") in France, a well-established manufacturer of specialty resistors and sensors, for $ 23,034 , net of cash acquired.
103730_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired is expected to enable Vishay to expand its presence in the European industrial market.
103730_14_ITEM15_P141_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from June 13, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P141_S3	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P141_S4	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $ 5,433 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.

103730_14_ITEM15_P141_S6	The goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	On January 13, 2012, Vishay acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for $ 85,493 , net of cash acquired.
103730_14_ITEM15_P143_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired further enhanced the Company's inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.

103730_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_14_ITEM15_P148_S1	Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_14_ITEM15_P148_S2	The required annual impairment test of goodwill is completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P148_S3	These impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
103730_14_ITEM15_P148_S4	The Company's business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	Vishay recorded goodwill impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2008.
103730_14_ITEM15_P149_S1	Subsequent to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, there was no remaining goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet until the acquisition of the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric on September 28, 2011.
103730_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $15,068, $14,754, and $14,684, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2013 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	The Company places a strong emphasis on controlling its costs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P155_S0	Historically, the Company's primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_14_ITEM15_P155_S1	Between 2001 and 2009, the Company recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs and related asset write-downs in order to reduce its cost structure going forward.
103730_14_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	The Company did not initiate any new restructuring projects in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, or 2010.
103730_14_ITEM15_P158_S0	On October 28, 2013, the Company announced various cost reduction programs as part of its continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P158_S1	The cash costs of these programs, primarily severance, are expected to be approximately $32,000.
103730_14_ITEM15_P158_S2	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_14_ITEM15_P158_S3	Many of the severance costs will be recognized ratably over the required stay periods.
103730_14_ITEM15_P159_S0	The following table summarizes restructuring and related expenses which were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013 and reported on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations:
103730_14_ITEM15_P160_S0	Over a period of approximately 2 years and in a period of discrete steps, the manufacture of wafers for a substantial share of products will be transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_14_ITEM15_P160_S1	As a consequence, certain other manufacturing currently occurring in-house will be transferred to third-party foundries (see Note 13).
103730_14_ITEM15_P161_S0	The total severance costs associated with these initiatives are expected to be approximately $ 16,000 .
103730_14_ITEM15_P162_S0	Employees generally must remain with the Company during the production transfer period.
103730_14_ITEM15_P162_S1	Accordingly, the Company will accrue these severance costs ratably over the respective employees' remaining service periods.
103730_14_ITEM15_P163_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement program was offered to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P163_S1	The program benefits vary by country and job classification, but generally include a cash loyalty bonus based on years of service.
103730_14_ITEM15_P163_S2	All responses are due, subject to applicable rescission rights, on or before March 28, 2014.
103730_14_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Company expects most costs associated with this program to be recorded in the first fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_14_ITEM15_P164_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company received a limited number of irrevocable voluntary termination notices and recorded the related separation costs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P165_S0	These employees generally were not aligned with any particular segment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P165_S1	The effective separation / retirement date for most employees who accepted the offer was June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a short transition period.
103730_14_ITEM15_P166_S0	On April 3, 2012, Vishay sold a property in Belgium vacated as a result of its restructuring activities in prior years for approximately $14,200.
103730_14_ITEM15_P166_S1	At closing, Vishay recognized a gain on the sale of the property of $12,153 within its statements of operations and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $3,406 within its statement of cash flows.
103730_14_ITEM15_P166_S2	The remaining proceeds are reported as proceeds from the sale of property and equipment within the statements of cash flows as the cash is received.
103730_14_ITEM15_P166_S3	At December 31, 2013, the remaining amount receivable by the Company is $3,586.
103730_14_ITEM15_P167_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and noncontrolling interests consists of the following components:
103730_14_ITEM15_P168_S0	Significant components of income taxes are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P169_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.
103730_14_ITEM15_P169_S1	Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company makes significant judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets (principally net operating losses).
103730_14_ITEM15_P170_S1	The carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize these assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
103730_14_ITEM15_P171_S0	A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax provision is as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P172_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_14_ITEM15_P172_S1	These items total $(4,197) (tax benefit), $ (4,036) (tax benefit), and $ 3,486 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the discrete items include a $ 2,867 benefit recorded in the third fiscal quarter due to a new tax law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases the deferred tax assets, and a $ 1,330 benefit recorded in the first fiscal quarter due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Israel due to a merger of several of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel in the fourth fiscal quarter which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone.
103730_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the discrete items included a $ 10,024 expense for the effect of a tax rate change on deferred taxes in Israel recorded in the first fiscal quarter, reduced by $ 984 for a 2010 tax return filing in the fourth fiscal quarter, and partially offset by benefits related to reductions of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions of $ 5,554 recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter.
103730_14_ITEM15_P175_S1	The reductions of valuation allowances were principally in Belgium due to expected future income from a pending real estate sale.
103730_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had the following significant net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes:
103730_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	Approximately $ 72,926 of the carryforwards in Belgium resulted from the Company's acquisition of BCcomponents in 2002.
103730_14_ITEM15_P177_S1	Valuation allowances of $ 24,788 and $ 23,946 , as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, have been recorded through goodwill for these acquired net operating losses.
103730_14_ITEM15_P177_S2	Prior to the adoption of updated guidance in ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009, if tax benefits were recognized through the utilization of these acquired net operating losses, the benefits of such loss utilization were recorded as a reduction to goodwill.
103730_14_ITEM15_P177_S3	After the adoption of the updated guidance on January 1, 2009, the benefits of such losses are recorded as a reduction of tax expense.
103730_14_ITEM15_P177_S4	In 2013, 2012, and 2011, the tax benefit recognized through a reduction of acquisition-date valuation allowances recorded as a reduction of tax expense was $ 0 , $ 0 , and $ 4,299 , respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P177_S5	The reduction in valuation allowances included pre-acquisition allowances for losses in Austria and Netherlands.
103730_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had the following significant tax credit carryforwards available:
103730_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	At December 31, 2013, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,752,155 of foreign earnings, which the Company continues to expect to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_14_ITEM15_P179_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	As of December 31, 2008, the Company recorded additional tax expense for an expected repatriation of $ 112,500 because such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
103730_14_ITEM15_P181_S1	During the third fiscal quarter of 2012, the Company repatriated $ 72,100 of cash to the U.S., which substantially completed the $ 112,500 cash repatriation program the Company initiated in 2008.
103730_14_ITEM15_P181_S2	This repatriated cash was used to reduce the amount outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.
103730_14_ITEM15_P181_S3	At the present time, the Company expects that the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.
103730_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	Net income taxes paid were $ 44,757 , $ 46,611 , and $ 126,918 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	See Note 19 for a discussion of the tax-related uncertainties for the pre-spin-off period of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("VPG"), which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits of $45,877 and $51,771, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized.
103730_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_14_ITEM15_P186_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $7,766 and $8,513, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P186_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Company recognized $2,218, $2,833, and $3,795, respectively, in interest and penalties.
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an examination of Vishay's U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011.
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S2	Because of net operating losses which were fully utilized on the 2010 tax return, the Company's U.S. federal tax returns for 2003 through 2009 remain subject to examination.
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S3	Most principal subsidiaries in Israel are currently under examination for tax years 2008 through 2010.
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S4	The tax returns of other significant non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include India (2004 through 2011), China (2009), and the Republic of Taiwan (2007 through 2012).
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S5	In 2013, the Company settled an examination of the 2005 through 2008 tax years for its subsidiaries in Germany.
103730_14_ITEM15_P187_S6	The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that result from such examinations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current unrecognized tax benefits.
103730_14_ITEM15_P188_S2	The Company believes that in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations will conclude or the statutes of limitation on certain income tax periods open to examination will expire, or both.
103730_14_ITEM15_P188_S3	Given the uncertainties described above, the Company can only determine an estimate of potential decreases in unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $30,900 to $35,000.
103730_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_14_ITEM15_P190_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility").
103730_14_ITEM15_P190_S1	On August 8, 2013, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate commitment of $ 640,000 of revolving loans available until August 8, 2018 .
103730_14_ITEM15_P190_S2	The original credit agreement became effective December 1, 2010 and was scheduled to expire on December 1, 2015.
103730_14_ITEM15_P190_S3	The Credit Facility, as amended and restated, also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $ 50,000 of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an interest margin.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on the Company's leverage ratio.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S2	Based on the Company's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S3	The interest rate on the Company's borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if the Company's leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if the Company's leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S4	Vishay is also required to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount based on the Company's leverage ratio.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S5	Based on the Company's current leverage ratio, the facility fee is 0.35% per annum.
103730_14_ITEM15_P191_S6	Such facility fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if the Company's leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if the leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	The August 8, 2013 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also removes certain restrictions related to the incurrence and repayment of certain intercompany indebtedness, mergers, liquidations, and transfers of ownership of wholly owned subsidiaries that were present in the original credit agreement.
103730_14_ITEM15_P192_S1	These changes will enable the Company to streamline its complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_14_ITEM15_P193_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P193_S1	Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P193_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P193_S3	The Credit Facility also limits or restricts the Company and its subsidiaries, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its respective assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and making other restricted payments, and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	The Credit Facility permits the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock or pay cash dividends up to a permitted capacity, conditioned upon Vishay maintaining (i) a pro forma leverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.00, (ii) a pro forma interest expense coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00, and (iii) $300,000 of available liquidity, as defined in the Credit Facility.
103730_14_ITEM15_P194_S1	The permitted capacity to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock or pay cash dividends under the Credit Facility increases each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_14_ITEM15_P194_S2	At December 31, 2013, the Credit Facility allows the Company to repurchase its common stock or pay cash dividends up to $204,596 (See Note 7).
103730_14_ITEM15_P194_S3	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividends remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, material misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $ 25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P195_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the Company's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, there was $ 518,345 and $ 431,295 , respectively, available under the Credit Facility.
103730_14_ITEM15_P196_S1	Letters of credit totaling $ 7,655 and $ 7,705 were outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	Vishay currently has three issuances of convertible senior debentures outstanding with generally congruent terms.
103730_14_ITEM15_P197_S1	The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the three series of outstanding convertible senior debentures:
103730_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	The payment of cash dividends results in an adjustment to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for each issuance of the convertible senior debentures (See Note 7).
103730_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_14_ITEM15_P199_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company's estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P201_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances beginning ten years subsequent to issuance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P202_S0	Interest expense related to the debentures is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
103730_14_ITEM15_P203_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_14_ITEM15_P203_S1	None of these conditions had occurred as of December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P204_S0	The debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of Vishay's common stock or a combination thereof, at Vishay's option, at the conversion rate.
103730_14_ITEM15_P204_S1	At the direction of its Board of Directors, Vishay intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares.
103730_14_ITEM15_P204_S2	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "fundamental change" in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_14_ITEM15_P205_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to the respective call dates, except in connection with certain tax-related events.
103730_14_ITEM15_P205_S1	On or after the call date and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay's common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_14_ITEM15_P206_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $ 105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_14_ITEM15_P206_S1	The notes are governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_14_ITEM15_P206_S2	The notes may be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, may be called by Vishay for similar consideration.
103730_14_ITEM15_P207_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes are deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_14_ITEM15_P208_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spin-off, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,042 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_14_ITEM15_P208_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_14_ITEM15_P209_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement the holders may at any time put the notes to Vishay in exchange for shares of Vishay's common stock, and Vishay may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.
103730_14_ITEM15_P209_S1	Subsequent to the spin-off of VPG, the put/call rate of the Vishay notes is $ 15.39 per share of common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P210_S0	The payment of quarterly cash dividends does not result in an adjustment to the put/call rate of the notes (See Note 7).
103730_14_ITEM15_P211_S0	Effective August 26, 2013, a holder of the notes exercised its option to exchange $ 56,400 principal amount of the notes for 3,664,729 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P211_S1	Following this transaction, Vishay had outstanding exchangeable unsecured notes with a principal amount of $38,642, which are exchangeable for an aggregate of 2,511,742 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P212_S0	The notes bear interest at LIBOR.
103730_14_ITEM15_P212_S1	Interest continues to be payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each calendar year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P213_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P214_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P214_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_14_ITEM15_P215_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $27,400, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_14_ITEM15_P216_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $18,200, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	Interest paid was $17,647, $16,578, and $14,084 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
103730_14_ITEM15_P219_S0	The Company's Class B common stock carries ten votes per share while the common stock carries one vote per share.
103730_14_ITEM15_P219_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P219_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P219_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P220_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P220_S1	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_14_ITEM15_P220_S2	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.
103730_14_ITEM15_P221_S0	On May 31, 2012, the Company repurchased 13,948,687 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000.

103730_14_ITEM15_P221_S2	At December 31, 2013, the Credit Facility allows the Company to repurchase its common stock or pay cash dividends up to $204,596, conditioned upon the Company maintaining specific pro forma financial ratios and a required minimum amount of available liquidity, as defined in the credit agreement.
103730_14_ITEM15_P221_S3	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P222_S0	The Company issued 8,823,529 warrants to acquire shares of Vishay common stock as part of the purchase price for the 2002 acquisition of BCcomponents.
103730_14_ITEM15_P222_S1	These warrants expired in December 2012.
103730_14_ITEM15_P223_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P224_S0	*The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are convertible into 19,809,103 , 7,884,885 , and 12,704,055 shares, respectively, of Vishay common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P225_S0	The Company has reserved the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_14_ITEM15_P226_S0	On February 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.
103730_14_ITEM15_P226_S1	The initial cash dividend of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock will be paid on March 27, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2014.
103730_14_ITEM15_P226_S2	Future dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	The caption "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:
103730_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	In the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold ancillary investments in the equity of two companies located outside of the U.S. for a total gain of $1,396.
103730_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P231_S0	Reclassifications of pension and other post-retirement actuarial items out of AOCI are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
103730_14_ITEM15_P231_S1	(See Note 11 for further information).
103730_14_ITEM15_P231_S2	The amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of securities held by the Company's rabbi trust used to fund a deferred compensation plan was $1,966, $0, and $17 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P231_S3	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of compensation expense within Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	The pre-tax amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of available-for-sale securities was $53, $0, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P232_S1	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of Other Income on our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P232_S2	The tax effect of the reclassifications of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities is recorded as a component of Income Tax Expense on our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay's proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_14_ITEM15_P235_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_14_ITEM15_P238_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_14_ITEM15_P238_S1	These include pension plans which are "qualified" under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code, and "non-qualified" pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_14_ITEM15_P238_S2	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P239_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans historically included both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_14_ITEM15_P239_S1	The Company's principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_14_ITEM15_P239_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P240_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_14_ITEM15_P240_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_14_ITEM15_P240_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P240_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P241_S1	All of the Company's qualified U.S. pension plans have been merged into the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_14_ITEM15_P242_S0	The Company's principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_14_ITEM15_P242_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_14_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_14_ITEM15_P243_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_14_ITEM15_P243_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_14_ITEM15_P243_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P243_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $18,678 and $16,608 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P244_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_14_ITEM15_P244_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_14_ITEM15_P244_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P244_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_14_ITEM15_P245_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_14_ITEM15_P245_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_14_ITEM15_P246_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_14_ITEM15_P246_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_14_ITEM15_P246_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_14_ITEM15_P246_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_14_ITEM15_P246_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P246_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $4,221 and $4,833 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P247_S0	In 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul's and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman's employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_14_ITEM15_P247_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_14_ITEM15_P247_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_14_ITEM15_P248_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_14_ITEM15_P248_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P249_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:
103730_14_ITEM15_P250_S0	The plan assets are stated at fair value.
103730_14_ITEM15_P250_S1	See Note 18 for further discussion of the valuation of the plan assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P251_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of the following:
103730_14_ITEM15_P252_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_14_ITEM15_P253_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the projected and accumulated benefit obligations:
103730_14_ITEM15_P254_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost:
103730_14_ITEM15_P255_S0	See Note 10 for the pretax, tax effect and after tax amounts included in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
103730_14_ITEM15_P255_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2014 is $9,900.
103730_14_ITEM15_P256_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_14_ITEM15_P257_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:
103730_14_ITEM15_P258_S0	The plans' expected return on assets is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_14_ITEM15_P258_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P259_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P260_S0	The Company's U.S. defined benefit plans are invested in diversified portfolios of public-market equity and fixed income securities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P260_S1	Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and, in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_14_ITEM15_P260_S2	The target allocation has historically been approximately 60% invested in equity securities and 40% invested in fixed income securities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P260_S3	Based on market interest rate conditions and the current market value of the plan assets at December 31, 2013, our qualified defined benefit plan in the U.S. is fully-funded.
103730_14_ITEM15_P260_S4	Accordingly, we have revised the asset allocation strategy for this plan to further reduce risk and now have set the target allocation at approximately 20% of the assets invested in equity securities and 80% invested in fixed income securities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P260_S5	The Company is evaluating options to further reduce the risk associated with its pension obligations.

103730_14_ITEM15_P261_S1	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P261_S2	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P261_S3	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P261_S4	See Note 18 for further information on the fair value of the plan assets by asset category.
103730_14_ITEM15_P262_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P263_S0	The Company anticipates making contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans of between $15,000 and $20,000 in 2014.
103730_14_ITEM15_P264_S0	The Company's anticipated 2014 contributions for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans will approximate the expected benefit payments disclosed above.
103730_14_ITEM15_P265_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains unfunded non-pension postretirement plans, including medical benefits for certain executives and their surviving spouses, which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_14_ITEM15_P265_S1	One of these plans was amended effective January 1, 2012, which reduced the benefit obligations of the Company.
103730_14_ITEM15_P265_S2	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P266_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and accrued benefit cost related to U.S. and non-U.S. non-pension defined benefit postretirement plans:

103730_14_ITEM15_P269_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost:
103730_14_ITEM15_P270_S0	The estimated actuarial items for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2014 are not material and approximate the amounts amortized in 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P271_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_14_ITEM15_P272_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012:
103730_14_ITEM15_P273_S0	The impact of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation is not material.
103730_14_ITEM15_P274_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_14_ITEM15_P275_S0	As the plans are unfunded, the Company's anticipated contributions for 2014 are equal to its estimated benefits payments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P276_S0	The Company participates in various other defined contribution and government-mandated retirement plans based on local law or custom.
103730_14_ITEM15_P276_S1	The Company periodically makes required contributions for certain of these plans, whereas other plans are unfunded retirement bonus plans which will be paid at the employee's retirement date.
103730_14_ITEM15_P276_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the consolidated balance sheets include $(14,017) and $(12,347), respectively, within accrued pension and other postretirement costs related to these plans.
103730_14_ITEM15_P277_S0	Many of the Company's U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, some of which provide for Company matching under various formulas.

103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S0	Certain key employees participate in a deferred compensation plan.
103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, these employees could defer a portion of their compensation until retirement, or elect shorter deferral periods.
103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S2	The Company maintains a liability within other noncurrent liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets related to these deferrals.
103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S3	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund payments under this plan.
103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S4	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S5	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P278_S6	Assets held in trust related to the deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $14,093 and $12,310, respectively.

103730_14_ITEM15_P281_S0	The amount of compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
103730_14_ITEM15_P281_S1	The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
103730_14_ITEM15_P281_S2	The Company determines compensation cost for RSUs, phantom stock units, and restricted stock based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P281_S3	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_14_ITEM15_P282_S0	The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense recognized:
103730_14_ITEM15_P283_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for RSUs that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.

103730_14_ITEM15_P283_S2	$1,778 of these reversed costs had been originally reported as a separate line item upon cessation of employment of certain former executives in 2011, and accordingly, this adjustment is also reported as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P284_S0	A portion of the stock-based compensation expense related to certain current executives that was reversed in the second fiscal quarter of 2013 was recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 due to certain amendments to the performance-based RSUs granted to certain current executives in 2011 approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Director's in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P284_S1	Pursuant to their original terms, the performance-based RSUs would vest on January 1, 2014 only if all of the associated performance criteria were met for the three-year period ending December 31, 2013.
103730_14_ITEM15_P284_S2	Pursuant to the amended terms, 75% of the performance-based RSUs of each of the certain current executives vested effective December 5, 2013 in light of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Director's assessment that the performance criteria would be achieved in substantial part by December 31, 2013.

103730_14_ITEM15_P289_S1	The amendment eliminated share recycling, so that on the exercise of an option where the exercise price is paid via the tender of previously-owned shares or pursuant to an "immaculate cashless exercise," the total "gross" number of option shares exercised is removed from the pool of shares available for future issuance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P289_S2	Similarly, shares withheld to pay income taxes in connection with the exercise of an option are also removed from the pool.
103730_14_ITEM15_P289_S3	The amendment also restricts re-pricing and cash repurchases of options without the prior approval of stockholders.
103730_14_ITEM15_P289_S4	The 2007 Program was subsequently re-approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2013 Annual Stockholders Meeting held on May 23, 2013.

103730_14_ITEM15_P293_S1	As a result of the acquisition, each outstanding option to acquire General Semiconductor common stock became exercisable for shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P293_S2	Based on the conversion ratio in the acquisition of 0.563 of a Vishay share for each General Semiconductor share, the former General Semiconductor options become exercisable in the aggregate for 4,282,000 shares of Vishay common stock on the date of the acquisition.
103730_14_ITEM15_P293_S3	All such options were immediately vested and exercisable as a result of the merger but the terms of the options otherwise remained unchanged.
103730_14_ITEM15_P293_S4	As of November 2, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the acquisition, no options related to this plan were outstanding and no additional options may be granted from this plan.

103730_14_ITEM15_P298_S0	The pretax aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the closing stock price on the last trading day of 2013 of $13.26 per share and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2013 is $17.
103730_14_ITEM15_P298_S1	This amount changes based on changes in the market value of the Company's common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P298_S2	No options were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2013.

103730_14_ITEM15_P331_S1	The royalty was payable in the event Dr. Zandman was terminated without "cause" or resigned for "good reason," as defined in the 2004 Agreement.
103730_14_ITEM15_P331_S2	This provision was carried over from Dr. Zandman's original employment agreement of March 1985, and could not be modified or eliminated without Dr. Zandman's consent.
103730_14_ITEM15_P331_S3	It was a reflection, among other things, of Dr. Zandman's key role in the founding of the Company and in creating, developing and commercializing the Company's technologies and the absence of any compensation to Dr. Zandman for the core intellectual property that he contributed to the Company over the years from its inception.
103730_14_ITEM15_P332_S0	The Company engaged a consultant in 2007 to assist its evaluation of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment to be terminated.
103730_14_ITEM15_P332_S1	Based in part upon the work of this consultant and management's own updated computations, management estimated that the present value of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment terminated at December 31, 2008 would have been between approximately $ 370,000 and $ 445,000 , with a possible tax gross-up if the royalties were payable in connection with a change of control and deemed subject to an excise tax.
103730_14_ITEM15_P333_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Dr. Zandman's right to the royalty payments was terminated.
103730_14_ITEM15_P333_S1	Dr. Zandman received a payment of $10,000 as of the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, and his estate is entitled to receive annual payments of $10,000 each through 2014.
103730_14_ITEM15_P333_S2	Dr. Zandman's passing in June 2011 had no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P333_S3	The Company recognized the compensation expense equal to the present value of these payments in 2009.
103730_14_ITEM15_P333_S4	The Company recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge.
103730_14_ITEM15_P333_S5	At December 31, 2013, the Company had approximately $10,000 accrued in other accrued expenses for this liability.
103730_14_ITEM15_P334_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense of $3,889 reported as a component of the executive compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 for other elements of compensation that accelerated upon the passing of Dr. Zandman.
103730_14_ITEM15_P335_S0	The Company recognized compensation expense of $1,873 reported as a component of the executive compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 for elements of compensation payable to the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Lior Yahalomi, in connection with his resignation.
103730_14_ITEM15_P336_S0	The Company recognized a credit of $1,778 reported as the executive compensation credit in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 for the reversal of stock-based compensation expense previously recorded for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest to Dr. Zandman's estate and Dr. Lior Yahalomi on January 1, 2014 at the time it was determined that achievement of the performance-based vesting criteria was no longer probable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P337_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of net revenues, a material portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, automotive, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P337_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_14_ITEM15_P337_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company's products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
103730_14_ITEM15_P338_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_14_ITEM15_P338_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P338_S2	As of December 31, 2013, one customer comprised 13.9% of the Company's accounts receivable balance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P338_S3	This customer comprised 14.7% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM15_P338_S4	No other customer comprised greater than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2013 or December 31, 2012.
103730_14_ITEM15_P339_S0	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_14_ITEM15_P339_S1	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P340_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P340_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_14_ITEM15_P340_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_14_ITEM15_P341_S0	Many of the Company's products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_14_ITEM15_P341_S1	The Company's consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_14_ITEM15_P341_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company's customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_14_ITEM15_P341_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net earnings.
103730_14_ITEM15_P342_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum.
103730_14_ITEM15_P343_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P343_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_14_ITEM15_P344_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_14_ITEM15_P344_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company's ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_14_ITEM15_P344_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company's ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company's products.
103730_14_ITEM15_P345_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_14_ITEM15_P345_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company's policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_14_ITEM15_P345_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P346_S0	Recently enacted rules in the U.S. on conflict minerals, which include tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold, all of which are used in the Company's products, could result in increased prices and decreased supply of conflict minerals, which could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P347_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 75% of revenues earned during 2013 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_14_ITEM15_P347_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, $1,132,079 of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_14_ITEM15_P347_S2	Some of the Company's products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_14_ITEM15_P347_S3	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_14_ITEM15_P347_S4	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_14_ITEM15_P348_S0	As of December 31, 2013 the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_14_ITEM15_P349_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 43 years.
103730_14_ITEM15_P349_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_14_ITEM15_P350_S0	Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_14_ITEM15_P351_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ("segment operating income").
103730_14_ITEM15_P351_S1	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_14_ITEM15_P351_S2	The Company's calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains and losses on sales of property, and other items.
103730_14_ITEM15_P351_S3	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_14_ITEM15_P351_S4	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_14_ITEM15_P352_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_14_ITEM15_P353_S0	The Company has also disclosed certain additional items not used to evaluate segment performance.
103730_14_ITEM15_P353_S1	In some cases, the items are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are required to be disclosed by GAAP.
103730_14_ITEM15_P353_S2	Additionally, the additional segment disclosures may provide insight to the Company's future profitability by reportable segment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P354_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_14_ITEM15_P355_S0	See Note 4 for restructuring and severance costs segment information.
103730_14_ITEM15_P356_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_14_ITEM15_P357_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, Vishay made changes to its business model to streamline its sales process such that three main subsidiaries generate the majority of third-party sales.
103730_14_ITEM15_P358_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_14_ITEM15_P359_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_14_ITEM15_P359_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), warrants (see Note 7), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P360_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM15_P361_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_14_ITEM15_P362_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_14_ITEM15_P363_S0	The Company's convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_14_ITEM15_P363_S1	While none of these events has occurred as of December 31, 2013, certain conditions which could trigger conversion have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_14_ITEM15_P364_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_14_ITEM15_P364_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the "treasury stock method" (similar to options and warrants) rather than the "if converted method" otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_14_ITEM15_P364_S2	Under the "treasury stock method," Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the debentures based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_14_ITEM15_P364_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.88 , no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $19.02 , no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $11.81 , no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2042.
103730_14_ITEM15_P365_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_14_ITEM15_P366_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_14_ITEM15_P366_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_14_ITEM15_P366_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_14_ITEM15_P367_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_14_ITEM15_P368_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_14_ITEM15_P368_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_14_ITEM15_P369_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions.
103730_14_ITEM15_P370_S0	An asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_14_ITEM15_P371_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012:
103730_14_ITEM15_P372_S0	The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as "rabbi" trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans.
103730_14_ITEM15_P372_S1	Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale, and company-owned life insurance assets.
103730_14_ITEM15_P372_S2	The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P372_S3	The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company's insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts.
103730_14_ITEM15_P372_S4	The fair value measurement of the marketable securities held in the rabbi trust is considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P373_S0	The Company maintains defined benefit retirement plans in certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_14_ITEM15_P373_S1	The assets of the plans are measured at fair value.
103730_14_ITEM15_P374_S0	Equity securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of various mutual funds and exchange traded funds that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P374_S1	The fair value measurement of the mutual funds and exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P375_S0	Fixed income securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of exchange traded funds, investments in a group annuity contract, and a short-term investment fund.
103730_14_ITEM15_P375_S1	The exchange traded funds are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P375_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P376_S0	The group annuity contract consists of a general asset account and a pooled separate account.
103730_14_ITEM15_P376_S1	Units of the general asset account are valued based on a discounted cash flow model using the current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations and similar credit risk.
103730_14_ITEM15_P376_S2	The pooled separate accounts are valued based on the value of the underlying bond funds, which are valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year, with adjustments made to reflect the nature of how the investment is held.
103730_14_ITEM15_P377_S0	The fair value measurement of the group annuity contract is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P378_S0	The short-term investment fund strictly invests in short-term investments, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, U.S. government obligations, corporate notes, and funding agreements.
103730_14_ITEM15_P378_S1	The maturity date of all investments held by the short-term investment fund is within one year from the financial statement date.
103730_14_ITEM15_P378_S2	There are no redemption restrictions on the plan's investment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P379_S0	The fair value of the short-term investment fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investment.
103730_14_ITEM15_P379_S1	The fair value measurement of the short-term investment fund is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P380_S0	Real estate investments held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of real estate investment trust securities that are valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P380_S1	The fair value measurement of the real estate investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P381_S0	Equity securities held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of equity securities that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P381_S1	The fair value measurement of the equity securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P382_S0	Fixed income securities held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of government bonds in the Philippines and India and corporate notes that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P382_S1	The fair value measurement of the fixed income securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P383_S0	Cash held by the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consists of demand deposits on account in various financial institutions to fund current benefit payments.
103730_14_ITEM15_P383_S1	The carrying amount of the cash approximates its fair value.
103730_14_ITEM15_P384_S0	The Company holds available for sale investments in debt securities that are intended to fund a portion of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_14_ITEM15_P384_S1	The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_14_ITEM15_P384_S2	The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P385_S0	The convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, issued by the Company on November 9, 2010, May 13, 2011, and May 31, 2012, respectively, contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period.
103730_14_ITEM15_P385_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_14_ITEM15_P386_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_14_ITEM15_P386_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company's current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures' credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_14_ITEM15_P386_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management's judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P387_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_14_ITEM15_P388_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability, at December 31, 2013 and 2012 is approximately $750,700 and $686,800, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability, of $363,874 and $391,628, respectively.
103730_14_ITEM15_P388_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P389_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
103730_14_ITEM15_P389_S1	The short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
103730_14_ITEM15_P389_S2	The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity.
103730_14_ITEM15_P390_S0	At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary.
103730_14_ITEM15_P390_S1	No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented.
103730_14_ITEM15_P390_S2	There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification.
103730_14_ITEM15_P390_S3	All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities' maturity dates.
103730_14_ITEM15_P391_S0	Interest on the securities is recognized as interest income when earned.
103730_14_ITEM15_P392_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were comprised of demand deposits, time deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased, and money market funds.
103730_14_ITEM15_P392_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs.
103730_14_ITEM15_P392_S2	Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets.

103730_14_ITEM15_P395_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_14_ITEM15_P396_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG and Vishay operate separately, each as independent public companies.
103730_14_ITEM15_P396_S1	Vishay Intertechnology has no ownership interest in VPG.
103730_14_ITEM15_P396_S2	However, Ruta Zandman, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman and Ziv Shoshani, all of whom are members of Vishay's Board of Directors, control a large portion of the voting power of both Vishay and VPG.
103730_14_ITEM15_P396_S3	Marc Zandman, Vishay's Executive Chairman of the Board and an executive officer of Vishay, serves as the Chairman of VPG.
103730_14_ITEM15_P396_S4	Ziv Shoshani, CEO of VPG, serves as a director of Vishay.

103730_14_ITEM15_P397_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.

103730_14_ITEM15_P398_S0	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term "Vishay" in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay's product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_14_ITEM15_P398_S1	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_14_ITEM15_P399_S0	Until the spin-off, VPG was included in Vishay's consolidated federal income tax returns and with Vishay and/or certain of Vishay's subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.

103730_14_ITEM15_P399_S2	Vishay is also principally responsible for managing any income tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions for pre-spin-off periods.
103730_14_ITEM15_P399_S3	Vishay has fully indemnified VPG of tax exposures arising prior to the spin-off.
103730_14_ITEM15_P400_S0	Due to the common board members, transition services agreement, lease and supply agreements, and trademark license agreements with VPG, which, in the aggregate, represent significant continuing involvement, Vishay did not restate prior periods to present VPG as a discontinued operation upon completion of the spin-off.
103730_14_ITEM15_P400_S1	VPG's results are not included in Vishay's consolidated statements of operations, statements of cash flows, or balance sheets for any periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

103730_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	In the 1950's, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with a loan from the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	These products were included with the measurements and foil resistor businesses that we spun off into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("Vishay Precision Group" or "VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders on July 6, 2010.
103730_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	In the early 1990's, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay's global market position in passive components.
103730_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011; HiRel Systems in 2012; MCB Industrie in 2013; and Holy Stone Polytech in 2014.

103730_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	We often target high margin niche business acquisitions, such as Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, and MCB Industrie, we acquired in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	In 2014, we made strategic acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech and Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P15_S5	The technology and design capabilities acquired in these acquisitions are expected to drive growth of our tantalum capacitor and optoelectronic components businesses.
103730_15_ITEM1_P15_S6	These acquisitions accounted for 4.8% of 2014 revenues.
103730_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 18 years and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 13 years.
103730_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures in prior periods and continued cost control activities (see "Cost Management" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") to contribute to our "free cash" generation going forward.
103730_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2014, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $652 million.
103730_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $640 million through August 8, 2018, of which $432 million was available as of December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong "free cash" flow generation provide financial strength and flexibility and reduce our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by fluctuating consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, modify existing products, respond to technological change, and customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have licenses to use, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
103730_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We plan to continue to use our research and development ("R D"), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	As part of our plan to foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by approximately 20% since 2009 and plan to further increase it.
103730_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase opportunities to design-in our products in local markets.

103730_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by United States government agencies, and under certain European military specifications.
103730_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_15_ITEM1_P57_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product's classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed "dies" or "chips") on each wafer.
103730_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed "packages") that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_15_ITEM1_P61_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel.
103730_15_ITEM1_P62_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Dominican Republic, Japan, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_15_ITEM1_P62_S5	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The majority of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification and others are actively pursuing such approval.
103730_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Certain materials, in addition to tantalum and including tin, tungsten, and gold are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers, the source for which may be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country.
103730_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	We are working toward the elimination of materials that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries from our supply chain.
103730_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2014 is shown below:
103730_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers' specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating pricing and contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer's business requirements.
103730_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ("FAEs") to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers' engineering needs.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay "design-in" the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_15_ITEM1_P80_S6	Our 2014 acquisition of Capella greatly increased our in-house design capabilities, particularly for optoelectronic components.
103730_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_15_ITEM1_P81_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People's Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:
103730_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	MOSFETs: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Diodes: Diodes, Inc., Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics.
103730_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	Optoelectronic Components: Avago, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors, Rohm, Sharp, Toshiba.
103730_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	Resistors and Inductors: KOA, Murata, Panasonic, Rohm, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Capacitors: AVX, KEMET, Murata, Nichicon, Panasonic, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	There are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete.
103730_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability, technological innovation, business reputation, and price competitiveness.
103730_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity's or individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 22,600 full time employees, of whom approximately 89% were located outside the United States.
103730_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM1_P101_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_15_ITEM1_P105_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_15_ITEM1_P105_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_15_ITEM1_P105_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_15_ITEM1_P106_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM1_P106_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_15_ITEM1_P106_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_15_ITEM1_P106_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_15_ITEM1_P107_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_15_ITEM1_P107_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_15_ITEM1_P107_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_15_ITEM1_P108_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and the periods of decline we recently experienced may resume and may become more pronounced.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	While we believe that a recovery from the recent global downturn is underway, there is no assurance that the recovery will continue at its current pace or at all, or that the conditions that contributed to the recent recessionary environment have in fact abated.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A decline in product demand on a global basis could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and will continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to achieve synergies, eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions, and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The programs primarily focus on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees company-wide.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also plan to implement two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The expenses associated with the programs have been and will continue to be recorded as they become recognizable under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
103730_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are subject to various U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations that may affect our ability to complete certain acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, or we cannot effectively mitigate the assumed, contingent, and unknown liabilities acquired, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Certain acquisitions will increase the risks inherent in our business.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our acquisition of Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. is unique compared to our past acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Most of our previous acquisitions were established businesses with substantial tangible assets.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a fabless design business, most of the assets acquired in the Capella transaction are intangible.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If the acquired business does not perform as expected, we may be required to record impairment charges related to those intangible assets, with limited ability to monetize any of those assets.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	There are significant risks specific to the acquired business that could result in it not performing as expected.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As a fabless design business, Capella is substantially dependent on independent third-party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture its products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If Capella cannot obtain sufficient capacity commitments, if Capella's foundries and subcontractors suffer financial instability, liquidity issues, or insolvency proceedings affecting their ability to manufacture our products, or if Capella's foundries and subcontractors experience production delays for other reasons, the supply of its products could be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If demand for its products increases significantly, we have no assurances that Capella's third-party foundries and subcontractors will be able to increase their manufacturing capacity to a level that meets our requirements, potentially preventing us from meeting our customer demand and harming our business and customer relationships.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Also, even if Capella's foundries and subcontractors are able to meet our increased demand, those third-party manufacturers may decide to charge significantly higher wafer prices to us, which could reduce our gross margin or require us to offset the increased prices by increasing prices to our customers, either of which could harm our business and operating results.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Capella's future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We could be materially adversely affected if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increases significantly or we are unsuccessful in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified personnel.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Should we lose one or more engineers who are key to a project's completion during the course of a particular project, the completion of such project may be delayed which could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Capella's historical customer base is concentrated among a few key customers, and is focused on end-users in the consumer products industry.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The delay, significant reduction in, or loss of, orders from these large customers or the consumer products industry, or demands of price concessions from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations, or could result in significant volatility in our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $455 million as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock, and borrowings to fund the Capella acquisition in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P27_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P30_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P33_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the recent period of economic slowdown.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately reflects the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P45_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 76% of our revenues during 2014 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 44 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Except for the distinct and targeted restructuring programs announced in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, we do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P64_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Approximately 99% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As of December 31, 2014, $1,100 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We expect to fund the quarterly dividend program initiated in February 2014, by, at least in part, repatriating current year income of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and providing appropriate U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable on that current period non-U.S. income.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	At the present time, we expect that cash and profits generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries prior to 2014, and cash generated in 2014 which is not funding the dividend program or the Capella acquisition, will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries .
103730_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	At December 31, 2014, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 47.3% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P70_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P70_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of approximately 89.4% of our Class B common stock and 42.4% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Some or all of our holders of Class B common stock may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P74_S3	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P76_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P76_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name .
103730_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the "Vishay" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the "Vishay" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2014, our business had 50 manufacturing locations.
103730_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.
103730_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some locations include both owned and leased facilities in the same location.
103730_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	The list of manufacturing facilities below excludes manufacturing facilities that are presently idle due to our restructuring activities.
103730_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment generally are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs.
103730_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	Owning many of our manufacturing facilities provides us meaningful financial and operating benefits, including long-term stability and a necessary buffer for economic downturns.
103730_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
103730_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	The principal locations of our owned manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	The principal locations of our leased manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Since July 18, 2014, the Company has been named as a defendant in purported antitrust class action complaints in the United States and Canada.
103730_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaints allege restraints of trade in aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors, and in some cases, film capacitors, by the Company and other manufacturers, and seek injunctive relief and unspecified joint and several treble damages.
103730_15_ITEM3_P1_S2	The complaints in the United States have been consolidated into complaints from direct and indirect purchasers.
103730_15_ITEM3_P1_S3	In the consolidated U.S. complaints, the Company was only named in the direct purchaser complaint, In Re: Capacitors Antitrust Litigation , before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
103730_15_ITEM3_P1_S4	In December 2014, Vishay, along with the other defendants, filed motions to dismiss the consolidated direct purchaser complaint.
103730_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	Purported antitrust class action complaints have been filed against the Company in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.
103730_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company intends to defend vigorously against the complaints.
103730_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_15_ITEM3_P3_S3	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
103730_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_15_ITEM3_P4_S1	During the past few years, we settled several suits which we had initiated to enforce our intellectual property rights.
103730_15_ITEM3_P4_S2	We are receiving royalties on sales of these companies' products which use our technology.
103730_15_ITEM3_P4_S3	We are continuing to assert our legal rights against other parties which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights.
103730_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	Vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by Vishay and its subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_15_ITEM3_P6_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM3_P7_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_15_ITEM3_P7_S1	See also Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

103730_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape for the indicated fiscal quarters.
103730_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	Holders of record of our common stock totaled approximately 1,000 at February 16, 2015.
103730_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.
103730_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, the high and low sales prices of our common stock.
103730_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	At February 16, 2015, we had outstanding 12,129,227 shares of Class B common stock, par value $.10 per share, each of which entitles the holder to ten votes.
103730_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Class B common stock generally is not transferable except in certain very limited instances, and there is no market for those shares.
103730_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The Class B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock on a share for share basis.
103730_15_ITEM5_P4_S2	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of approximately 89.4% of our Class B common stock and 42.4% of the total voting power of our capital stock.
103730_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	On February 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors instituted a quarterly cash dividend program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	Cash dividends of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid on March 27, 2014, June 26, 2014, September 18, 2014, and December 16, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2014, June 12, 2014, August 28, 2014, and November 26, 2014, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM5_P5_S2	We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although the amount and timing of any future dividends remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following table summarizes the quarterly cash dividends declared (in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	Certain of our debt obligations contain restrictions as to the payment of cash dividends.
103730_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	The line graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Vishay's common stock over a 5-year period with the returns on the Standard Poor's MidCap 400 Stock Index (of which Vishay is a component), the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index, and a peer group of companies selected by our management.
103730_15_ITEM5_P8_S1	The peer group is made up of five publicly-held manufacturers of semiconductors, resistors, capacitors, and other electronic components.
103730_15_ITEM5_P8_S2	Management believes that the product offerings of the companies contained in the peer group are more similar to our product offerings than those of the companies contained in any published industry index.
103730_15_ITEM5_P9_S0	The return of each peer issuer has been weighted according to the respective issuer's stock market capitalization.
103730_15_ITEM5_P9_S1	The line graph assumes that $100 had been invested at December 31, 2009 and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
103730_15_ITEM5_P9_S2	The cash equivalent of the shares received in the spin-off of VPG is included in Vishay's results below.
103730_15_ITEM5_P10_S0	* AVX Corporation, Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc., KEMET Corporation, and ON Semiconductor Corporation.

103730_15_ITEM6_P2_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.02 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.

103730_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) Includes the results of HiRel Systems LLC from January 13, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	Also includes net pretax gain on the sale of property in Belgium vacated as a result of restructuring in prior years of $12,153,000 and a $4,036,000 one-time tax benefit related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances in Israel following a merger of several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits.
103730_15_ITEM6_P3_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.08 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.

103730_15_ITEM6_P4_S2	Also includes $10,024,000 of one-time tax expense related to the write-down of deferred tax assets in Israel to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate enacted in January 2011 on certain types of income earned after December 31, 2010 and $6,538,000 of one-time tax benefits recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances in various jurisdictions.
103730_15_ITEM6_P4_S3	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a negative $0.04 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as businesses that have been spun off, restructuring and severance costs, material pension settlement charges, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains and losses on sales of property, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Discrete semiconductors and passive components manufactured by Vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronic products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	We operate in five product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have repurchased 44.3 million shares of our common stock since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, representing 24% of our shares outstanding before we began this initiative.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	The exchange of $56.4 million principal amount of our exchangeable unsecured notes by a holder of the notes in the third fiscal quarter of 2013 increased the number of our common shares outstanding by 3.7 million, but did not affect the number of weighted average shares outstanding used for computing diluted earnings per share because our earnings per share computation assumes that the exchangeable unsecured notes would be converted.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	On February 3, 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	The permitted capacity to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends under our credit facility increases each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S6	At December 31, 2014, our total permitted capacity to repurchase shares of stock or pay dividends under our credit facility is $192.7 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P3_S7	Although we have no current plans, we will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	We continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	In response to the economic environment, we began implementing a targeted cost reduction program in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 to support our profitability without jeopardizing our growth plan.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	Complete implementation of the targeted cost reduction programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_15_ITEM7_P4_S6	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. ("Capella") for approximately NT$6,051 million or $205 million at then-current exchange rates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Capella is a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic sensors.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	As a first step in the acquisition, we launched a tender offer for Capella's oustanding shares.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	A total of 38,703,705 shares of Capella, or 88.95% of outstanding shares, were tendered and accepted by us.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	The offer period expired on September 1, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S5	Pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, we paid NT$139 for each share tendered.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S6	The aggregate purchase price for the tendered shares was NT$5,400 million, or approximately $180 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S7	We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella pursuant to the merger agreement on December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S8	Each remaining stockholder received the same NT$139 per share as merger consideration.
103730_15_ITEM7_P5_S9	The acquisition is expected to strengthen our position in optoelectronic sensors, a promising growth market.
103730_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, we executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with our U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	As a result of these transactions, the projected benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status were remeasured on the dates of the respective settlements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	These transactions reduced the U.S. projected benefit obligation by approximately $59.4 million, and were funded entirely with plan assets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	These transactions also resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15.6 million, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	These non-cash charges are presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	We continue to evaluate options to further reduce the risk associated with our pension obligations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net revenues decreased in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 versus the prior quarter and prior year quarter.
103730_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Net revenues for 2014 increased versus 2013 and operating results are close to our expectations at this relatively low revenue level.
103730_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	A decrease in orders in the latter part of 2014 resulted in a decrease in many key financial metrics compared to the prior quarters.
103730_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $2.493 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.371 billion and $2.230 billion for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $117.6 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $123.0 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, and $122.7 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 include items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliation below.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share do not have uniform definitions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_15_ITEM7_P12_S6	Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	* Includes add-back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive.
103730_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our results for 2012 - 2014 demonstrate our ability to react quickly to changing economic environments, successfully implement cost reduction measures when necessary to sustain earnings, and organically grow our business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Despite revenues below our expected run-rate, our pre-tax results were as we would expect based on our business model.
103730_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	We also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices ("ASP").
103730_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	We analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	(1) Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 and the first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2014 includes $2.8 million, $6.4 million, $9.0 million, $3.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of restructuring and severance expenses (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Operating margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2014 includes $15.6 million of U.S. pension settlement charges (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	(2) End of period backlog for the second fiscal quarter of 2014 reflects a total of $1.3 million related to the backlog of Holy Stone Polytech Co., Ltd. as of the date of acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	End of period backlog for the third fiscal quarter of 2014 reflects a total of $8.2 million related to the backlog of Capella as of the date of acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	See "Financial Metrics by Segment" below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Revenues decreased sequentially versus the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The order level through 2014 was higher than the level experienced in the latter half of 2013, but decreased at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2014 and continued to weaken in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 before showing signs of a possible recovery.
103730_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	The decrease in orders was primarily due to a decrease in demand from distributors, particularly in Asia.
103730_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	Currency effects also decreased fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 revenues by $12 million versus the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	Average selling prices continue to decline primarily due to our commodity semiconductor products and the effects of growing our Resistors Inductors business in Asia.
103730_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Gross margins decreased versus the third fiscal quarter of 2014, but remain steady versus the prior year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease versus the third fiscal quarter of 2014 is primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices and reduced volume.
103730_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Gross margins have been negatively impacted by additional depreciation associated with our cost reduction programs beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 and will continue to be negatively impacted until the complete implementation of our cost reduction programs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The book-to-bill ratio increased to 0.95 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 from 0.91 in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 0.93 and 0.96, respectively, versus ratios of 0.86 and 0.97, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our existing product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA").
103730_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay's four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, an average of approximately $100 million of revenues per year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions with a purchase price larger than $500 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	On June 11, 2014, we acquired Holy Stone Polytech Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone Polytech" or "Vishay Polytech Co. Ltd."), a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20.6 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The acquisition is expected to strengthen our position in tantalum capacitors, especially in Asia.
103730_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations of Holy Stone Polytech have been included in the Capacitors segment since June 11, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire Capella for approximately NT$6,051 million or $205 million at then-current exchange rates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Capella is a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic sensors that was publicly traded in Taiwan.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	As a first step in the acquisition, we launched a tender offer for Capella's outstanding shares.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	A total of 38,703,705 shares of Capella, or 88.95% of outstanding shares, were tendered and accepted by us.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	The offer period expired on September 1, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	Pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, Vishay paid NT$139 for each share tendered.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S6	The aggregate purchase price for tendered shares was NT$5,400 million, or approximately $180 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S7	Capella had cash and short-term investments on hand of $50 million at the date of acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P39_S8	The acquisition is expected to strengthen our position in optoelectronic sensors, a promising growth market.
103730_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella pursuant to the merger agreement on December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	In connection with closing of the merger, all remaining holders of Capella common stock other than Vishay and our subsidiaries received the same consideration for their shares as the holders who tendered their shares in the tender offer, or approximately $21 million in the aggregate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Upon the close of the tender offer, we controlled Capella and began consolidating it in our financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations of Capella have been included in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The interest of the shares not tendered are presented as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements for the period from the conclusion of the tender offer until they were acquired on December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	We funded the acquisition mostly with cash on-hand, and borrowed $53 million on our revolving credit facility to achieve future flexibility given the legal entity and financial structure utilized for the acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Capella on December 31, 2014, we expect to repatriate cash from current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Due to the nature of Capella's business, $74.5 million of the purchase price is allocated to definite-lived intangible assets, which will result in yearly amortization expense of the intangible assets of approximately $10 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	On June 13, 2013, we acquired MCB Industrie S.A. ("MCB Industrie") in France, a well-established manufacturer of specialty resistors and sensors, for $23.0 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired is expected to enable us to expand our presence in the European industrial market.
103730_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from June 13, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	On January 13, 2012, we acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for approximately $85.5 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired further enhance our inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from January 13, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs, and use various measures and metrics to evaluate our cost structure.
103730_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	We define variable costs as expenses that vary with respect to quantity produced.
103730_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Fixed costs do not vary with respect to quantity produced over the relevant time period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Contributive margin is calculated as net revenue less variable costs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	It may be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of net revenue.
103730_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Management uses this measure to determine the amount of profit to be expected for any change in revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	While these measures are typical cost accounting measures, none of these measures are recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	The classification of expenses as either variable or fixed is judgmental and other companies might classify such expenses differently.
103730_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	We closely monitor variable costs and seek to achieve the contributive margin in our business model.
103730_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Over a period of many years, we have generally maintained a contributive margin of between 46% - 48% of revenues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The erosion of average selling prices, particularly of our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry and inflation negatively impact contributive margin and drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our variable cost reduction efforts include increasing the efficiency in our production facilities by expending capital for automation, reducing materials costs, materials substitution, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs recorded as costs of products sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses and maintaining our break-even point (adjusted for acquisitions).
103730_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	We seek to limit increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses to the rate of inflation, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	At constant fixed costs, we would expect each $1 million increase in revenues to increase our operating margin by approximately $460,000 to $480,000.
103730_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	Sudden changes in the business conditions, however, may not allow us to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity and cost structure.
103730_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Between 2001 and 2009, we recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs totaling $320 million and related asset write-downs totaling $89 million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward.
103730_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	We also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	We did not initiate any new restructuring projects in 2010, 2011, or 2012 and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during such periods.
103730_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Occasionally, our ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate and we must take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness.
103730_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	We recorded $20.9 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2014 for the expenses that were recognizable under GAAP during the period and $23.7 million of restructuring and severance expenses since the cost reduction programs were implemented.
103730_15_ITEM7_P54_S4	The remaining expenses associated with the programs will be recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The programs primarily focus on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees Company-wide.
103730_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	We also plan to implement two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	The programs in total are expected to lower costs by approximately $36 million per year when fully implemented at expected cash costs of approximately $32 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The project for the MOSFETs segment will extend over a period of approximately two years.
103730_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The manufacture of wafers for certain critical products will be transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	As a consequence, certain other wafer manufacturing currently occurring in-house will be transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The total cash costs associated with the MOSFETs initiatives, principally severance, are expected to be approximately $16 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Once fully implemented, we anticipate that the MOSFETs programs will result in an annual reduction in variable and fixed manufacturing costs of approximately $23 million at current volumes.
103730_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement offer has been made to employees worldwide who are eligible because they have met job classification, age, and/or years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The program benefits vary by country and job classification, but generally offer a cash loyalty bonus.
103730_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	All eligible employees have been identified.
103730_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement program will not impact manufacturing operations or our growth plan.
103730_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our named executive officers (as defined in our proxy statement) and certain other key employees, generally research, development, and engineering personnel, were not eligible for the voluntary separation / early retirement program.
103730_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The effective separation / retirement date for most eligible employees who accepted the offer was June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a transition period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The total costs associated with the voluntary separation / early retirement program are approximately $13.3 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	The Company anticipates that the program will result in an annual reduction in fixed costs of approximately $10 million, split approximately 35% in manufacturing and 65% in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Two other smaller cost reduction programs relate to the transfer of production of certain products within our Diodes segment, which were initiated in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Both programs are connected to production moves, in order to take advantage of lower labor costs in one program and from the consolidation of manufacturing locations in the other.
103730_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	The total cash costs associated with these production transfers are expected to be approximately $3 million, and will result in annual cost savings of approximately $3 million when fully implemented.
103730_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	Except for the distinct and targeted programs noted above, we do not anticipate any other material restructuring activities in 2015.
103730_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	As we have demonstrated the past three years, we believe that we can substantially maintain our trained workforce, even at lower manufacturing activity levels, by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	However, a continued sluggish business environment for the electronics industry or the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	We have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to our acquisitions of Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, LLC, MCB Industrie, Holy Stone Polytech, or Capella, but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Even as we seek to manage our costs, we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	We plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	To foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by approximately 20% since 2009 and plan to further increase it; we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities; we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase our market access to the industrial segment and increase the design-in of our products in local markets; and we are directing increased funding and focus on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	These efforts as well as our broad and innovative product portfolio and strong position in distribution worldwide have us positioned very well in case of a dramatic upturn in the economy.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	Our growth plan also targets adding, through acquisitions, $100 million of revenues per year on average.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	Since 2011, we have acquired the specialty product businesses of Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, LLC, and MCB Industrie.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S6	In 2014, we made strategic acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech and Capella and plan to use the technology and engineering capabilities acquired to further grow our business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P65_S7	We continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities despite the current economic volatility.
103730_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	We occasionally use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the "functional currency" of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	A subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company's operations generally would have the parent company's currency as its functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The dollar fluctuated versus the Euro and other foreign currencies throughout 2014, but the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was relatively even compared to the prior year, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars having an immaterial effect on reported revenues and expenses versus the prior year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been slightly unfavorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk and forward contracts used to mitigate foreign currency risk.
103730_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Recording and monitoring of our sales accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_15_ITEM7_P76_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_15_ITEM7_P77_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our annual goodwill impairment test.
103730_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units required for a quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses.
103730_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	As of December 31, 2014, one customer comprised 14.7% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	This customer comprised 13.9% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our U.S. plans include a plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and various non-qualified plans.
103730_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	The table below summarizes information about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	This information should be read in conjunction with Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements (amounts in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for certain postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	We use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_15_ITEM7_P91_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	For our U.S. qualified plan, we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk.
103730_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	Based on current market interest rate conditions and the current market value of the plan assets, our qualified defined benefit plan in the U.S. is fully-funded.
103730_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	Accordingly, we have revised the asset allocation strategy for this plan with the intention of further reducing risk.
103730_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Non-qualified plans in the U.S. are considered by law to be unfunded.
103730_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	However, the Company maintains assets in a rabbi trust to fund benefit payments under certain of these plans.
103730_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	Some non-U.S. plans also informally fund their plans by holding certain available-for-sale investments.
103730_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P96_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_15_ITEM7_P96_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	The U.S. Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee issued new mortality tables and a new mortality improvement scale in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	The new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale are based on a recent study of mortality experience in the United States and reflect improved retiree longevity.
103730_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	The use of the new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale increased the Company's projected benefit obligations in the United States by approximately $24 million and will increase future net periodic pension cost due to higher amortization of actuarial items.
103730_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions will be required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	Accordingly, net periodic pension cost for U.S. plans no longer include any service cost.
103730_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, the Company executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with its U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	These transactions included the purchase of annuity contracts for approximately 700 participants pursuant to an arrangement inherited in a past acquisition and a special limited-time voluntary lump-sum payment offer to certain former employees who were deferred vested participants of the plan not currently receiving periodic payments of their pension benefit.
103730_15_ITEM7_P100_S2	A total of 800 participants accepted the voluntary lump-sum offer.
103730_15_ITEM7_P100_S3	The plan is no longer obligated to pay any benefits to the 1,500 participants covered by these two settlement transactions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P100_S4	These former participants represented approximately 23% of the total participants prior to executing these transactions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P100_S5	These transactions also resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15.6 million, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	We continue to seek to de-risk our pension exposures, especially given the frozen status of the U.S. plans and the current funded status.
103730_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	Such actions could result in increased net periodic pension cost due to lower expected rates of return on plan assets and/or possible additional charges to recognize unamortized actuarial items if all or a portion of the obligations were to be settled.
103730_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	See Note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our income tax policies.
103730_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	We and our subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	In 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examination of our U.S. federal tax returns through the 2011 tax year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	The tax returns of principal non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include France (2012 and 2013), Germany (2009 through 2012), India (2004 through 2012), Israel (2009 through 2012), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2012).
103730_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	We and our subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_15_ITEM7_P105_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	We have generally recognized net deferred tax assets only where there is a recent history of taxable income and forecasts of future taxable income.
103730_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our provision for income taxes is based on various assertions regarding future use of that cash and profits.
103730_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	Such assertions require us to consider a wide variety of U.S. federal and foreign tax laws, and the application of such laws to our operational and strategic needs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	We expect to fund the quarterly dividend program initiated in February 2014, by, at least in part, repatriating current year income of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and providing appropriate U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable on that current period non-U.S. income.
103730_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	During 2014, we borrowed amounts on our revolving credit facility to achieve future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Capella on December 31, 2014, we expect to repatriate cash from current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes all U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable related to that anticipated transaction.
103730_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Substantially all earnings generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries prior to 2014, and cash generated in 2014 which is not funding the dividend program or the Capella acquisition, are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	During 2014, certain tax examinations were completed and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes tax benefits related to the resolution of these matters.
103730_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	Statement of operations' captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Overall, the business conditions in 2014 were better than the 2013 conditions, but both years were below our expected run-rate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Our revenue results for 2014 were positively affected by increased demand for our products and overall higher demand compared to the prior year periods.
103730_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Orders from distributors, particularly in Asia, decreased at the end of the year before showing signs of a possible recovery.
103730_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_15_ITEM7_P117_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $89.6 million, $84.3 million, and $72.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.5%, 3.4%, and 3.2%, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P117_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were approximately $87.9 million, $83.2 million, and $76.9 million, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P117_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $4.5 million, $6.4 million, and $7.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 24.5%, as compared to 23.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher volume and our cost reduction efforts partially offset by lower average selling prices.
103730_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 23.9%, as compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher volume partially offset by lower average selling prices.
103730_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the MOSFETs segment was as follows:
103730_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	In 2014, the MOSFETs segment continued to regain volume that was lost in 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	The growth was mainly achieved in the first half of the year while it stagnated towards the latter half of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	The increase in volume was primarily due to increased demand from distributors in Asia.
103730_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	Gross profit margin remains below expectations and decreased even further in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	The increase in volume, lower materials prices, and other cost reduction measures could not fully offset the decrease in average selling prices, the negative effect of additional depreciation associated with our cost reduction program, and general cost inflation.
103730_15_ITEM7_P126_S2	Overall the gross margin results were similar to 2013 with the additional negative effect of a full year of additional depreciation further impacting 2014 results.
103730_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Typical pricing pressure for our established MOSFETs products continues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	We have experienced significant declines in average selling prices in both 2014 versus 2013 and 2013 versus 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	In both years, the decline was partially due to lower materials prices.
103730_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	In 2013, we announced a cost reduction program to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	We continue to implement the program, which is long-term in nature and will not provide significant improvement until the program is close to full implementation.
103730_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	We continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the MOSFETs segment and continue to make capital and R D investments in this business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Diodes segment was as follows:
103730_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Diodes segment was positively affected by the increased demand from distributors in Asia in both 2014 and 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	Positive business development directly with end customers in Europe also contributed to growth of the segment in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P133_S2	The increases in gross profit margin in 2014 and 2013 are primarily due to the increase in sales volume, manufacturing efficiencies, and lower materials prices, partially offset by decreased average selling prices and general cost inflation.
103730_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	Typical pricing pressure for our established Diodes products continues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	We have experienced a slight price decline in 2014 versus 2013 and moderate price decline in 2013 versus 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	The cost reduction programs announced in 2013 include two smaller projects to improve the results of the Diodes segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P135_S1	These projects, which were initiated in the third fiscal quarter of 2014 and substantially implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014, demonstrate our ongoing effort to improve the results of this segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Optoelectronic Components segment was as follows:
103730_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment continued to increase its growth in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	The growth is primarily due to growth in distributor sales especially in Asia but also in Europe.
103730_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	In addition, the Capella acquisition contributed to the increase in revenues (see below).
103730_15_ITEM7_P139_S3	The increase in gross profit margin in 2014 versus 2013 is due to increases in volume, lower materials prices, and positive exchange rate effects, partially offset by lower average selling prices and general cost inflation.
103730_15_ITEM7_P139_S4	The increase in gross profit margin in 2013 versus 2012 is due to increases in volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
103730_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	Typical pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products continues.
103730_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	In both 2014 and 2013 we experienced slight declines in average selling prices versus the prior years.
103730_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	In 2014, we acquired Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic products, in a two step transaction completed on December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	Capella is included in the Optoelectronic Components segment results from the date we obtained control in September 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Resistors Inductors segment was as follows:
103730_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	The Resistors Inductors segment continues to produce strong results with revenues reaching an historically high level.
103730_15_ITEM7_P145_S1	All regions and most end-markets have contributed to the revenue growth compared to the prior year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P145_S2	The biggest source of growth was from distributors, and the automotive and industrial end-use markets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P145_S3	Sales to distributors were particularly strong in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 compared to prior years which experienced declines in sales in the fourth fiscal quarters.
103730_15_ITEM7_P145_S4	The segment's gross margin improved versus the prior year mainly due to efficiencies related to the higher sales volume and our continued cost reduction programs, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of reduced average selling prices and inflationary effects.
103730_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	Our targeted acquisitions of MCB Industrie, HiRel Systems, and certain assets of Huntington Electric in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, have positively contributed to the net revenues and gross margin of the Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	Average selling prices declined slightly in both 2014 versus 2013 and 2013 versus 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the Capacitors segment was as follows:
103730_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	Net revenues in 2014 decreased moderately versus the prior year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	The Capacitors segment continues to be negatively affected by low demand for renewable energies as government spending has declined.
103730_15_ITEM7_P152_S1	The automotive end-market has remained steady and sales increased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_15_ITEM7_P152_S2	The increase in gross profit margin versus the prior year is primarily due to the increase in average selling prices and cost reductions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P152_S3	The decrease in gross profit margin from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and average selling prices.
103730_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	Average selling prices increased slightly versus 2013, but remain lower than 2012 prices.
103730_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	On June 11, 2014, we acquired Holy Stone Polytech, a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20.6 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_15_ITEM7_P154_S1	The acquisition is expected to strengthen our position in tantalum capacitors, especially in Asia.
103730_15_ITEM7_P154_S2	We plan to use the technology acquired to develop new products and enter new product markets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	The overall increase in SG A expenses is primarily attributable to the non-repetition of temporary cost containment measures implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2013, SG A expenses of acquired companies, and additional compensation costs in general, partially offset by the benefits of our voluntary separation / early retirement program (see "Cost Management" above).
103730_15_ITEM7_P156_S1	We also incurred additional SG A expenses in 2014 to close the Holy Stone Polytech and Capella acquisitions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P156_S2	The overall increase in SG A expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to less austere temporary cost reduction programs implemented in 2013 versus 2012 due to differences in economic environment.
103730_15_ITEM7_P156_S3	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	The acquisitions of HiRel Systems LLC in the first fiscal quarter of 2012, MCB Industrie S.A. in the second fiscal quarter of 2013, Holy Stone Polytech in the second fiscal quarter of 2014, and a controlling interest in Capella in the third fiscal quarter of 2014 increased our amortizable intangible assets balance by $127.6 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for an estimate of our annual amortization expense through 2019.
103730_15_ITEM7_P157_S2	Additional acquisition activity will increase these amounts.
103730_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	We also recorded a $12.2 million gain on the sale of vacated property in Belgium in the second fiscal quarter of 2012 that is reported on a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	In 2013, we announced a voluntary separation / early retirement program targeting SG A expenses.
103730_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.3 million versus the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P160_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures.
103730_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	The increase in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the higher average amounts of short-term investments in 2014 versus 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $0.5 million versus the year ended December 31, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	The increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due 2042 that were issued on May 31, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	The decrease in interest income in the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily due to lower interest rates on the short-term investments in 2013 versus 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the effective tax rates were 29.5%, 29.8%, and 27.4%, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	The effective tax rates are generally less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
103730_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_15_ITEM7_P167_S1	These items were $1.2 million (tax benefit) in 2014, $4.2 million (tax benefit) in 2013, and $4.0 million (tax benefit) in 2012.
103730_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discrete items include a $1.2 million benefit recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the enactment of The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 that retroactively extended certain tax benefits from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 .
103730_15_ITEM7_P168_S1	The discrete items also include benefits upon the completion of certain tax examinations and lapses in the statute of limitations, offset by additional tax expenses for expected repatriation of cash and profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States, primarily to repay amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility to provide future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P168_S2	The latter two items netted to an immaterial amount.
103730_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the discrete items include a $2.9 million benefit recorded in the third fiscal quarter due to a new tax law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases our deferred tax assets and a $1.3 million benefit recorded in the first fiscal quarter due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Israel due to a merger of several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel in the fourth fiscal quarter, which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone.
103730_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_15_ITEM7_P171_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P171_S2	Part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_15_ITEM7_P171_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate.
103730_15_ITEM7_P171_S4	Changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_15_ITEM7_P173_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy, to reduce debt levels, and to pay dividends and repurchase stock.
103730_15_ITEM7_P173_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 13 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 20 years.
103730_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as "free cash," a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_15_ITEM7_P174_S1	Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 18 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 13 years.
103730_15_ITEM7_P174_S2	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash in line with our history during the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	Beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we have reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company's capital structure.
103730_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	We have completed three issuances of low-coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance.
103730_15_ITEM7_P176_S2	We utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase 44.3 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 24% of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives.
103730_15_ITEM7_P176_S3	In the third fiscal quarter of 2013, a holder of our exchangeable unsecured notes exercised its option to exchange $56.4 million principal amount of the notes for 3.7 million shares of our common stock.
103730_15_ITEM7_P176_S4	The exchange increased the number of our common shares outstanding, but had no effect on the calculation of the weighted average shares outstanding used for computing diluted earnings per share because our earnings per share computation assumes that the exchangeable unsecured notes would be converted, while also reducing our outstanding debt and improving our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity.
103730_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	We also entered into a new, larger, revolving credit facility in 2010, which was amended and restated on August 8, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P177_S1	The amended and restated credit facility extends the term of our available credit, secures lower interest rates than we were previously paying for the next five years, and provides us with additional financial flexibility to pursue our growth plan.
103730_15_ITEM7_P177_S2	The total revolving commitment of our credit facility increased to $640 million and we have the ability to request up to an additional $50 million of incremental commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P177_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, $200 million and $114 million, respectively, were outstanding under our credit facility.
103730_15_ITEM7_P177_S4	The credit facility provides a revolving commitment through August 8, 2018.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S2	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S3	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S4	We are also required to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount based on our leverage ratio.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S5	Based on our current leverage ratio, the facility fee is 0.35% per annum.
103730_15_ITEM7_P178_S6	Such facility fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	The amendment and restatement of the credit facility also removed certain restrictions related to the incurrence and repayment of certain intercompany indebtedness, mergers, liquidations, and transfers of ownership of wholly owned subsidiaries that were present in the original credit agreement.
103730_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	These changes will enable us to streamline our complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_15_ITEM7_P180_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	The credit facility also limits or restricts us, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, and making asset sales, and making other restricted payments, and requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_15_ITEM7_P182_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article VI of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed August 8, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P183_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 13.22 to 1 and 1.89 to 1, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P183_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_15_ITEM7_P184_S1	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our permitted capacity to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock or pay cash dividends under the credit facility increases each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	At December 31, 2014, our credit facility allowed us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends up to $192.7 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P185_S2	On February 3, 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM7_P185_S3	Cash dividends of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid on March 27, 2014, June 26, 2014, September 18, 2014, and December 16, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2014, June 12, 2014, August 28, 2014, and November 26, 2014, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM7_P185_S4	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividend payments remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	The balance of our revolving credit facility was $114 million at December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P186_S1	We borrowed $160 million and repaid $74 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P186_S2	Included in the borrowings is $53 million borrowed to partially fund the Capella acquisition while achieving future flexibility given the legal entity and financial structure utilized for the acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM7_P186_S3	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Capella on December 31, 2014, we expect to repatriate cash from current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_15_ITEM7_P186_S4	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $152 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $206 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the September 27, 2014 evaluation of the conversion criteria, due to the sale price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable period in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S1	The debentures remained convertible until December 31, 2014, at which time the conversion criteria was reevaluated.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S2	The debentures due 2042 did not meet the conversion criteria as of December 31, 2014 and are not currently convertible.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S3	The conversion criteria of the debentures will continue to be evaluated and the debentures may become convertible again in the future.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S4	At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of our common stock.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S5	We intend to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under our credit facility.
103730_15_ITEM7_P187_S6	Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible debentures due 2042 remained classified as a non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheets during the period the debentures were convertible.
103730_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	Management expects to periodically pay down the balance of our revolving credit facility with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_15_ITEM7_P188_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, regular dividend payments, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_15_ITEM7_P188_S2	Additional acquisition activity, share repurchases, or conversion of our convertible debentures may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_15_ITEM7_P188_S3	No principal payments on our outstanding debt are due before the maturity of our revolving credit facility in August 2018.
103730_15_ITEM7_P189_S0	Substantially all of our December 31, 2014 cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P189_S1	At the present time, we expect that cash and profits generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries prior to 2014, and cash generated in 2014 which is not funding the dividend program or the Capella acquisition, will continue to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_15_ITEM7_P189_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_15_ITEM7_P190_S0	We expect to fund the quarterly dividend program initiated in February 2014, by, at least in part, repatriating current year income of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and providing appropriate U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable on that current period non-U.S. income.
103730_15_ITEM7_P191_S0	Additionally, our substantially undrawn credit facility provides us with significant liquidity in the United States.
103730_15_ITEM7_P192_S0	We invest a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM7_P192_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_15_ITEM7_P193_S0	The interest rates on our short-term investments average 0.6% and are approximately 30 basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_15_ITEM7_P193_S1	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_15_ITEM7_P194_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively (in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P195_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_15_ITEM7_P196_S0	Measurements such as "free cash" and "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM7_P196_S1	Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_15_ITEM7_P196_S2	However, management believes that "free cash" is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends, and that an analysis of "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_15_ITEM7_P196_S3	These measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_15_ITEM7_P197_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2014 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.2 to 1, as compared to 4.4 to 1 as of December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P197_S1	The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash used to acquire Capella in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P197_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity was 0.25 to 1 at December 31, 2014 as compared to a ratio of 0.19 to 1 at December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P197_S3	The increase in the ratio is primarily due to the increase in the outstanding credit facility balance in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P198_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $297.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $292.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P199_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $157.0 million, as compared to $153.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P199_S1	We expect capital spending of approximately $170 million in 2015.
103730_15_ITEM7_P200_S0	Cash paid for the purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $198.0 million, as compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7_P200_S1	The Capella acquisition accounts for $177.4 million of the reported cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P200_S2	The $47.4 million of short-term investments acquired in the Capella acquisition are not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_15_ITEM7_P200_S3	The $21.1 million paid to acquire the noncontrolling interests in Capella on December 31, 2014 is reported as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_15_ITEM7_P201_S0	Cash paid for dividends to our common and Class B common stockholders totalled $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P201_S1	We expect dividend payments in 2015 to total approximately $35.4 million.
103730_15_ITEM7_P201_S2	However, any future dividend declaration and payment remains subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM7_P202_S0	As of December 31, 2014 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM7_P203_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_15_ITEM7_P203_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_15_ITEM7_P204_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement, one of which bears a maturity date of 2102, and include facility fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on August 8, 2018.
103730_15_ITEM7_P204_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042.
103730_15_ITEM7_P205_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_15_ITEM7_P205_S1	Among other things, approximately $614 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.
103730_15_ITEM7_P205_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_15_ITEM7_P205_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our variable-rate exchangeable notes due 2102 and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2014, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_15_ITEM7_P206_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014 includes liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_15_ITEM7_P206_S1	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM7_P206_S2	Accordingly, we have classified the amount recorded as a current liability as payable within one year, and the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_15_ITEM7_P207_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_15_ITEM7_P207_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_15_ITEM7_P207_S2	See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_15_ITEM7_P207_S3	These obligations were not material to us as of December 31, 2014, and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above.
103730_15_ITEM7_P208_S0	We maintain long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_15_ITEM7_P208_S1	We typically have minimum purchase commitments of $30 million to $40 million per year pursuant to our long-term foundry agreements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P208_S2	We continue to work with Tower Semiconductor and anticipate having minimum purchase requirements in the future.
103730_15_ITEM7_P208_S3	At December 31, 2014, the extent of those commitments is under discussion with Tower Semiconductor, following the transfer of certain manufacturing processes among Tower Semiconductor's facilities.
103730_15_ITEM7_P209_S0	Other long-term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7_P209_S1	We include the current portion of the long-term liabilities in the table above.
103730_15_ITEM7_P209_S2	Other long-term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_15_ITEM7_P210_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM7_P211_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_15_ITEM7_P212_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_15_ITEM7_P212_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_15_ITEM7_P213_S0	See also "Commodity Price Risk" included in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional related information.
103730_15_ITEM7_P214_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .
103730_15_ITEM7_P215_S0	The ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
103730_15_ITEM7_P215_S1	The ASU removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; provides more useful information to users of financial statements through expanded disclosure requirements; and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.
103730_15_ITEM7_P215_S2	The ASU is effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2017.
103730_15_ITEM7_P215_S3	We are currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on our revenue contracts.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The exchangeable notes, of which $38.6 million are outstanding, bear interest at LIBOR (reset quarterly).
103730_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2014, we had $200 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2014, we have $592.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $514.8 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2014, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $3.1 million.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Also see "Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We occasionally use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of these exposures.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2014, we entered into forward contracts with a highly-rated financial institution to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with an intercompany loan denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The notional amount of the forward contract was $48 million as of December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The intercompany loan was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for Capella.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P9_S3	The forward contracts settle monthly and are expected to be renewed at our discretion on a monthly basis until the intercompany loan is repaid.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P9_S4	The forward contract was renewed on the last day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We have not designated the forward contract as a hedge for accounting purposes, and as such the change in the fair value of contract is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We do not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S6	Where possible, we maintain local currency denominated cash balances in these countries approximately equal to the local currency liabilities to naturally hedge our exposures.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S7	We also have a slightly higher percentage of euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S8	Therefore, when the euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is slightly increased.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P11_S9	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Capella holds a significant amount of its financial assets denominated in a currency other than its functional currency and will continue to do so until the assets mature or are liquidated.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of these financial assets into the functional currency of Capella are included in the results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses of our consolidated foreign exchange risk as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P13_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $2.7 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P13_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange gains of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P15_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P17_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P17_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P18_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P18_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P19_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P19_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P19_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P20_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P20_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_15_ITEM7A_P21_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $6.4 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.

103730_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s management.
103730_15_ITEM15_P69_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P71_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
103730_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_15_ITEM15_P76_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 and our report dated February 19, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P82_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P83_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_15_ITEM15_P83_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_15_ITEM15_P83_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2014 through the date these financial statements were issued through the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
103730_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P85_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, "stock, ship and debit" credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P87_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_15_ITEM15_P87_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P87_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $4,525, $6,362, and $7,131 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $65,299, $62,090, and $57,164, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P93_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_15_ITEM15_P93_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of "more likely than not" to be realilzed.
103730_15_ITEM15_P93_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P93_S4	If the Company's assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_15_ITEM15_P93_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	Substantially all earnings generated by non-U.S. subsidiaries prior to 2014, and cash generated in 2014 which is not funding the dividend program or the Capella acquisition, are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings.
103730_15_ITEM15_P94_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company expects to fund the quarterly dividend program initiated in February 2014, by, at least in part, repatriating current year income of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and providing appropriate U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable on that current period non-U.S. income.
103730_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_15_ITEM15_P97_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_15_ITEM15_P97_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P97_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_15_ITEM15_P98_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_15_ITEM15_P98_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	The amount included in current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect only amounts expected to be settled in cash within one year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P100_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P101_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_15_ITEM15_P102_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $(424), $62, and $(24) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_15_ITEM15_P104_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_15_ITEM15_P104_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.

103730_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and administrative expenses).
103730_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	The required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are completed as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P107_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_15_ITEM15_P107_S3	The Company's business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	Certain of the Company's tradenames have been assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

103730_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P110_S1	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_15_ITEM15_P110_S2	If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not required.
103730_15_ITEM15_P110_S3	If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is required.
103730_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_15_ITEM15_P111_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_15_ITEM15_P112_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets before performing a quantitative impairment test.
103730_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	There was no impairment identified through the annual impairment tests completed in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
103730_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_15_ITEM15_P117_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P117_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for anticipated disposal costs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	Short-term investments and other assets reported on the consolidated balance sheets include time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year and investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	These assets include short-term investments acquired in the Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. ("Capella") acquisition (see Note 2), assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11), and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_15_ITEM15_P119_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until sold.
103730_15_ITEM15_P119_S4	At the time of sale, the assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_15_ITEM15_P120_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_15_ITEM15_P122_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_15_ITEM15_P122_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_15_ITEM15_P122_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Company uses financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to mitigate a portion, but not all, of the risk associated with its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_15_ITEM15_P124_S1	The purpose of the Company's foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, held-to-maturity short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P125_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM15_P126_S2	The Company's operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_15_ITEM15_P127_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P127_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs") that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2014 and 2013 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	Restructuring and severance costs reflect charges resulting from cost reduction programs implemented by the Company.
103730_15_ITEM15_P135_S1	Restructuring and severance costs include exit costs, severance benefits pursuant to an on-going arrangement, voluntary termination compensation under a defined program, and any related pension curtailment and settlement charges.
103730_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Company recognizes expense for one-time benefits only after management has committed to a plan, the plan is sufficiently detailed to provide the number, classification, and location of employees to be terminated as well as the expected completion date, the plan has been sufficiently communicated to employees such that they are able to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if terminated, and it is unlikely that the plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.
103730_15_ITEM15_P136_S1	If an employee is not required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense once the aforementioned criteria have been met.
103730_15_ITEM15_P136_S2	If an employee is required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense over the period that the employee is required to render future service.
103730_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Company recognizes expense for on-going benefit arrangements when the liability is reasonably estimable and considered probable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company recognizes expense for voluntary separation / early retirement when the employee delivers an irrevocable voluntary termination notice pursuant to a defined company program.
103730_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	The Company recognizes other exit costs as incurred.
103730_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers' liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_15_ITEM15_P141_S1	At December 31, 2014, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors' and officers' insurance.
103730_15_ITEM15_P141_S2	The captive insurance entity had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_15_ITEM15_P142_S1	Restricted cash of $7,309 and $7,927 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_15_ITEM15_P143_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_15_ITEM15_P143_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	On June 11, 2014, Vishay acquired Holy Stone Polytech Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone Polytech"), a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20,576, net of cash acquired.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	The acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's position in tantalum capacitors, especially in Asia.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations of Holy Stone Polytech have been included in the Capacitors segment since June 11, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S3	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S4	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $3,736 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S5	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $6,328 related to this acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S6	The goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P147_S7	The Company will test the goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	On July 11, 2014, Vishay entered into an agreement to acquire Capella for approximately $205,000.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	Capella is a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic products.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	As a first step in the acquisition, Vishay launched a tender offer for Capella's outstanding shares.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	A total of 38,703,705 shares of Capella, or 88.95% of outstanding shares, were tendered and accepted by Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S3	The offer period expired on September 1, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, Vishay paid NT$139 for each share tendered.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S5	The aggregate purchase price was $180,167.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S6	Capella had cash and short-term investments on hand of $50,195 at the date of acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S7	Vishay funded the acquisition with cash on hand and $53,000 of borrowings under its credit facility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S8	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest on December 31, 2014, the Company expects to repatriate cash from the current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_15_ITEM15_P149_S9	The acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's position in optoelectronic sensors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	Upon the close of the tender offer, Vishay controlled Capella and began consolidating it in its financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations and net assets of Capella have been included in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P150_S2	The interest represented by the shares not tendered are presented as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P150_S3	The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the observable quoted share price as of the acquisition date.
103730_15_ITEM15_P150_S4	Capella's results were not material to the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	Vishay acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella on December 31, 2014 pursuant to the merger agreement.
103730_15_ITEM15_P151_S1	In connection with the closing of the merger, all remaining holders of Capella common stock other than Vishay and its subsidiaries received the same consideration for their shares as the holders who tendered their shares in the tender offer, or $21,067 in the aggregate.
103730_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	The weighted average useful lives for patents and acquired technology, customer relationships, and tradenames are 10, 7, and 7 years, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P153_S1	The Company will test the goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM15_P153_S2	The goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	In evaluating the acquisition of Capella, the Company focused primarily on the ability to synergize Capella's optoelectronics design capabilities with Vishay's existing optoelectronics product lines and customers.
103730_15_ITEM15_P154_S1	As a result, the fair value of the acquired assets, including identified intangible assets, corresponds to a relatively smaller portion of the acquisition price, with the Company recording a substantial amount of goodwill associated with the acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	The Company recognized $843 of acquisition costs classified as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses in its consolidated statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	The unaudited pro forma results would have been as follows, assuming the 2014 acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2013:
103730_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	The pro forma information presented for the year ended December 31, 2014 was adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs incurred in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P157_S1	The pro forma information also includes adjustments for interest expense that would have been incurred to finance the acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation of acquired property and equipment, and tax related effects.
103730_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been attained had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	On June 13, 2013, Vishay acquired MCB Industrie S.A. ("MCB Industrie") in France, a well-established manufacturer of specialty resistors and sensors, for $23,034, net of cash acquired.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired is expected to enable Vishay to expand its presence in the European industrial market.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from June 13, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S3	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S4	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $5,433 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S5	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $7,985 related to this acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P159_S6	The goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	On January 13, 2012, Vishay acquired HiRel Systems LLC, a leading supplier of high reliability transformers, inductors, coils, and power conversion products, for $85,493, net of cash acquired.
103730_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired further enhanced the Company's inductors portfolio, particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical, military, aerospace and aviation, and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P161_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from January 13, 2012.
103730_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $43,950 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P162_S1	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $25,815 related to this acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P162_S2	The goodwill associated with this transaction is deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $18,651, $15,068, and $14,754, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2014 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	The Company places a strong emphasis on controlling its costs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	Historically, the Company's primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries, such as the United States and Western Europe, to lower-labor-cost countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, India, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_15_ITEM15_P169_S1	Between 2001 and 2009, the Company recorded, in the consolidated statements of operations, restructuring and severance costs and related asset write-downs in order to reduce its cost structure going forward.
103730_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses, which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then-applicable GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Company did not initiate any new restructuring projects in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, or 2010.
103730_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	On October 28, 2013, the Company announced various cost reduction programs as part of its continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_15_ITEM15_P172_S1	The cash costs of these programs, primarily severance, are expected to be approximately $32,000.
103730_15_ITEM15_P172_S2	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_15_ITEM15_P172_S3	Many of the severance costs will be recognized ratably over the required stay periods.
103730_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The following table summarizes restructuring and related expenses which were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and reported on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations:
103730_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	Over a period of approximately 2 years and in a period of discrete steps, the manufacture of wafers for a substantial share of products will be transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_15_ITEM15_P174_S1	As a consequence, certain other manufacturing currently occurring in-house will be transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	The total severance costs associated with these initiatives are expected to be approximately $16,000.
103730_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	Employees generally must remain with the Company during the production transfer period.
103730_15_ITEM15_P176_S1	Accordingly, the Company will accrue these severance costs ratably over the respective employees' remaining service periods.
103730_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P178_S1	The current portion of the liability is $786 and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated condensed balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P178_S2	The non-current portion of the liability is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement program was offered to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P179_S1	The program benefits vary by country and job classification, but generally include a cash loyalty bonus based on years of service.
103730_15_ITEM15_P179_S2	All employees eligible for the program have been identified, and have left or will leave the Company after the expiration of their respective transition periods.
103730_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	These employees generally were not aligned with any particular segment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P180_S1	The effective separation / retirement date for most employees who accepted the offer was June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a transition period.
103730_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The payment terms vary by country, but generally are paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P182_S1	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	In an effort to reduce costs and streamline production of its module products within its Diodes segment, the Company committed to two smaller cost reduction programs related to the transferring of production of certain of its products.
103730_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P186_S0	On April 3, 2012, Vishay sold a property in Belgium vacated as a result of its restructuring activities in prior years for approximately $14,200.
103730_15_ITEM15_P186_S1	At closing, Vishay recognized a gain on the sale of the property of $12,153 within its statements of operations and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $3,406 within its statement of cash flows.
103730_15_ITEM15_P186_S2	The remaining proceeds are reported as proceeds from the sale of property and equipment within the statements of cash flows as the cash is received.
103730_15_ITEM15_P186_S3	At December 31, 2014, the remaining amount receivable by the Company is $1,771.
103730_15_ITEM15_P187_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and noncontrolling interests consists of the following components:
103730_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	Significant components of income taxes are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P189_S1	Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	The Company makes significant judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets (principally net operating losses).
103730_15_ITEM15_P190_S1	The carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize these assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
103730_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax provision is as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_15_ITEM15_P192_S1	These items total $1,228 (tax benefit), $4,197 (tax benefit), and $4,036 (tax benefit) in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discrete items include a $1,228 benefit recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the enactment of The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P193_S1	The discrete items also include benefits upon the completion of certain tax examinations and lapses in the statute of limitations, offset by additional tax expenses for expected repatriation of cash and profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States, primarily to repay amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility to provide future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P193_S2	The latter two items netted to an immaterial amount.
103730_15_ITEM15_P194_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the discrete items include a $2,867 benefit recorded in the third fiscal quarter due to a new tax law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases the deferred tax assets, and a $1,330 benefit recorded in the first fiscal quarter due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P195_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Israel due to a merger of several of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel in the fourth fiscal quarter which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone.
103730_15_ITEM15_P196_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had the following significant net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes:
103730_15_ITEM15_P197_S0	Approximately $64,232 of the carryforwards in Belgium resulted from the Company's acquisition of BCcomponents in 2002.
103730_15_ITEM15_P197_S1	Valuation allowances of $21,833 and $24,788, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, have been recorded through goodwill for these acquired net operating losses.
103730_15_ITEM15_P197_S2	Prior to the adoption of updated guidance in ASC Topic 805 on January 1, 2009, if tax benefits were recognized through the utilization of these acquired net operating losses, the benefits of such loss utilization were recorded as a reduction to goodwill.
103730_15_ITEM15_P197_S3	After the adoption of the updated guidance on January 1, 2009, the benefits of such losses are recorded as a reduction of tax expense.
103730_15_ITEM15_P198_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had the following significant tax credit carryforwards available:
103730_15_ITEM15_P199_S0	At December 31, 2014, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,686,284 of foreign earnings.
103730_15_ITEM15_P199_S1	Substantially all earnings generated by non-U.S. subsidiaries prior to 2014, and cash generated in 2014 which is not funding the dividend program or the Capella acquisition (as discussed below), are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_15_ITEM15_P199_S2	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P200_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P201_S0	In 2008, the Company recorded additional tax expense for an expected repatriation of $112,500 because such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.
103730_15_ITEM15_P201_S1	During 2012 and 2014, the Company repatriated $72,100 and $4,588 of cash, respectively, which completed the repatriation program initiated in 2008.
103730_15_ITEM15_P201_S2	This repatriated cash was used to reduce the amount outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P202_S0	During 2014, the Company borrowed $53,000 on its revolving credit facility to achieve future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition (see Note 2).
103730_15_ITEM15_P202_S1	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Capella on December 31, 2014, the Company expects to repatriate cash from the current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_15_ITEM15_P202_S2	The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes all U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable related to that anticipated repatriation transaction.
103730_15_ITEM15_P203_S0	The Company expects to fund the quarterly dividend program initiated in February 2014, by, at least in part, repatriating current year income of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and providing appropriate U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable on that current period non-U.S. income.
103730_15_ITEM15_P204_S0	Net income taxes paid were $62,051, $44,757, and $46,611 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P205_S0	See Note 19 for a discussion of the tax-related uncertainties for the pre-spin-off period of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("VPG"), which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_15_ITEM15_P206_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_15_ITEM15_P207_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits of $26,583 and $45,877, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized.
103730_15_ITEM15_P208_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_15_ITEM15_P208_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $3,104 and $7,766, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P208_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company recognized $1,839, $2,218, and $2,833, respectively, in interest and penalties.
103730_15_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P209_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, certain tax examinations were completed and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_15_ITEM15_P209_S2	The tax provision for those years includes adjustments related to the resolution of these matters, as reflected in the table above.
103730_15_ITEM15_P210_S0	In 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examination of Vishay's U.S. federal tax returns through the 2011 tax year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P210_S1	The tax returns of other non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include France (2012 and 2013), Germany (2009 through 2012), India (2004 through 2012), Israel (2009 through 2012), and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (2012).
103730_15_ITEM15_P210_S2	The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P211_S0	The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that result from such examinations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P211_S1	These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current unrecognized tax benefits.
103730_15_ITEM15_P211_S2	The Company believes that in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations will conclude or the statutes of limitation on certain income tax periods open to examination will expire, or both.
103730_15_ITEM15_P211_S3	Given the uncertainties described above, the Company can only determine an estimate of potential decreases in unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $2,400 to $2,700.
103730_15_ITEM15_P212_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_15_ITEM15_P213_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility").
103730_15_ITEM15_P213_S1	On August 8, 2013, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate commitment of $640,000 of revolving loans available until August 8, 2018.
103730_15_ITEM15_P213_S2	The original credit agreement became effective December 1, 2010 and was scheduled to expire on December 1, 2015.
103730_15_ITEM15_P213_S3	The Credit Facility, as amended and restated, also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $50,000 of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S0	Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an interest margin.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on the Company's leverage ratio.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S2	Based on the Company's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S3	The interest rate on the Company's borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if the Company's leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if the Company's leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S4	Vishay is also required to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount based on the Company's leverage ratio.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S5	Based on the Company's current leverage ratio, the facility fee is 0.35% per annum.
103730_15_ITEM15_P214_S6	Such facility fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if the Company's leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if the leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_15_ITEM15_P215_S0	The August 8, 2013 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also removes certain restrictions related to the incurrence and repayment of certain intercompany indebtedness, mergers, liquidations, and transfers of ownership of wholly owned subsidiaries that were present in the original credit agreement.
103730_15_ITEM15_P215_S1	These changes will enable the Company to streamline its complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P216_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P216_S1	Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P216_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P216_S3	The Credit Facility also limits or restricts the Company and its subsidiaries, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its respective assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and making other restricted payments, and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_15_ITEM15_P217_S0	The Credit Facility permits the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock or pay cash dividends up to a permitted capacity, conditioned upon Vishay maintaining (i) a pro forma leverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.00, (ii) a pro forma interest expense coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00, and (iii) $300,000 of available liquidity, as defined in the Credit Facility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P217_S1	The permitted capacity to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock or pay cash dividends under the Credit Facility increases each quarter by an amount equal to 20% of net income.
103730_15_ITEM15_P217_S2	At December 31, 2014, the Credit Facility allows the Company to repurchase its common stock or pay cash dividends up to $192,733 (See Note 7).
103730_15_ITEM15_P217_S3	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividends remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P218_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, material misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P218_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the Company's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P219_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, there was $432,445 and $518,345, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P219_S1	Letters of credit totaling $7,555 and $7,655 were outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P220_S0	Vishay currently has three issuances of convertible senior debentures outstanding with generally congruent terms.
103730_15_ITEM15_P220_S1	The proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior debentures were used to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P221_S0	The quarterly cash dividend program of the Company results in adjustments to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for each issuance of the Company's convertible senior debentures effective as of the ex-dividend date of each cash dividend.
103730_15_ITEM15_P222_S0	The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the three series of outstanding convertible senior debentures following the adjustment made to the conversion rate of the debentures on the ex-dividend date of the December 16, 2014 dividend payment:
103730_15_ITEM15_P223_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_15_ITEM15_P224_S0	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the September 27, 2014 evaluation of the conversion criteria, due to the sale price of Vishay's common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable period in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P224_S1	The debentures due 2042 remained convertible until December 31, 2014, at which time the conversion criteria was reevaluated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P224_S2	The convertible debentures due 2042 are no longer convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2014 reevaluation of the conversion criteria.
103730_15_ITEM15_P224_S3	The conversion criteria of the convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 will continue to be evaluated and the convertible debentures may become convertible again in the future.
103730_15_ITEM15_P225_S0	The debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of Vishay's common stock or a combination thereof, at Vishay's option, at the conversion rate.
103730_15_ITEM15_P225_S1	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon future conversion of any of the convertible senior debentures, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P225_S2	The Company intends to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under its credit facility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P225_S3	Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible debentures due 2042 remained classified as a non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheets during the period such debentures were convertible.
103730_15_ITEM15_P226_S0	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "fundamental change" in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_15_ITEM15_P227_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to the respective call dates.
103730_15_ITEM15_P227_S1	On or after the call date and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay's common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_15_ITEM15_P228_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_15_ITEM15_P228_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_15_ITEM15_P229_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P230_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company's estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_15_ITEM15_P230_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances beginning ten years subsequent to issuance.
103730_15_ITEM15_P231_S0	Interest expense related to the debentures is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
103730_15_ITEM15_P232_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_15_ITEM15_P232_S1	The notes are governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_15_ITEM15_P232_S2	The notes may be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, may be called by Vishay for similar consideration.
103730_15_ITEM15_P233_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes are deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spin-off, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,042 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_15_ITEM15_P234_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement the holders may at any time put the notes to Vishay in exchange for shares of Vishay's common stock, and Vishay may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.
103730_15_ITEM15_P235_S1	Subsequent to the spin-off of VPG, the put/call rate of the Vishay notes is $15.39 per share of common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P236_S0	The payment of quarterly cash dividends does not result in an adjustment to the put/call rate of the notes (See Note 7).
103730_15_ITEM15_P237_S0	Effective August 26, 2013, a holder of the notes exercised its option to exchange $56,400 principal amount of the notes for 3,664,729 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P237_S1	Following this transaction, Vishay had outstanding exchangeable unsecured notes with a principal amount of $38,642, which are exchangeable for an aggregate of 2,511,742 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P238_S0	The notes bear interest at LIBOR.
103730_15_ITEM15_P238_S1	Interest continues to be payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each calendar year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P240_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $16,700, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_15_ITEM15_P241_S1	At December 31, 2013, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $27,400, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	Interest paid was $18,394, $17,647, and $16,578 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P243_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
103730_15_ITEM15_P244_S0	The Company's Class B common stock carries ten votes per share while the common stock carries one vote per share.
103730_15_ITEM15_P244_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P244_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P244_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P245_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P245_S1	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_15_ITEM15_P245_S2	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.
103730_15_ITEM15_P246_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Credit Facility allows the Company to repurchase its common stock or pay cash dividends up to $192,733, conditioned upon the Company maintaining specific pro forma financial ratios and a required minimum amount of available liquidity, as defined in the credit agreement.
103730_15_ITEM15_P246_S1	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P247_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	*At December 31, 2014, the convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are convertible into 20,134,043, 8,014,230, and 12,912,435 shares, respectively, of Vishay common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P248_S1	The Company has reserved adequate shares to ensure it could issue the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_15_ITEM15_P249_S0	On February 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.
103730_15_ITEM15_P249_S1	Cash dividends of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid on March 27, 2014, June 26, 2014, September 18, 2014, and December 16, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2014, June 12, 2014, August 28, 2014, and November 26, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P249_S2	The amount and timing of any future dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P250_S0	The caption "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:
103730_15_ITEM15_P251_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_15_ITEM15_P252_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P253_S0	Reclassifications of pension and other post-retirement actuarial items out of AOCI are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
103730_15_ITEM15_P253_S1	(See Note 11 for further information).
103730_15_ITEM15_P253_S2	The amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of securities held by the Company's rabbi trust used to fund a deferred compensation plan was $24, $1,966, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P253_S3	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of compensation expense within Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P254_S0	The pre-tax amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of available-for-sale securities was $54, $53, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P254_S1	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of Other Income on our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P254_S2	The tax effect of the reclassifications of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities is recorded as a component of Income Tax Expense on our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P255_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay's proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_15_ITEM15_P256_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_15_ITEM15_P257_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_15_ITEM15_P257_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_15_ITEM15_P258_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_15_ITEM15_P259_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_15_ITEM15_P260_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_15_ITEM15_P260_S1	These include pension plans which are "qualified" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code, and "non-qualified" pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_15_ITEM15_P261_S0	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P262_S0	The Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee issued new mortality tables and a new mortality improvement scale in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P262_S1	The new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale are based on a recent study of mortality experience in the United States, and reflect improved retiree longevity.
103730_15_ITEM15_P262_S2	The use of the new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale increased the Company's projected benefit obligations by approximately $24,000 and will increase future net periodic pension cost.
103730_15_ITEM15_P263_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans historically included both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_15_ITEM15_P263_S1	The Company's principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_15_ITEM15_P263_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P264_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_15_ITEM15_P264_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_15_ITEM15_P264_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P264_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_15_ITEM15_P265_S0	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_15_ITEM15_P265_S1	All of the Company's qualified U.S. pension plans have been merged into the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_15_ITEM15_P266_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, the Company executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with its U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P266_S1	These transactions included the purchase of annuity contracts for approximately 700 participants pursuant to an arrangement inherited in a past acquisition and a special limited-time voluntary lump-sum payment offer to certain former employees who were deferred vested participants of the plan not currently receiving periodic payments of their pension benefit.
103730_15_ITEM15_P266_S2	A total of 800 participants accepted the voluntary lump-sum offer.
103730_15_ITEM15_P266_S3	The plan is no longer obligated to pay any benefits to the 1,500 participants covered by these two settlement transactions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P266_S4	These former participants represented approximately 23% of the total participants prior to executing these transactions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P267_S0	These transactions were funded entirely with plan assets and resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15,588, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_15_ITEM15_P267_S1	These non-cash charges are presented on a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P268_S0	The Company continues to evaluate options to further reduce the risk associated with its pension obligations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P269_S0	The Company's principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_15_ITEM15_P269_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_15_ITEM15_P270_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_15_ITEM15_P270_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_15_ITEM15_P270_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_15_ITEM15_P270_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P270_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $21,757 and $18,678 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P271_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_15_ITEM15_P271_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_15_ITEM15_P271_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P271_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_15_ITEM15_P272_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_15_ITEM15_P272_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_15_ITEM15_P273_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_15_ITEM15_P273_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_15_ITEM15_P273_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_15_ITEM15_P273_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_15_ITEM15_P273_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P273_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $3,607 and $4,221 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P274_S0	In 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul's and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman's employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_15_ITEM15_P274_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_15_ITEM15_P274_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_15_ITEM15_P275_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_15_ITEM15_P275_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P276_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:
103730_15_ITEM15_P277_S0	The plan assets are stated at fair value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P277_S1	See Note 18 for further discussion of the valuation of the plan assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P278_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of the following:
103730_15_ITEM15_P279_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_15_ITEM15_P280_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the projected and accumulated benefit obligations:
103730_15_ITEM15_P281_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost:
103730_15_ITEM15_P282_S0	See Note 10 for the pretax, tax effect and after tax amounts included in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.
103730_15_ITEM15_P282_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2014 is $13,700.
103730_15_ITEM15_P283_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_15_ITEM15_P284_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:
103730_15_ITEM15_P285_S0	The plans' expected return on assets is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_15_ITEM15_P285_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P286_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plan was remeasured during 2014 concurrent with the two partial settlement transactions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P287_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P288_S0	The Company's U.S. defined benefit plans are invested in diversified portfolios of public-market equity and fixed income securities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P288_S1	Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and, in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_15_ITEM15_P288_S2	The target allocation is adjusted based on the funded status of the plan and the duration of the obligation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P288_S3	Based on market interest rate conditions and the current market value of the plan assets at December 31, 2014, the qualified defined benefit plan in the U.S. is fully-funded.
103730_15_ITEM15_P288_S4	Accordingly, the target asset allocation strategy for this plan is approximately 10% of the assets invested in equity securities and 90% invested in fixed income securities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P289_S0	The Company is evaluating options to further reduce the risk associated with its pension obligations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P290_S0	The Company's non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P290_S1	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P290_S2	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P290_S3	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.

103730_15_ITEM15_P293_S0	The Company's anticipated 2015 contributions for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans will approximate the expected benefit payments disclosed above.
103730_15_ITEM15_P294_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains unfunded non-pension postretirement plans, including medical benefits for certain executives and their surviving spouses, which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_15_ITEM15_P294_S1	One of these plans was amended effective January 1, 2012, which reduced the benefit obligations of the Company.
103730_15_ITEM15_P294_S2	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.

103730_15_ITEM15_P299_S0	The estimated actuarial items for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2014 are not material and approximate the amounts amortized in 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P300_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_15_ITEM15_P301_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:
103730_15_ITEM15_P302_S0	The impact of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation is not material.
103730_15_ITEM15_P303_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_15_ITEM15_P304_S0	As the plans are unfunded, the Company's anticipated contributions for 2015 are equal to its estimated benefits payments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P305_S0	The Company participates in various other defined contribution and government-mandated retirement plans based on local law or custom.
103730_15_ITEM15_P305_S1	The Company periodically makes required contributions for certain of these plans, whereas other plans are unfunded retirement bonus plans which will be paid at the employee's retirement date.

103730_15_ITEM15_P307_S2	The Company maintains a liability within other noncurrent liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets related to these deferrals.
103730_15_ITEM15_P307_S3	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund payments under this plan.
103730_15_ITEM15_P307_S4	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_15_ITEM15_P307_S5	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P307_S6	Assets held in trust related to the deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $14,906 and $14,093, respectively.

103730_15_ITEM15_P312_S2	$1,778 of these reversed costs had been originally reported as a separate line item upon cessation of employment of certain former executives in 2011, and accordingly, this adjustment is also reported as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P313_S0	A portion of the stock-based compensation expense related to certain current executives that was reversed in the second fiscal quarter of 2013 was recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 due to certain amendments to the performance-based RSUs granted to certain current executives in 2011 approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Director's in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P313_S1	Pursuant to their original terms, the performance-based RSUs would have vested on January 1, 2014 only if all of the associated performance criteria were met for the three-year period ending December 31, 2013.
103730_15_ITEM15_P313_S2	Pursuant to the amended terms, 75% of the performance-based RSUs of each of the certain current executives vested effective December 5, 2013 in light of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Director's assessment that the performance criteria would be achieved in substantial part by December 31, 2013.

103730_15_ITEM15_P323_S1	In the event of voluntary termination by the executive (without "good reason") or termination for cause, the executive's outstanding RSUs and performance-based RSUs will be forfeited.
103730_15_ITEM15_P324_S0	The 2007 Program authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to the extent provided for in the Company's employment agreements with certain executives.
103730_15_ITEM15_P324_S1	Each phantom stock unit entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock at the individual's termination of employment or any other future date specified in the applicable employment agreement.

103730_15_ITEM15_P339_S1	Management assesses the input from these consultants along with other information known to the Company in its effort to continually monitor these potential liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P339_S2	Such assessments include the Company's share of remediation costs, information known to the Company concerning the size of the hazardous waste sites, their years of operation, and the number of past users and their financial viability.

103730_15_ITEM15_P346_S2	Annual warranty expenses are generally not significant.
103730_15_ITEM15_P347_S0	The Company periodically receives claims which arise from consequential damages which result from a customer's installation of an alleged defective Vishay component into the customer's product.
103730_15_ITEM15_P347_S1	Although not covered by its stated warranty, Vishay may occasionally reimburse the customer for these consequential damages in limited circumstances.
103730_15_ITEM15_P348_S0	The Company has employment agreements with certain of its senior executives.
103730_15_ITEM15_P348_S1	These employment agreements provide incremental compensation in the event of termination.

103730_15_ITEM15_P349_S0	On May 13, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman (the "2009 Agreement").
103730_15_ITEM15_P349_S1	This agreement amended and restated the employment agreement between the Company and Dr. Zandman that was previously amended and restated as of January 1, 2004 (the "2004 Agreement").
103730_15_ITEM15_P350_S0	The purpose of the 2009 Agreement was to eliminate the right of Dr. Zandman to receive a royalty during the ten years following his termination of employment equal to 5% of gross sales, less returns and allowances, of Vishay products incorporating inventions and any other form of technology created, discovered or developed by him or under his direction.
103730_15_ITEM15_P350_S1	The royalty was payable in the event Dr. Zandman was terminated without "cause" or resigned for "good reason," as defined in the 2004 Agreement.
103730_15_ITEM15_P350_S2	This provision was carried over from Dr. Zandman's original employment agreement of March 1985, and could not be modified or eliminated without Dr. Zandman's consent.
103730_15_ITEM15_P350_S3	It was a reflection, among other things, of Dr. Zandman's key role in the founding of the Company and in creating, developing and commercializing the Company's technologies and the absence of any compensation to Dr. Zandman for the core intellectual property that he contributed to the Company over the years from its inception.
103730_15_ITEM15_P351_S0	The Company engaged a consultant in 2007 to assist its evaluation of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment to be terminated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P351_S1	Based in part upon the work of this consultant and management's own updated computations, management estimated that the present value of the royalties to which Dr. Zandman would be entitled were his employment terminated at December 31, 2008 would have been between approximately $370,000 and $445,000, with a possible tax gross-up if the royalties were payable in connection with a change of control and deemed subject to an excise tax.
103730_15_ITEM15_P352_S0	Pursuant to the 2009 Agreement, Dr. Zandman's right to the royalty payments was terminated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P352_S1	Dr. Zandman received a payment of $10,000 as of the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, and he or his estate was entitled to receive annual payments of $10,000 each through 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P352_S2	Dr. Zandman's passing in June 2011 had no effect on the timing of these payments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P352_S3	The Company recognized the compensation expense equal to the present value of these payments in 2009.
103730_15_ITEM15_P352_S4	The Company recognized no tax benefit associated with the executive employment agreement charge.
103730_15_ITEM15_P352_S5	The last annual payment was made in 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P353_S0	The Company recognized executive compensation charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 for other elements of compensation that accelerated upon the passing of Dr. Zandman and for elements of compensation payable to the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, in connection with his resignation.
103730_15_ITEM15_P354_S0	The Company recognized a credit of $1,778 reported as the executive compensation credit in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 for the reversal of stock-based compensation expense previously recorded for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest to Dr. Zandman's estate and the Company's former Chief Financial Officer on January 1, 2014 at the time it was determined that achievement of the performance-based vesting criteria was no longer probable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P355_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of net revenues, a material portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, automotive, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P355_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_15_ITEM15_P355_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company's products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
103730_15_ITEM15_P356_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P356_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P356_S2	As of December 31, 2014, one customer comprised 14.7% of the Company's accounts receivable balance.

103730_15_ITEM15_P357_S0	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_15_ITEM15_P357_S1	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P358_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P358_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_15_ITEM15_P358_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_15_ITEM15_P359_S0	Many of the Company's products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_15_ITEM15_P359_S1	The Company's consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_15_ITEM15_P359_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company's customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_15_ITEM15_P359_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net earnings.
103730_15_ITEM15_P360_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum.
103730_15_ITEM15_P361_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P361_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_15_ITEM15_P362_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_15_ITEM15_P362_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company's ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_15_ITEM15_P362_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company's ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company's products.
103730_15_ITEM15_P363_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_15_ITEM15_P363_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company's policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_15_ITEM15_P363_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P364_S0	Recently enacted rules in the U.S. on conflict minerals, which include tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold, all of which are used in the Company's products, could result in increased prices and decreased supply of conflict minerals, which could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P365_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 76% of revenues earned during 2014 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_15_ITEM15_P365_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, $1,100,025 of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_15_ITEM15_P366_S0	Some of the Company's products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_15_ITEM15_P366_S1	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_15_ITEM15_P366_S2	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_15_ITEM15_P367_S0	As of December 31, 2014 the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_15_ITEM15_P368_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 44 years.
103730_15_ITEM15_P368_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_15_ITEM15_P369_S0	Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_15_ITEM15_P370_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ("segment operating income").
103730_15_ITEM15_P370_S1	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_15_ITEM15_P370_S2	The Company's calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains or losses on sales of property, and other items.
103730_15_ITEM15_P370_S3	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_15_ITEM15_P370_S4	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_15_ITEM15_P371_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_15_ITEM15_P372_S0	The Company has also disclosed certain additional items not used to evaluate segment performance.
103730_15_ITEM15_P372_S1	In some cases, the items are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are required to be disclosed by GAAP.
103730_15_ITEM15_P372_S2	Additionally, the additional segment disclosures may provide insight to the Company's future profitability by reportable segment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P373_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_15_ITEM15_P374_S0	See Note 4 for restructuring and severance costs segment information.
103730_15_ITEM15_P375_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_15_ITEM15_P376_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_15_ITEM15_P377_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_15_ITEM15_P377_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P378_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM15_P379_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_15_ITEM15_P380_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_15_ITEM15_P381_S0	The Company's convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_15_ITEM15_P381_S1	The convertible debentures due 2042 were convertible subsequent to the September 27, 2014 evaluation of the conversion criteria until subsequent to the December 31, 2014 evaluation of the conversion criteria.
103730_15_ITEM15_P381_S2	In periods that the debentures are not convertible, the certain conditions which could trigger conversion of the remaining debentures have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_15_ITEM15_P382_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_15_ITEM15_P382_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the "treasury stock method" (similar to options and warrants) rather than the "if converted method" otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_15_ITEM15_P382_S2	Under the "treasury stock method," Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the debentures based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_15_ITEM15_P382_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.66, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $18.72, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $11.62, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2042.
103730_15_ITEM15_P383_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_15_ITEM15_P384_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P384_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_15_ITEM15_P384_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_15_ITEM15_P385_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_15_ITEM15_P386_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_15_ITEM15_P386_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_15_ITEM15_P387_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions.
103730_15_ITEM15_P388_S0	An asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_15_ITEM15_P389_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013:
103730_15_ITEM15_P390_S0	The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as "rabbi" trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans.
103730_15_ITEM15_P390_S1	Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale, and company-owned life insurance assets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P390_S2	The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P390_S3	The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company's insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts.
103730_15_ITEM15_P390_S4	The fair value measurement of the marketable securities held in the rabbi trust is considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P391_S0	The Company maintains defined benefit retirement plans in certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_15_ITEM15_P391_S1	The assets of the plans are measured at fair value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P392_S0	Equity securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of various mutual funds and exchange traded funds that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P392_S1	The fair value measurement of the mutual funds and exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P393_S0	Fixed income securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of exchange traded funds, investments in a group annuity contract, and a short-term investment fund.

103730_15_ITEM15_P393_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P394_S0	The group annuity contract consists of a general asset account and a pooled separate account.
103730_15_ITEM15_P394_S1	Units of the general asset account are valued based on a discounted cash flow model using the current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations and similar credit risk.
103730_15_ITEM15_P394_S2	The pooled separate accounts are valued based on the value of the underlying bond funds, which are valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year, with adjustments made to reflect the nature of how the investment is held.
103730_15_ITEM15_P395_S0	The fair value measurement of the group annuity contract is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P396_S0	The short-term investment fund strictly invests in short-term investments, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, U.S. government obligations, corporate notes, and funding agreements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P396_S1	The maturity date of all investments held by the short-term investment fund is within one year from the financial statement date.
103730_15_ITEM15_P396_S2	There are no redemption restrictions on the plan's investment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P397_S0	The fair value of the short-term investment fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investment.
103730_15_ITEM15_P397_S1	The fair value measurement of the short-term investment fund is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P398_S0	Real estate investments held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consisted of real estate investment trust securities that were valued at quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P398_S1	There were no real estate investment trust securities held by the U.S. defined benefit retirement plans at December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P399_S0	The fair value measurement of the real estate investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P400_S0	Equity securities held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of equity securities that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P400_S1	The fair value measurement of the equity securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P401_S0	Fixed income securities held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of government bonds in the Philippines and India and corporate notes that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.

103730_15_ITEM15_P402_S0	Cash held by the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consists of demand deposits on account in various financial institutions to fund current benefit payments.
103730_15_ITEM15_P402_S1	The carrying amount of the cash approximates its fair value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P403_S0	The Company holds available for sale investments in debt securities that are intended to fund a portion of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_15_ITEM15_P403_S1	The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P403_S2	The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P404_S0	The convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, issued by the Company on November 9, 2010, May 13, 2011, and May 31, 2012, respectively, contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period.
103730_15_ITEM15_P404_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_15_ITEM15_P405_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_15_ITEM15_P405_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company's current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures' credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_15_ITEM15_P405_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management's judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P406_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P407_S0	Beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2014, the Company entered into forward contracts with a highly-rated financial institution to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with an intercompany loan denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.
103730_15_ITEM15_P407_S1	The notional amount of the forward contracts was $48,000 as of December 31, 2014.
103730_15_ITEM15_P407_S2	The intercompany loan was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for Capella.
103730_15_ITEM15_P407_S3	The forward contracts settle monthly and are expected to be renewed at the Company's discretion on a monthly basis until the intercompany loan is repaid.
103730_15_ITEM15_P407_S4	The forward contract was renewed on the last day of the year.
103730_15_ITEM15_P408_S0	We have not designated the forward contract as a hedge for accounting purposes, and as such the change in the fair value of the contract is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_15_ITEM15_P408_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of the forward contract based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using current market information and is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierachy.
103730_15_ITEM15_P408_S2	Due to the timing of the renewal of the forward contract, the value of the forward contract was immaterial as of December 31, 2104.
103730_15_ITEM15_P409_S0	The Company does not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_15_ITEM15_P410_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability, at December 31, 2014 and 2013 is approximately $853,500 and $750,700, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability, of $453,817 and $363,874, respectively.
103730_15_ITEM15_P410_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P411_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
103730_15_ITEM15_P411_S1	The short-term investments acquired in the Capella acquisition are accounted for as available for sale instruments, at fair value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P411_S2	The Company's remaining short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
103730_15_ITEM15_P411_S3	The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity.
103730_15_ITEM15_P412_S0	At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary.
103730_15_ITEM15_P412_S1	No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented.
103730_15_ITEM15_P412_S2	There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification.
103730_15_ITEM15_P412_S3	All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities' maturity dates.
103730_15_ITEM15_P413_S0	Interest on the securities is recognized as interest income when earned.
103730_15_ITEM15_P414_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were comprised of demand deposits, time deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased, and money market funds.
103730_15_ITEM15_P414_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs.
103730_15_ITEM15_P414_S2	Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_15_ITEM15_P415_S0	The Company's financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.
103730_15_ITEM15_P415_S1	The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values.
103730_15_ITEM15_P416_S0	On July 6, 2010, Vishay completed the spin-off of its measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. through a tax-free stock dividend to Vishay's stockholders.
103730_15_ITEM15_P416_S1	Vishay's common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and Vishay's Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_15_ITEM15_P417_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_15_ITEM15_P418_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG and Vishay operate separately, each as independent public companies.
103730_15_ITEM15_P418_S1	Vishay Intertechnology has no ownership interest in VPG.
103730_15_ITEM15_P418_S2	However, Ruta Zandman controls a large portion of the voting power of both Vishay and VPG.
103730_15_ITEM15_P418_S3	Marc Zandman, Vishay's Executive Chairman of the Board and an executive officer of Vishay, serves as the Chairman of VPG.
103730_15_ITEM15_P418_S4	Ziv Shoshani, CEO of VPG, serves as a director of Vishay.
103730_15_ITEM15_P418_S5	Additionally, Timothy V. Talbert, a member of Vishay's Board of Directors is also a member of the Board of Directors of VPG.
103730_15_ITEM15_P419_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_15_ITEM15_P419_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_15_ITEM15_P419_S2	None of the agreements have had nor are expected to have a material impact on Vishay's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_15_ITEM15_P420_S0	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term "Vishay" in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay's product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_15_ITEM15_P420_S1	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_15_ITEM15_P421_S0	Until the spin-off, VPG was included in Vishay's consolidated federal income tax returns and with Vishay and/or certain of Vishay's subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.

103730_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	In the 1950's, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with a loan from the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	These products were included with the measurements and foil resistor businesses that we spun off into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("Vishay Precision Group" or "VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders on July 6, 2010.
103730_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	In the early 1990's, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay's global market position in passive components.
103730_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011; HiRel Systems in 2012; MCB Industrie in 2013; and Holy Stone Polytech in 2014.
103730_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	In the late 1990's, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Vishay's next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay's acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_16_ITEM1_P7_S4	In 2014, Vishay increased its position in optoelectronic sensors through its acquisition of Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic components.

103730_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	We have often targeted high margin niche business acquisitions, such as Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, and MCB Industrie.
103730_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	In 2014, we made strategic acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech and Capella, and plan to use the technology and engineering capabilities acquired to further grow our business.
103730_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	The 2014 acquisitions accounted for 2.2% of 2015 revenues.
103730_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 19 years and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 14 years.
103730_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures (see "Cost Management" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") to contribute to our "free cash" generation going forward.
103730_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2015, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $657.8 million.
103730_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $640 million through December 10, 2020, of which $442.7 million was available as of December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong "free cash" flow generation provide financial strength and flexibility and reduce our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by fluctuating consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, modify existing products, respond to technological change, and customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have licenses to use, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
103730_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	We plan to continue to use our research and development ("R D"), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	As part of our plan to foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by approximately 20% since 2009.
103730_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	In addition, we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase opportunities to design-in our products in local markets.

103730_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product's classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed "dies" or "chips") on each wafer.
103730_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed "packages") that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel.
103730_16_ITEM1_P62_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Dominican Republic, Japan, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_16_ITEM1_P62_S5	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	All of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification.
103730_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Certain materials, in addition to tantalum and including tin, tungsten, and gold are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers, the source for which may be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country.
103730_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	We are working toward the elimination of materials that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries from our supply chain.
103730_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2015 is shown below:
103730_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers' specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer's business requirements.
103730_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ("FAEs") to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers' engineering needs.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay "design-in" the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_16_ITEM1_P80_S6	Our 2014 acquisition of Capella greatly increased our in-house design capabilities, particularly for optoelectronic components.
103730_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People's Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	We also employ research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:
103730_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	MOSFETs: Fairchild Semiconductor, Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	Diodes: Diodes, Inc., Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics.
103730_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Optoelectronic Components: Avago, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors, Rohm, Sharp, Toshiba.
103730_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Resistors and Inductors: KOA, Murata, Panasonic, Rohm, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	Capacitors: AVX, KEMET, Murata, Nichicon, Panasonic, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	There are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete.
103730_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	Our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability, technological innovation, business reputation, and price competitiveness.
103730_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_16_ITEM1_P93_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity's or individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 22,400 full time employees, of whom approximately 89% were located outside the United States.
103730_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_16_ITEM1_P100_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_16_ITEM1_P105_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_16_ITEM1_P105_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_16_ITEM1_P105_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_16_ITEM1_P105_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_16_ITEM1_P106_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM1_P106_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_16_ITEM1_P106_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_16_ITEM1_P106_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_16_ITEM1_P107_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_16_ITEM1_P107_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_16_ITEM1_P107_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_16_ITEM1_P107_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_16_ITEM1_P108_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and future periods of decline and recovery are not predictable.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Market conditions, such as a decline in product demand on a global basis, could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and will continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to achieve synergies, eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions, and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In 2013 and 2015, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The programs primarily focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses company-wide, and improving the performance of certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We incur accelerated depreciation expenses related to assets that will no longer be used after the associated restructuring programs are implemented.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The expenses associated with the programs have been and will continue to be recorded as they become recognizable under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
103730_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of 2017.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are subject to various U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations that may affect our ability to complete certain acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, or we cannot effectively mitigate the assumed, contingent, and unknown liabilities acquired, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Certain acquisitions will increase the risks inherent in our business.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our acquisition of Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. is unique compared to our past acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Most of our previous acquisitions were established businesses with substantial tangible assets.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a fabless design business, most of the assets acquired in the Capella transaction were intangible.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Capella business has not performed as expected.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, it was determined in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 that the depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets of Capella were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If the acquired business continues to not perform as expected, we may be required to record further impairment charges related to those intangible assets, with limited ability to monetize any of those assets.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are significant risks specific to the acquired business that could result in it continuing to not perform as expected.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a fabless design business, Capella is substantially dependent on independent third-party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture its products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If Capella cannot obtain sufficient capacity commitments, if Capella's foundries and subcontractors suffer financial instability, liquidity issues, or insolvency proceedings affecting their ability to manufacture our products, or if Capella's foundries and subcontractors experience production delays for other reasons, the supply of its products could be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If demand for its products increases significantly, we have no assurances that Capella's third-party foundries and subcontractors will be able to increase their manufacturing capacity to a level that meets our requirements, potentially preventing us from meeting our customer demand and harming our business and customer relationships.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, even if Capella's foundries and subcontractors are able to meet our increased demand, those third-party manufacturers may decide to charge significantly higher wafer prices to us, which could reduce our gross margin or require us to offset the increased costs by increasing prices to our customers, either of which could harm our business and operating results.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Capella's future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We could be materially adversely affected if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increases significantly or we are unsuccessful in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified personnel.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Should we lose one or more engineers who are key to a project's completion during the course of a particular project, the completion of such project may be delayed which could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Capella's historical customer base is concentrated among a few key customers, and is focused on end-users in the consumer products industry.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The delay, significant reduction in, or loss of, orders from these large customers or the consumer products industry, or demands of price concessions from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations, or could result in significant volatility in our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our credit facility and our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $437 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the recent period of economic slowdown.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately reflects the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P47_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 74% of our revenues during 2015 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 45 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	We do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P66_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Approximately 99% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As of December 31, 2015, $1,080.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Except as described in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P69_S5	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	At December 31, 2015, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 47.2% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P71_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.4% of our Class B common stock and 42.3% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Some or all of our holders of Class B common stock may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures and exchangeable notes may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible or exchangeable debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible or exchangeable debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible or exchangeable instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures and exchangeable notes could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures or exchangeable notes as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name .
103730_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the "Vishay" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the "Vishay" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_16_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2015, our business had 50 manufacturing locations.
103730_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.
103730_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some locations include both owned and leased facilities in the same location.
103730_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	The list of manufacturing facilities below excludes manufacturing facilities that are presently idle due to our restructuring activities.
103730_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment generally are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs.
103730_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	Owning many of our manufacturing facilities provides us meaningful financial and operating benefits, including long-term stability and a necessary buffer for economic downturns.
103730_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
103730_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	The principal locations of our owned manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	The principal locations of our leased manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Vishay Polytech Co., Ltd. ("VPC"), a subsidiary of Vishay which was purchased from Holy Stone Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone") in June 2014, is a named defendant, among other manufacturers, in purported antitrust class action complaints in the United States and Canada.
103730_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaints allege restraints of trade in aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors, and in some cases, film capacitors, and seek injunctive relief and unspecified joint and several treble damages.
103730_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a party to similar cases filed in Canada.
103730_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On December 9, 2015, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission ("TFTC") announced a fine of approximately $1,000,000 against VPC and concluded that VPC, along with other capacitor manufacturers, participated in meetings and had bilateral communications in which sensitive business information had been exchanged in violation of applicable antitrust laws.
103730_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The TFTC subsequently notified VPC of the TFTC's intent to grant VPC full immunity and reduce its fine to zero based on VPC's cooperation and future commitment to compliance.
103730_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	The conduct attributable to VPC occurred prior to the acquisition of that entity by Vishay.
103730_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	Holy Stone has agreed to indemnify Vishay and VPC for losses, including penalties and expenses associated with the litigation and investigation described above.
103730_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	Notwithstanding this indemnity obligation, the Company and VPC intend to defend vigorously against the civil complaints.
103730_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	Since August 2015, the Company has been named as a defendant in purported antitrust class action complaints in the United States and Canada alleging restraints of trade in resistors by the Company and other unaffiliated manufacturers, and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified joint and several treble damages.
103730_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Company intends to defend vigorously against the complaints.
103730_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_16_ITEM3_P5_S2	We are a party to disputes alleging infringement of third-party patents.
103730_16_ITEM3_P5_S3	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
103730_16_ITEM3_P6_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_16_ITEM3_P6_S1	During the past few years, we settled several suits which we had initiated to enforce our intellectual property rights.
103730_16_ITEM3_P6_S2	We are receiving royalties on sales of these companies' products which use our technology.
103730_16_ITEM3_P6_S3	We are continuing to assert our legal rights against other parties which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights.
103730_16_ITEM3_P7_S0	Vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by Vishay and its subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_16_ITEM3_P8_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM3_P9_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_16_ITEM3_P9_S1	See also Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

103730_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape for the indicated fiscal quarters.
103730_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	Holders of record of our common stock totaled approximately 1,000 at February 12, 2016.
103730_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.
103730_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	On February 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors instituted a quarterly cash dividend program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	Cash dividends of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid in each fiscal quarter of 2014 and 2015.
103730_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although the amount and timing of any future dividends remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, the high and low sales prices of our common stock and the quarterly cash dividends declared.

103730_16_ITEM6_P7_S0	As more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, effective in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we early adopted two ASUs that required retrospective adoption to previously issued financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM6_P8_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charges, restructuring and severance costs, material pension settlement charges, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains and losses on sales of property, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Discrete semiconductors and passive components manufactured by Vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronic products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	We operate in five product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
103730_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
103730_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	In 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase our ability to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends.
103730_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	Although we have no current plans, we will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	As a result of that evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense of $164.0 million, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings which we expect to repatriate to the U.S. over the next several years.
103730_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	We began implementing targeted cost reduction programs in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 to support our profitability without jeopardizing our growth plan.
103730_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	Complete implementation of these targeted cost reduction programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We initiated additional cost reduction programs in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our cost reduction programs are more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and in "Cost Management" below.
103730_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1.
103730_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, we performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with our Capella business were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges totaling $57.6 million to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	After completing step one of the goodwill impairment test, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Capacitors reporting unit was less than the net book value of that reporting unit, requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment evaluation.
103730_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Upon completion of the step two analysis for the Capacitors reporting unit, we recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $5.4 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	As part of these analyses, we determined that our indefinite-lived Siliconix tradenames were not impaired and will continue to be reported as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	T he recorded impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	If financial conditions deteriorate, an interim assessment may be required before the next annual assessment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	See additional information regarding the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests in the Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	We own and operate a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	As more fully described in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, we recorded a loss of $5.4 million related to this incident.
103730_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	The temporary shutdown adversely impacted revenues and margins of our Diodes segment (and total Vishay) for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Net revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 were relatively flat versus the prior fiscal quarter, but decreased versus the prior year quarter.
103730_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Net revenues for 2015 decreased versus 2014 and operating results are close to our expectations at this relatively low revenue level.
103730_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Ongoing weakness in several key markets and a growing skepticism concerning China burdened the economic environment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 and resulted in a decrease in many key financial metrics compared to the prior year quarter and prior quarters.
103730_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $2.300 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.493 billion and $2.371 billion for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $108.5 million, or $0.73 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $117.6 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, and $123.0 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 include items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliation below.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share do not have uniform definitions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S4	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S5	Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_16_ITEM7_P16_S6	Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	* Includes add-back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive.
103730_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our results for 2015 represent the effects of a weaker business environment in several of our customer end markets versus 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our revenue results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were negatively affected by foreign currency effects, especially from the euro, and the temporary shutdown of our diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China.
103730_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Despite the negative foreign currency effect on revenues, we were able to maintain our profitability.
103730_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	Our percentage of euro-based sales approximates our percentage of euro-based expenses so the negative foreign currency impact on revenues was substantially offset by the positive impact on expenses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	Our pre-tax results were consistent with expectations based on our business model.
103730_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	Our results for 2013 - 2014 demonstrate our ability to react quickly to changing economic environments, successfully implement cost reduction measures when necessary to sustain earnings, and organically grow our business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	We also monitor changes in our inventory turnover and our or publicly available average selling prices ("ASP").
103730_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Using our and publicly available data, we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	All pricing is subject to governing market conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	(1) Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 and the first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2015 includes $2.0 million, $1.4 million, $5.7 million, $2.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively, of restructuring and severance expenses (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Operating margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2015 includes $63.0 million of goodwill and depreciable and amortizable long-lived asset impairment charges (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	See "Financial Metrics by Segment" below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 were relatively flat versus the third fiscal quarter of 2015, and within our expected range.
103730_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues throughout 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	Our average selling prices continue to decline primarily due to our commodity semiconductor products and the effects of growing our Resistors Inductors business in Asia.
103730_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Gross margins decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The decreases are primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices and reduced volume.
103730_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Gross margins have been negatively impacted by additional depreciation associated with our cost reduction programs beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 and will continue to be negatively impacted until the complete implementation of our cost reduction programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	The book-to-bill ratio increased to 0.97 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 from 0.96 in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 1.02 and 0.91, respectively, versus ratios of 0.96 and 0.96, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our existing product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA").
103730_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay's four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, an average of approximately $100 million of revenues per year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions with a purchase price larger than $500 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we deposited the $6.8 million purchase price of Sonntag Electronic GmbH ("Sonntag").
103730_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The acquisition was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Sonntag is a distributor of electronic components in Germany.
103730_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	On June 11, 2014, we acquired Holy Stone Polytech Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone Polytech" or "Vishay Polytech Co. Ltd."), a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20.6 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	We are using the technology acquired to begin to penetrate the polymer tantalum capacitor market.
103730_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations of Holy Stone Polytech have been included in the Capacitors segment since June 11, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire Capella for approximately NT$6,051 million or $205 million at then-current exchange rates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Capella is a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic sensors that was publicly traded in Taiwan.
103730_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a first step in the acquisition, we launched a tender offer for Capella's outstanding shares.
103730_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella pursuant to the merger agreement on December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	The acquisition has strengthened the in-house design capabilities of our entire optoelectronic components business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Upon the close of the tender offer, we controlled Capella and began consolidating it in our financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations of Capella have been included in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The interest of the shares not tendered are presented as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements for the period from the conclusion of the tender offer until they were acquired on December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Due to the nature of Capella's business, $74.5 million of the purchase price was allocated to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	While we still expect that the addition of Capella will, in the mid- and long-term, add considerable value through the creation of an in-house design capability, the business has not performed as expected in its traditional end-market of smart phones.
103730_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 to write-down the acquired Capella assets to their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impairment charge.
103730_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	On June 13, 2013, we acquired MCB Industrie S.A. ("MCB Industrie") in France, a well-established manufacturer of specialty resistors and sensors, for $23.0 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired is expected to enable us to expand our presence in the European industrial market.
103730_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from June 13, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs, and use various measures and metrics to evaluate our cost structure.
103730_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	We define variable costs as expenses that vary with respect to quantity produced.
103730_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Fixed costs do not vary with respect to quantity produced over the relevant time period.
103730_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Contributive margin is calculated as net revenue less variable costs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	It may be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of net revenue.
103730_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Management uses this measure to determine the amount of profit to be expected for any change in revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	While these measures are typical cost accounting measures, none of these measures are recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	The classification of expenses as either variable or fixed is judgemental and other companies might classify such expenses differently.
103730_16_ITEM7_P52_S5	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	We closely monitor variable costs and seek to achieve the contributive margin in our business model.
103730_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Over a period of many years, we have generally maintained a contributive margin of between 46% - 48% of revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	The erosion of average selling prices, particularly of our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry and inflation negatively impact contributive margin and drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	Our variable cost reduction efforts include increasing the efficiency in our production facilities by expending capital for automation, reducing materials costs, materials substitution, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs recorded as costs of products sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses and maintaining our break-even point (adjusted for acquisitions).
103730_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	We seek to limit increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses to the rate of inflation, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	At constant fixed costs, we would expect each $1 million increase in revenues to increase our operating income by approximately $460,000 to $480,000.
103730_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	Sudden changes in the business conditions, however, may not allow us to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity and cost structure.
103730_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Occasionally, our ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate and we must take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness.
103730_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	We incurred significant restructuring expenses in our past to reduce our cost structure.
103730_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Since 2013, our cost reduction programs have primarily focused on reducing fixed costs, including selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	We recorded $5.5 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2015 for the expenses that were recognizable under GAAP during the period and $29.2 million of restructuring and severance expenses since these cost reduction programs were implemented.
103730_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	The remaining expenses associated with the programs will be recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The programs initiated in 2013 primarily focus on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees Company-wide.
103730_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	We also implemented two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	The programs in total are expected to lower costs by approximately $36 million per year when fully implemented at expected cash costs of approximately $32 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	The project for the MOSFETs segment is occurring over a period of approximately two years, ending in 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	The manufacture of wafers for certain critical products will be transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	As a consequence, certain other wafer manufacturing currently occurring in-house will be transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	The total cash costs associated with the MOSFETs initiatives, principally severance, are expected to be approximately $16 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Once fully implemented, we anticipate that the MOSFETs programs will result in an annual reduction in variable and fixed manufacturing costs of approximately $23 million at current volumes.
103730_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement offer was made to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and/or years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	The program was substantially completed in 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The total costs associated with the voluntary separation / early retirement program were approximately $13.4 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	We will realize an annual reduction in fixed costs of approximately $10 million, split approximately 35% in manufacturing and 65% in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Two other smaller cost reduction programs relate to the transfer of production of certain products within our Diodes segment, which were initiated in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	Both programs are connected to production moves, in order to take advantage of lower labor costs in one program and from the consolidation of manufacturing locations in the other.
103730_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	We will realize annual cost savings of approximately $3 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Additional programs were initiated in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The programs initiated in 2015 include a plan to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and targeted streamlining and consolidation of production for certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	The programs in total are expected to lower costs by approximately $35 million annually (at current volumes) when fully implemented, at expected cash costs of approximately $30 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	The implementation of these programs will not impact planned R D activities, or our growth initiatives in Asian markets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	We recorded $13.8 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2015 for expenses related to these programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	The remaining expenses associated with these programs will be recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The programs announced in 2015 are expected to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs by approximately $17 million annually.
103730_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	These selling, general, and administrative cost reductions should be fully achieved by the end of 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	We are first soliciting volunteers to accept a voluntary separation / early retirement offer.
103730_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	The voluntary separation benefits vary by country and job classification, but generally offer a cash loyalty bonus.
103730_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	Additional involuntary terminations will likely be necessary to achieve the cost reduction targets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The targeted plans to streamline and consolidate production of certain product lines are expected to decrease costs of products sold by approximately $18 million annually (at current volumes).
103730_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	These plans include the Zwolle, Netherlands aluminum capacitors facility closure announced on June 30, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	Except for the Zwolle facility, no other facility closures are currently expected pursuant to these programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	These production transfers will be completed in steps by the end of 2017.
103730_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	These newly announced programs do not alter or expand the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program, announced in 2013 and currently being implemented by the Company.
103730_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Although the current cost reduction plans include streamlining and consolidating production of certain product lines, only one facility closure is currently expected pursuant to these programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Except for the distinct and targeted programs noted above, we do not anticipate any other material restructuring activities in 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	We believe that we can substantially maintain our trained workforce, even at lower manufacturing activity levels, by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	However, a continued sluggish business environment for the electronics industry or the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	We have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to any of the businesses acquired since 2011, but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Even as we seek to manage our costs, we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	We plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	To foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our R D and engineering technical staff by approximately 20% since 2009; we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities; we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia by about 25% to increase our market access to the industrial segment and increase the design-in of our products in local markets; and we are directing increased funding and focus on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	These efforts as well as our broad and innovative product portfolio and strong position in distribution worldwide have us positioned very well in case of a dramatic upturn in the economy.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	Our growth plan also targets adding, through acquisitions, $100 million of revenues per year on average.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S5	Since 2011, we have acquired the specialty product businesses of Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, LLC, and MCB Industrie.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S6	In 2014, we made strategic acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech and Capella and plan to use the technology and engineering capabilities acquired to further grow our business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P71_S7	We continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities despite the current economic volatility.
103730_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our goodwill impairment tests.
103730_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	After completing step one of the goodwill impairment test, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Capacitors reporting unit was less than the net book value of that reporting unit, requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment evaluation.
103730_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	The estimated fair value of the Resistors Inductors and Optoelectronic Components reporting units exceeded the net book value of those reporting units by ratios of 2.0x and 1.3x, respectively, and no second step was required for those reporting units.
103730_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Upon completion of the step two analysis for the Capacitors reporting unit, we recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $5.4 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of October 3, 2015, the last day of the fiscal third quarter, was effectively the annual impairment test for 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	The recorded impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests.
103730_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, we performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with our Capella business were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges totaling $57.6 million to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	As part of our impairment analyses, we determined that our Siliconix tradenames, with a carrying value of $20.4 million, were not impaired and will continue to be reported as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	The estimated fair value of the Siliconix tradenames exceeded the carrying value by a narrow margin.
103730_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	They will continue to be closely monitored for impairment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	We perform our annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of October 3, 2015, the last day of the fiscal third quarter, was effectively the annual impairment test for 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	The recorded impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	We occasionally use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the "functional currency" of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	A subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company's operations generally would have the parent company's currency as its functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	The dollar generally was significantly stronger during 2015 compared to the prior years, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus the prior years.
103730_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P88_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been favorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk and forward contracts used to mitigate certain foreign currency risks.
103730_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Recording and monitoring of our sales accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_16_ITEM7_P94_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_16_ITEM7_P95_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_16_ITEM7_P95_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our goodwill impairment tests.
103730_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units required for a quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	As of December 31, 2015, one customer comprised 14.6% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	This customer comprised 14.7% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P106_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	Our U.S. plans include a plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and various non-qualified plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	The table below summarizes information about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P108_S3	This information should be read in conjunction with Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements (amounts in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for certain postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P109_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_16_ITEM7_P109_S4	We use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_16_ITEM7_P109_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_16_ITEM7_P110_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	For our U.S. qualified plan, we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk.
103730_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	Based on current market interest rate conditions and the current market value of the plan assets, our qualified defined benefit plan in the U.S. is fully-funded.
103730_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, we began the process of terminating the Company's U.S. qualified pension plan (see below).
103730_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	Accordingly, we have revised the asset allocation strategy for this plan such that all investments are in fixed income securities or cash.
103730_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Non-qualified plans in the U.S. are considered by law to be unfunded.
103730_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	However, the Company maintains assets in a rabbi trust to fund benefit payments under certain of these plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	Some non-U.S. plans also informally fund their plans by holding certain available-for-sale investments.
103730_16_ITEM7_P113_S3	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_16_ITEM7_P114_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions will be required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	Accordingly, net periodic pension cost for U.S. plans no longer include any service cost.
103730_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, the Company executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with its U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	These transactions included the purchase of annuity contracts for approximately 700 participants pursuant to an arrangement inherited in a past acquisition and a special limited-time voluntary lump-sum payment offer to certain former employees who were deferred vested participants of the plan not currently receiving periodic payments of their pension benefit.
103730_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	A total of 800 participants accepted the voluntary lump-sum offer.
103730_16_ITEM7_P117_S3	The plan is no longer obligated to pay any benefits to the 1,500 participants covered by these two settlement transactions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P117_S4	These former participants represented approximately 23% of the total participants prior to executing these transactions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P117_S5	These transactions also resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15.6 million, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, we began the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan, our U.S. qualified pension plan.
103730_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	Plan participants will not be adversely affected by the plan termination, but rather will have their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier.
103730_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	The completion of this proposed termination and settlement is contingent upon the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and meeting certain IRS and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ("PBGC") requirements, which is expected to take at least one year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	The Vishay Retirement Plan is fully-funded on a GAAP basis.
103730_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	In order to terminate the plan in accordance with IRS and PBGC requirements, we are required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary to do so.
103730_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	The amount necessary to do so is not yet known, but is currently estimated to be between zero and $35 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	We continue to seek to de-risk our pension exposures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Such actions could result in increased net periodic pension cost due to lower expected rates of return on plan assets and/or possible additional charges to recognize unamortized actuarial items if all or a portion of the obligations were to be settled.
103730_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	See Note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our income tax policies.
103730_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P124_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_16_ITEM7_P124_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	We have generally recognized net deferred tax assets only where there is a recent history of taxable income and forecasts of future taxable income.
103730_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our provision for income taxes is based on various assertions regarding future use of that cash and profits.
103730_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	Such assertions require us to consider a wide variety of U.S. federal and foreign tax laws, and the application of such laws to our operational and strategic needs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings (including $20 million of 2015 earnings and $280 million of earnings from prior periods).
103730_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	We recognized this tax expense in 2015 following an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	During 2014, the Company recognized income tax expense on foreign earnings in anticipation of a repatriation intended to repay $53 million of borrowings on its revolving credit facility used for the Capella acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 included all U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	That repatriation was completed in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	Except as described above, as of December 31, 2015, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes of foreign earnings, which are deemed to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely.
103730_16_ITEM7_P129_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	We and our subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	In 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examination of our U.S. federal tax returns through the 2011 tax year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P130_S2	The tax returns of principal non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include Germany (2009 through 2012), India (2004 through 2012), and Israel (2009 through 2012).
103730_16_ITEM7_P130_S3	We and our subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	During 2014, certain tax examinations were completed and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_16_ITEM7_P131_S1	Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes tax benefits related to the resolution of these matters.
103730_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	Statement of operations' captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Our revenue results for 2015 were negatively affected by foreign currency effects.
103730_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	Overall, the business conditions in 2014 were better than the conditions in both 2015 and 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	Our revenue results for 2014 were positively affected by increased demand for our products and overall higher demand compared to the prior year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_16_ITEM7_P137_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $83.1 million, $89.6 million, and $84.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.5%, 3.5%, and 3.4%, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P137_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were approximately $84.0 million, $87.9 million, and $83.2 million, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P137_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $3.3 million, $4.5 million, and $6.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 23.6%, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	The decrease was due primarily to lower volume and lower average selling prices.
103730_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 24.5%, as compared to 23.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher volume and our cost reduction efforts partially offset by lower average selling prices.
103730_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	Gross profit margins for the MOSFETs segment were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	Throughout 2015, the MOSFETs segment ran on a lower revenue level versus the prior year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	Revenues were negatively impacted by weak demand from distributors especially in Asia (offsetting nearly two-thirds of the gain experienced in 2014), negative impacts from declining average selling prices, and the change in the euro foreign currency exchange rate.
103730_16_ITEM7_P145_S2	The decrease in revenues was partially offset by growth in the business selling IC products and dedicated products for the automotive market.
103730_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	The gross margin percentage increased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	The increase is primarily due to inventory build associated with the restructuring program.
103730_16_ITEM7_P146_S2	Together with the realized cost reductions, the inventory build approximately offset the decline in average selling prices.
103730_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	The development in the foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively impacted revenues, positively impacted costs of sales.
103730_16_ITEM7_P147_S1	These impacts nearly completely offset at the gross margin level.
103730_16_ITEM7_P147_S2	Additional depreciation associated with our cost reduction program continued to burden the gross margin.
103730_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	Typical pricing pressure continues, although at a slightly reduced level, for our established MOSFETs products.
103730_16_ITEM7_P148_S1	We have experienced significant declines in average selling prices in both 2015 versus 2014 and 2014 versus 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P148_S2	In both years, the decline was partially supported by lower materials prices.
103730_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	In 2013, we announced a cost reduction program to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P149_S1	We continue to implement the program, which is long-term in nature and is expected to provide significant improvement beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	We continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the MOSFETs segment and continue to make capital and R D investments in this business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	Gross profit margins for the Diodes segment were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	Diodes segment revenues for 2015 decreased significantly versus the prior year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	The decrease in Asia exceeded the gain experienced in 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P154_S2	Volume gains in Europe were completely offset by negative foreign currency exchange rate effects.
103730_16_ITEM7_P154_S3	Revenues to end customers in America also increased.
103730_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	The Diodes segment was able to significantly offset the decrease in average selling prices and general cost inflation to maintain gross margin percentage in line with the prior years with a significant effort in cost reductions and in purchasing at lower prices.
103730_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	The positive impact on costs of sales from the foreign currency exchange rates could not fully offset the negative impact on revenues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	Typical pricing pressure for our established Diodes products continues.
103730_16_ITEM7_P157_S1	We have experienced a moderate price decline in 2015 versus 2014 and a slight price decline in 2014 versus 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	We own and operate a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_16_ITEM7_P158_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_16_ITEM7_P158_S3	The temporary shutdown adversely impacted 2015 revenues and margins of our Diodes segment (and total Vishay).
103730_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	The cost reduction programs announced in 2013 include two smaller projects to improve the results of the Diodes segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P159_S1	These projects, which were initiated in the third fiscal quarter of 2014 and substantially implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014, demonstrate our ongoing effort to improve the results of this segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	Gross profit margins for the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment experienced an increase in revenues primarily due to the Capella acquisition (see below).
103730_16_ITEM7_P163_S1	Revenues for the segment were significantly burdened by foreign currency exchange rate effects.
103730_16_ITEM7_P163_S2	Volume increases, especially in our existing Europe and Asia businesses, were offset by the negative impact of declining average selling prices and negative foreign currency exchange rate effects.
103730_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	The increase in revenues did not lead to an increase in gross profit margin versus prior year due to lower average selling prices and general cost inflation that was partially offset by cost reductions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P164_S1	The Capella acquisition also contributed at a lower gross margin percentage than our existing Optoelectronic Components businesses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P164_S2	The negative impact on revenues from the foreign currency exchange rate effects was partially offset by the corresponding positive impact on cost of sales.
103730_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	In both years 2015 and 2014, we experienced slight declines in average selling prices versus the prior years.
103730_16_ITEM7_P165_S1	However, the pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products slightly increased in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	In 2014, we acquired Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic products, in a two step transaction completed on December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P166_S1	Capella is included in the Optoelectronic Components segment results from the date we obtained control in September 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P166_S2	Although the Capella business has not performed as expected, we still believe that the addition of Capella has strengthened the in-house design capabilities of our entire Optoelectronic Components business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	In the third fiscal quarter of 2015, we recorded long-lived depreciable and amortizable asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	Gross profit margins for the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	The Resistors Inductors segment reported lower net revenues in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	The increase in sales volume was not enough to offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a decline in average selling prices.
103730_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	The revenue decline is most significant in Europe, mainly due to the weaker euro.
103730_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	Net revenues in Asia are relatively flat versus the prior year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P173_S1	Virtually all industry segments contributed to the revenue decline.
103730_16_ITEM7_P173_S2	Sales to distributors and the industrial market experienced the largest declines, representing more than 50% of the revenue decline on a yearly basis.
103730_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	Despite significant savings in operating costs and lower metals/materials prices, the gross profit margin declined primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a slight decrease in average selling prices, and inflationary effects.
103730_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	Average selling prices declined slightly in both 2015 versus 2014 and 2014 versus 2013, consistent with our historical experience.
103730_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	In 2015, we announced global cost reduction programs which include targeted plans to streamline and consolidate certain product lines, including within our Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P176_S1	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	Gross profit margins for the Capacitors segment were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment have decreased significantly versus the prior year.
103730_16_ITEM7_P180_S1	All regions experienced a decline with Europe, which is negatively impacted by the foreign currency exchange rates, experiencing the sharpest decline.
103730_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	Sales to the industrial market were significantly reduced, mainly due to the discontinuation of government spending for renewable energy projects and the lower spending activities in the oil and gas industry.
103730_16_ITEM7_P181_S1	Sales to the automotive segment also declined significantly.
103730_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	Significant savings from the cost reduction program initiated in 2015 (see below), along with metal/material price savings, were not sufficient to fully offset the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary effects.
103730_16_ITEM7_P182_S1	As a result, the gross profit margin declined versus 2014, but improved in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 versus the two prior fiscal quarters.
103730_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	The average selling prices declined slightly versus the prior years, consistent with our historical experience.
103730_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	On June 11, 2014, we acquired Holy Stone Polytech, a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20.6 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_16_ITEM7_P184_S1	We are using the technology acquired to begin to penetrate the polymer tantalum capacitor market.
103730_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	In 2015, we announced global cost reduction programs which include targeted plans to streamline and consolidate certain product lines, including within our Capacitors segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P185_S1	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	In the third fiscal quarter of 2015, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $5.4 million in the Capacitors segment.
103730_16_ITEM7_P186_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	The overall decrease in SG A expenses in 2015 versus 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects, the benefits of our voluntary separation / early retirement program (see "Cost Management" above), and the non-repetition of additional SG A expenses incurred in 2014 to close acquisitions, partially offset by SG A expenses of acquired companies and additional compensation costs in general.
103730_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	The overall increase in SG A expenses in 2014 versus 2013 is primarily attributable to the non-repetition of temporary cost containment measures implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2013, SG A expenses of acquired companies, and additional compensation costs in general, partially offset by the benefits of our voluntary separation / early retirement program.
103730_16_ITEM7_P188_S2	We also incurred additional SG A expenses in 2014 to close the Holy Stone Polytech and Capella acquisitions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P189_S0	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P190_S0	The acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech in the second fiscal quarter of 2014 and a controlling interest in Capella in the third fiscal quarter of 2014 increased our amortizable intangible assets balance by $78.2 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P190_S1	We recognized amortizable intangible asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P190_S2	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impairment charges and an estimate of our annual amortization expense through 2020.
103730_16_ITEM7_P190_S3	Additional acquisition activity will increase these amounts.
103730_16_ITEM7_P191_S0	In 2013 and 2015, we announced restructuring programs targeting SG A expenses.
103730_16_ITEM7_P192_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $1.2 million versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P192_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P193_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P194_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.3 million versus the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P194_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P195_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_16_ITEM7_P196_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the effective tax rates were 244.1%, 29.5%, and 29.8%, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P196_S1	The effective tax rates are generally less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
103730_16_ITEM7_P196_S2	While our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory rate, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is impacted by the tax-effect of the planned cash repatriation described below, and by a write-off of non-deductible goodwill and an impairment charge in a lower tax-rate jurisdiction.
103730_16_ITEM7_P197_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 include certain discrete tax items for repatriation transactions, changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_16_ITEM7_P197_S1	These items were $152.4 million in 2015, $1.2 million (tax benefit) in 2014, and $4.2 million (tax benefit) in 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P198_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the discrete items include $164.0 million of expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily to repatriate $300.0 million of foreign earnings to the United States, following an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P198_S1	It also includes $11.6 million (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions, the release of valuation allowances, and the effect of statutory tax rate changes on deferred taxes.
103730_16_ITEM7_P199_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discrete items included a $1.2 million benefit recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the enactment of The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 that retroactively extended certain tax benefits from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P199_S1	The discrete items also included tax benefits upon the completion of certain tax examinations and lapses in the statute of limitations, offset by additional tax expenses for expected repatriation of cash and profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States, primarily to repay amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility to provide future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM7_P199_S2	The latter two items netted to an immaterial amount.
103730_16_ITEM7_P200_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the discrete items included a $2.9 million benefit recorded in the third fiscal quarter due to a new tax law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increased the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increased our deferred tax assets, and a $1.3 million benefit recorded in the first fiscal quarter due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM7_P201_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_16_ITEM7_P201_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_16_ITEM7_P201_S2	Part of our strategy has been to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_16_ITEM7_P201_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate, except in 2015 as described above.
103730_16_ITEM7_P202_S0	Changes in the effective tax rate are usually attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions, except in 2015 as described above.
103730_16_ITEM7_P203_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P204_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_16_ITEM7_P204_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy, to reduce debt levels, and to pay dividends and repurchase stock.
103730_16_ITEM7_P204_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 14 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 21 years.
103730_16_ITEM7_P205_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as "free cash," a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_16_ITEM7_P205_S1	Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 19 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 14 years.
103730_16_ITEM7_P205_S2	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_16_ITEM7_P206_S0	We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash in line with our history during the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P206_S1	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_16_ITEM7_P207_S0	Beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we have reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company's capital structure.
103730_16_ITEM7_P207_S1	We have completed three issuances of low-coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance.
103730_16_ITEM7_P207_S2	We utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase approximately 24% of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives.
103730_16_ITEM7_P208_S0	We also entered into a new, larger, revolving credit facility in 2010, which was amended and restated on August 8, 2013, and further amended and restated on December 10, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P208_S1	The amended and restated credit facility provides an aggregate commitment of $640 million of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020, and we have the ability to request up to $50 million of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P208_S2	The previous credit agreement was scheduled to mature on August 8, 2018.
103730_16_ITEM7_P208_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $190 million and $200 million, respectively, were outstanding under our credit facility.
103730_16_ITEM7_P209_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_16_ITEM7_P209_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
103730_16_ITEM7_P209_S2	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_16_ITEM7_P209_S3	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_16_ITEM7_P210_S0	We also pay a fee, also based on our leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts.
103730_16_ITEM7_P210_S1	The undrawn commitment fee, based on our current leverage ratio, is 0.35% per annum.
103730_16_ITEM7_P210_S2	Such undrawn commitment fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_16_ITEM7_P210_S3	Prior to the December 10, 2015 amendment and restatement, the credit agreement required Vishay to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount.
103730_16_ITEM7_P211_S0	The amended and restated credit facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends to stockholders and share repurchases, provided our pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_16_ITEM7_P211_S1	If our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the credit facility allows such payments up to $75 million per annum (subject to a cap of $225 million for the term of the facility).
103730_16_ITEM7_P212_S0	The amendment and restatement of the credit facility also removed certain restrictions related to intercompany transactions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P212_S1	These changes are expected to enable us to streamline our complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_16_ITEM7_P213_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P213_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P213_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM7_P214_S0	The credit facility also limits or restricts us, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, and making asset sales, and making other restricted payments (assuming our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1), and requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_16_ITEM7_P215_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_16_ITEM7_P215_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article VI of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 10, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P216_S0	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P216_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 11.12 to 1 and 2.11 to 1, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM7_P216_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_16_ITEM7_P217_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_16_ITEM7_P217_S1	Additionally, our exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102 and our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_16_ITEM7_P218_S0	The balance of our revolving credit facility was $200 million at December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P218_S1	We borrowed $316 million and repaid $326 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P218_S2	We borrowed $53 million in 2014 to partially fund the Capella acquisition while achieving future flexibility given the legal entity and financial structure utilized for the acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM7_P218_S3	We repatriated cash from 2014 earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings.
103730_16_ITEM7_P218_S4	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $190 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $215 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P219_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, our convertible senior debentures are convertible by the holders under certain circumstances.
103730_16_ITEM7_P219_S1	The convertible senior debentures are not currently convertible, but the conversion criteria of the debentures will continue to be evaluated and the debentures may become convertible in the future.
103730_16_ITEM7_P219_S2	At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of our common stock.
103730_16_ITEM7_P219_S3	We intend to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under our credit facility.
103730_16_ITEM7_P220_S0	Management expects to periodically pay down the balance of our revolving credit facility with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P220_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, regular dividend payments, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P220_S2	Additional acquisition activity, share repurchases, or conversion of our convertible debentures may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_16_ITEM7_P220_S3	No principal payments on our outstanding debt are due before the maturity of our revolving credit facility in December 2020.
103730_16_ITEM7_P221_S0	As of December 31, 2015, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_16_ITEM7_P221_S1	Certain payments, such as cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_16_ITEM7_P221_S2	Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs.
103730_16_ITEM7_P222_S0	Our substantially undrawn credit facility provides us with significant liquidity in the United States.
103730_16_ITEM7_P223_S0	As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM7_P223_S1	As a result of that evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings which we expect to repatriate to the U.S. over the next several years.
103730_16_ITEM7_P224_S0	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividend payments remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_16_ITEM7_P224_S1	However, the amended and restated credit facility provides us with significantly more flexibility to execute these transactions, and our ability to utilize some of our foreign-source income for these types of transactions provides even further financial flexibility.
103730_16_ITEM7_P225_S0	Except as described above and in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_16_ITEM7_P225_S1	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions .
103730_16_ITEM7_P226_S0	We invest a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM7_P226_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_16_ITEM7_P227_S0	The interest rates on our short-term investments average 0.43% and are approximately 14 basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_16_ITEM7_P227_S1	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_16_ITEM7_P228_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively (in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P229_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_16_ITEM7_P230_S0	Measurements such as "free cash" and "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_16_ITEM7_P230_S1	Such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_16_ITEM7_P230_S2	However, management believes that "free cash" is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends, and that an analysis of "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_16_ITEM7_P230_S3	These measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_16_ITEM7_P231_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2015 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.1 to 1, as compared to 4.3 to 1 as of December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P231_S1	The decrease is primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable.
103730_16_ITEM7_P231_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity was 0.27 to 1 at December 31, 2015 as compared to a ratio of 0.24 to 1 at December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P231_S3	The increase in the ratio is primarily due to the net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders incurred in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P232_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $245.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $297.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P233_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $147.1 million, as compared to $157.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P233_S1	We expect capital spending of approximately $150 million in 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P234_S0	Cash paid for the purchase and deposits for businesses, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.8 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P234_S1	The amount represents a deposit made in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, for the acquisition Sonntag, which was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P235_S0	Cash paid for the purchase and deposits for businesses, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $198.0 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P235_S1	The Capella acquisition accounts for $177.4 million of the reported cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P235_S2	The $47.4 million of short-term investments acquired in the Capella acquisition are not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_16_ITEM7_P235_S3	The $21.1 million paid to acquire the noncontrolling interests in Capella on December 31, 2014 is reported as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_16_ITEM7_P236_S0	Cash paid for dividends to our common and Class B common stockholders totalled $35.4 million for both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7_P236_S1	On February 16, 2016, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend payment by 4% to $0.0625 per share.
103730_16_ITEM7_P236_S2	We expect dividend payments in 2016 to total approximately $37.0 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P236_S3	However, any future dividend declaration and payment remains subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
103730_16_ITEM7_P237_S0	As of December 31, 2015 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM7_P238_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_16_ITEM7_P238_S1	Accordingly, the discounts and capitalized deferred financing costs associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_16_ITEM7_P239_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement, one of which bears a maturity date of 2102, and include fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on December 10, 2020.
103730_16_ITEM7_P239_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042.
103730_16_ITEM7_P240_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_16_ITEM7_P240_S1	Among other things, approximately $614 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.
103730_16_ITEM7_P240_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_16_ITEM7_P240_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our variable-rate exchangeable notes due 2102 and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2015, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_16_ITEM7_P241_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 includes liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_16_ITEM7_P241_S1	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM7_P241_S2	Accordingly, we have classified the amount recorded as a current liability as payable within one year, and the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_16_ITEM7_P242_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_16_ITEM7_P242_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_16_ITEM7_P242_S2	See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_16_ITEM7_P242_S3	These obligations were not material to us as of December 31, 2015, and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above.
103730_16_ITEM7_P243_S0	Expected pension and postretirement plan funding is based on a projected schedule of benefit payments under the plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P244_S0	As discussed above and in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, we are in the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan, our U.S. qualified pension plan.
103730_16_ITEM7_P244_S1	In order to terminate the plan in accordance with IRS and PBGC requirements, we are required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary to do so.
103730_16_ITEM7_P244_S2	The amount necessary to do so is not yet known, but is currently estimated to be between zero and $35 million.
103730_16_ITEM7_P244_S3	The table above does not include any amounts for the potential funding requirements to terminate the U.S. qualified pension plan, but includes $16.0 million planned to be contributed to our Taiwanese pension plans in 2016 to improve the funded status of those plans.
103730_16_ITEM7_P245_S0	We maintain long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_16_ITEM7_P245_S1	We typically have minimum purchase commitments of $30 million to $40 million per year pursuant to our long-term foundry agreements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P245_S2	We continue to work with Tower Semiconductor and anticipate having minimum purchase requirements in the future.
103730_16_ITEM7_P245_S3	At December 31, 2015, the extent of those commitments is under discussion with Tower Semiconductor, following the transfer of certain manufacturing processes among Tower Semiconductor's facilities.
103730_16_ITEM7_P246_S0	Other long-term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7_P246_S1	We include the current portion of the long-term liabilities in the table above.
103730_16_ITEM7_P246_S2	Other long-term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_16_ITEM7_P247_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM7_P248_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_16_ITEM7_P249_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_16_ITEM7_P249_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition and other market conditions, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_16_ITEM7_P250_S0	See also "Commodity Price Risk" included in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional related information.
103730_16_ITEM7_P251_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .
103730_16_ITEM7_P251_S1	The ASU is the result of the FASB's simplification initiative intended to improve GAAP by reducing costs and complexity while maintaining or enhancing the usefulness of related financial statement information.
103730_16_ITEM7_P251_S2	The ASU eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively, and to instead recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which the acquirer determines the amount, including the effect on earnings of any amounts which would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
103730_16_ITEM7_P251_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
103730_16_ITEM7_P251_S4	The ASU will have no effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The exchangeable notes, of which $38.6 million are outstanding, bear interest at LIBOR (reset quarterly).
103730_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2015, we had $190.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2015, we have $475.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $619.0 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2015, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $3.0 million.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Also see "Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of these exposures.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We entered into forward contracts with a highly-rated financial institution to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The notional amount of the forward contracts was $29.0 million as of December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The forward contracts settle monthly and are expected to be renewed at our discretion on a monthly basis until the intercompany loans are repaid.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P9_S3	The forward contracts were renewed on the last day of the year.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P9_S4	We have not designated the forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and as such the change in the fair value of contracts is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	We do not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S6	Where possible, we maintain local currency denominated cash balances in these countries approximately equal to the local currency liabilities to naturally hedge our exposures.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S7	We also have a slightly higher percentage of euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S8	Therefore, when the euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is slightly increased.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P11_S9	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses of our consolidated foreign exchange risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $7.8 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P12_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange gains of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P13_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P14_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P16_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P16_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P17_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P17_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P18_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P18_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P19_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P19_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_16_ITEM7A_P20_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $5.0 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.
103730_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1 of this report.
103730_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

103730_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Ernst Young LLP has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein on page F-3.
103730_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
103730_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The certifications of our CEO and CFO pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

103730_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s management.
103730_16_ITEM15_P49_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
103730_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_16_ITEM15_P56_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated February 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2015 through the date these financial statements were issued through the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
103730_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, "stock, ship and debit" credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_16_ITEM15_P67_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_16_ITEM15_P67_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $3,323, $4,525, and $6,362 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $64,193, $65,299, and $62,090, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_16_ITEM15_P73_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of "more likely than not" to be realized.
103730_16_ITEM15_P73_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P73_S4	If the Company's assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_16_ITEM15_P73_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Except as described in Note 5, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_16_ITEM15_P74_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P76_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.

103730_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

103730_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	Certain of the Company's tradenames have been assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_16_ITEM15_P87_S3	The Company's business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P87_S4	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment tests performed in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.

103730_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_16_ITEM15_P89_S2	If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not required.
103730_16_ITEM15_P89_S3	If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is required.
103730_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets before performing a quantitative impairment test.
103730_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	The fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for anticipated disposal costs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment tests performed in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	Short-term investments and other assets reported on the consolidated balance sheets include time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year and investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11), assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S., and as of December 31, 2014, short-term investments acquired in the Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. ("Capella") acquisition (see Note 2), which matured in 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_16_ITEM15_P98_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until sold.
103730_16_ITEM15_P98_S4	At the time of sale, the assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_16_ITEM15_P101_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_16_ITEM15_P101_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company uses financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to mitigate a portion, but not all, of the risk associated with its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	The purpose of the Company's foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, held-to-maturity short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P104_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs") that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_16_ITEM15_P109_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM15_P109_S2	The Company's operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_16_ITEM15_P110_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_16_ITEM15_P110_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_16_ITEM15_P112_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2015 and 2014 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	Restructuring and severance costs reflect charges resulting from cost reduction programs implemented by the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	Restructuring and severance costs include exit costs, severance benefits pursuant to an on-going arrangement, voluntary termination compensation under a defined program, and any related pension curtailment and settlement charges.
103730_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company recognizes expense for one-time benefits only after management has committed to a plan, the plan is sufficiently detailed to provide the number, classification, and location of employees to be terminated as well as the expected completion date, the plan has been sufficiently communicated to employees such that they are able to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if terminated, and it is unlikely that the plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.
103730_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	If an employee is not required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense once the aforementioned criteria have been met.
103730_16_ITEM15_P115_S2	If an employee is required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense over the period that the employee is required to render future service.
103730_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company recognizes expense for on-going benefit arrangements when the liability is reasonably estimable and considered probable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company recognizes expense for voluntary separation / early retirement when the employee delivers an irrevocable voluntary termination notice pursuant to a defined company program.
103730_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Company recognizes other exit costs as incurred.
103730_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers' liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	At December 31, 2015, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors' and officers' insurance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P120_S2	The captive insurance entity had $5,000 accrued related to the Tianjin explosion at December 31, 2015, and had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	Restricted cash of $11,627 and $7,309 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_16_ITEM15_P122_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P122_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .
103730_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	The ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
103730_16_ITEM15_P124_S2	The ASU removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; provides more useful information to users of financial statements through expanded disclosure requirements; and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.
103730_16_ITEM15_P124_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with the ability to early adopt on January 1, 2017.
103730_16_ITEM15_P124_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its revenue contracts and its adoption alternatives.
103730_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, Vishay adopted accounting guidance that required retrospective adjustment to previously issued financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P125_S1	All prior period data presented in these consolidated financial statements reflect the retrospective adoption of this guidance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs .
103730_16_ITEM15_P126_S1	The ASU is the result of the FASB's simplification initiative intended to improve GAAP by reducing costs and complexity while maintaining or enhancing the usefulness of related financial statement information.
103730_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	The ASU specifies that debt issuance costs related to a note shall be reported in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the face amount of the note.
103730_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	The Company early adopted the ASU in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P127_S2	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03, the Company reclassified its capitalized debt issuance costs previously recorded within Other Assets to a contra-liability reducing Long-term Debt on the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P127_S3	The reclassification was $10,867 as of December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P127_S4	The ASU had no effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .
103730_16_ITEM15_P128_S1	The ASU is the result of the FASB's simplification initiative intended to improve GAAP by reducing costs and complexity while maintaining or enhancing the usefulness of related financial statement information.
103730_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	The ASU amends the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts to require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
103730_16_ITEM15_P129_S1	The Company early adopted the ASU in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P129_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the balance of the current deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets were $17,815 and $9,790, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P129_S3	The ASU had no effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	In addition to the changes due to the retrospective adoption of new accounting guidance described above, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.

103730_16_ITEM15_P134_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations of Holy Stone Polytech have been included in the Capacitors segment since June 11, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P134_S3	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P134_S4	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $3,736 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.

103730_16_ITEM15_P136_S8	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in December 31, 2014, the Company repatriated cash from the current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_16_ITEM15_P136_S9	The acquisition has strengthened the in-house design capabilities of our entire optoelectronic components business.
103730_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	Upon the close of the tender offer, Vishay controlled Capella and began consolidating it in its financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations and net assets of Capella are included in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P138_S1	Capella's results were not material to the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P139_S0	Vishay acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella on December 31, 2014 pursuant to the merger agreement.
103730_16_ITEM15_P139_S1	In connection with the closing of the merger, all remaining holders of Capella common stock other than Vishay and its subsidiaries received the same consideration for their shares as the holders who tendered their shares in the tender offer, or $21,067 in the aggregate.
103730_16_ITEM15_P140_S0	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	The weighted average useful lives for patents and acquired technology, customer relationships, and tradenames are 10, 7, and 7 years, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P141_S1	The goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	In evaluating the acquisition of Capella, the Company focused primarily on the ability to synergize Capella's optoelectronics design capabilities with Vishay's existing optoelectronics product lines and customers.
103730_16_ITEM15_P142_S1	As a result, the fair value of the acquired assets, including identified intangible assets, corresponds to a relatively smaller portion of the acquisition price, with the Company recording a substantial amount of goodwill associated with the acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	The Company recognized impairment charges of $57,600 in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 to write-down acquired Capella assets to their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P143_S1	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment charges.
103730_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	The Company recognized $843 of acquisition costs classified as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	The unaudited pro forma results would have been as follows, assuming the 2014 acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2013:
103730_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	The pro forma information presented for the year ended December 31, 2014 was adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs incurred in 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P146_S1	The pro forma information also includes adjustments for interest expense that would have been incurred to finance the acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets (excluding effects of the 2015 impairment charges), depreciation of acquired property and equipment, and tax related effects.
103730_16_ITEM15_P147_S0	The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been attained had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	On June 13, 2013, Vishay acquired MCB Industrie S.A. ("MCB Industrie") in France, a well-established manufacturer of specialty resistors and sensors, for $23,034, net of cash acquired.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S1	The products and technology portfolio acquired enabled Vishay to expand its presence in the European industrial market.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations for this business have been included in the Resistors Inductors segment from June 13, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S3	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S4	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $5,433 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S5	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $7,985 related to this acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM15_P148_S6	The goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P149_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_16_ITEM15_P150_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and its peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described in Note 4), Vishay determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P151_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with the Company's Capella business were not recoverable, and the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $57,600 to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	After completing step one of the goodwill impairment test, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Capacitors reporting unit was less than the net book value of that reporting unit, requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment evaluation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P152_S1	The estimated fair value of the Resistors Inductors and Optoelectronic Components reporting units exceeded the net book value of those reporting units by ratios of 2.0x and 1.3x, respectively, and no second step was required for those reporting units.
103730_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	Upon completion of the step two analysis for the Capacitors reporting unit, the Company recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $5,380.
103730_16_ITEM15_P154_S0	As part of these analyses, the Company determined that its Siliconix tradenames, with a carrying value of $20,359, were not impaired and will continue to be reported as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P154_S1	The estimated fair value of the Siliconix tradenames exceeded the carrying value by a narrow margin.
103730_16_ITEM15_P154_S2	They will continue to be closely monitored for impairment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	The fair value of long-lived assets is measured primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P155_S2	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	The fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P157_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	The fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes is measured primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the reporting unit.
103730_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	The calculated results are evaluated for reasonableness using comparable company data.
103730_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P159_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_16_ITEM15_P161_S1	Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge; could have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	The Company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of October 3, 2015, the last day of the third fiscal quarter, was effectively the annual impairment test for 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	The recorded impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect Vishay's liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $21,829, $18,651, and $15,068, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	The Company places a strong emphasis on controlling its costs and combats general price inflation by continuously improving its efficiency and operating performance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P168_S1	When the ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate, the Company takes actions to maintain its cost competitiveness.
103730_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Company incurred significant restructuring costs in its past to reduce its cost structure.
103730_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	Historically, the Company's primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P170_S1	Since 2013, the Company's cost reduction programs have primarily focused on reducing fixed costs, including selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	In 2013, the Company announced various cost reduction programs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	The cash costs of these programs, primarily severance, are expected to be approximately $32,000.
103730_16_ITEM15_P171_S2	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_16_ITEM15_P171_S3	Many of the severance costs will be recognized ratably over the required stay periods.
103730_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	In 2015, the Company announced additional global cost reduction programs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	These programs include a facility closure in the Netherlands.
103730_16_ITEM15_P172_S2	The cash costs of these programs, primarily severance, are expected to aggregate to approximately $30,000.
103730_16_ITEM15_P172_S3	Complete implementation of these programs is expected to occur before the end of 2017.
103730_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	The following table summarizes restructuring and related expenses which were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 and reported on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:
103730_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	Over a period of approximately 2 years and in a period of discrete steps, the manufacture of wafers for a substantial share of products is being transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_16_ITEM15_P174_S1	As a consequence, certain other manufacturing currently occurring in-house will be transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The total costs associated with these initiatives, generally severance, are expected to be approximately $16,000.
103730_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	Employees generally must remain with the Company during the production transfer period.
103730_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	Accordingly, the Company will accrue these severance costs ratably over the respective employees' remaining service periods.
103730_16_ITEM15_P176_S2	The Company may incur other exit costs associated with the production transfer, including certain contract termination costs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P178_S1	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement program was offered to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	The program benefits varied by country and job classification, but generally included a cash loyalty bonus based on years of service.
103730_16_ITEM15_P179_S2	All employees eligible for the program have left the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	These employees generally were not aligned with any particular segment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	The effective separation / retirement date for most employees who accepted the offer was June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a transition period.
103730_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The payment terms vary by country, but generally were paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	Certain participants are being paid in installments.
103730_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	In an effort to reduce costs and streamline production of its module products within its Diodes segment, the Company committed to two smaller cost reduction programs related to the transferring of production of certain of its products.
103730_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P185_S1	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	The global cost reduction programs announced in 2015 include a plan to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and targeted streamlining and consolidation of production for certain product lines within its Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	The following table summarizes the expense recognized by segment related to this program:
103730_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P189_S1	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
103730_16_ITEM15_P190_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and noncontrolling interests consists of the following components:
103730_16_ITEM15_P191_S0	Significant components of income taxes are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P192_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P192_S1	Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Company makes significant judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets (principally net operating losses).
103730_16_ITEM15_P193_S1	The carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize these assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
103730_16_ITEM15_P194_S0	A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax provision is as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P195_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 includes certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_16_ITEM15_P195_S1	These items total $152,437, $1,228 (tax benefit), and $4,197 (tax benefit) in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P196_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the discrete items include $163,954 of expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily to repatriate $300,000 of foreign earnings to the United States, following an evaluation of the Company's anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and the Company's most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P196_S1	It also includes $11,517 (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions, the release of valuation allowances, and the effect of statutory tax rate changes on deferred taxes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discrete items include a $1,228 benefit recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the enactment of The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P197_S1	The discrete items also include benefits upon the completion of certain tax examinations and lapses in the statute of limitations, offset by additional tax expenses for expected repatriation of cash and profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States, primarily to repay amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility to provide future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM15_P197_S2	The latter two items netted to an immaterial amount.
103730_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the discrete items include a $2,867 benefit recorded in the third fiscal quarter due to a new tax law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases the deferred tax assets, and a $1,330 benefit recorded in the first fiscal quarter due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had the following significant net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes:
103730_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	Approximately $57,603 of the carryforwards in Belgium resulted from the Company's acquisition of BCcomponents in 2002.
103730_16_ITEM15_P200_S1	Valuation allowances of $19,579 and $21,833, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, have been recorded through goodwill for these acquired net operating losses.
103730_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had the following significant tax credit carryforwards available:
103730_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	At December 31, 2015, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,382,749 of foreign earnings, which are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_16_ITEM15_P202_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P203_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P204_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company recognized income tax expense, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300,000 of foreign earnings, (including $20,000 of 2015 earnings and $280,000 of earnings from prior periods).
103730_16_ITEM15_P204_S1	This tax expense was recognized in 2015 following an evaluation of the Company's anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and the Company's most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	During 2014, the Company recognized income tax expense on foreign earnings in anticipation of a repatriation intended to pay $53,000 of borrowings on its revolving credit facility used for the Capella acquisition (see Note 2).
103730_16_ITEM15_P205_S1	The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 included all U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P205_S2	That repatriation was completed in 2015 .
103730_16_ITEM15_P206_S0	Net income taxes paid were $49,301, $62,051, and $44,757 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P207_S0	See Note 19 for a discussion of the tax-related uncertainties for the pre-spin-off period of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("VPG"), which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_16_ITEM15_P208_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_16_ITEM15_P209_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits of $23,527 and $26,583, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized.
103730_16_ITEM15_P210_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_16_ITEM15_P210_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $3,887 and $3,104, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P210_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recognized $785, $1,839, and $2,218, respectively, in interest and penalties.
103730_16_ITEM15_P211_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P211_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, certain tax examinations were completed and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_16_ITEM15_P211_S2	The tax provision for those years includes adjustments related to the resolution of these matters, as reflected in the table above.
103730_16_ITEM15_P212_S0	In 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examination of Vishay's U.S. federal tax returns through the 2011 tax year.
103730_16_ITEM15_P212_S1	The tax returns of other non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include Germany (2009 through 2012), India (2004 through 2012), and Israel (2009 through 2012).
103730_16_ITEM15_P212_S2	The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P213_S0	The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that result from such examinations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P213_S1	These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current unrecognized tax benefits.
103730_16_ITEM15_P213_S2	The Company believes that in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations will conclude or the statutes of limitation on certain income tax periods open to examination will expire, or both.
103730_16_ITEM15_P213_S3	Given the uncertainties described above, the Company can only determine an estimate of potential decreases in unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $110 to $5,240.
103730_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P215_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility").
103730_16_ITEM15_P215_S1	On December 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate commitment of $640,000 of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020.
103730_16_ITEM15_P215_S2	The credit agreement initially became effective December 1, 2010 and was first amended and restated on August 8, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P215_S3	The Credit Facility, as amended and restated, also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $50,000 of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P216_S0	Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_16_ITEM15_P216_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on Vishay's leverage ratio.
103730_16_ITEM15_P217_S0	Based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_16_ITEM15_P217_S1	Vishay also pays a fee, also based on its leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts.
103730_16_ITEM15_P217_S2	The undrawn commitment fee, based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, is 0.35% per annum.
103730_16_ITEM15_P217_S3	The previous credit agreement required Vishay to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount.
103730_16_ITEM15_P218_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_16_ITEM15_P218_S1	If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows such payments up to $75,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $225,000 for the term of the facility).
103730_16_ITEM15_P219_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P219_S1	Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P219_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P219_S3	The Credit Facility also limits or restricts the Company and its subsidiaries, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its respective assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and making other restricted payments (assuming the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1), and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_16_ITEM15_P220_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility also removes certain restrictions related to intercompany transactions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P220_S1	These changes are expected to enable the Company to streamline its complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_16_ITEM15_P221_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, material misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P221_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the Company's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_16_ITEM15_P222_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was $442,745 and $432,445, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.
103730_16_ITEM15_P222_S1	Letters of credit totaling $7,255 and $7,555 were outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P223_S0	Vishay currently has three issuances of convertible senior debentures outstanding with generally congruent terms.
103730_16_ITEM15_P223_S1	The quarterly cash dividend program of the Company results in adjustments to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for each issuance of the Company's convertible senior debentures effective as of the ex-dividend date of each cash dividend.
103730_16_ITEM15_P224_S0	The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the three series of outstanding convertible senior debentures following the adjustment made to the conversion rate of the debentures on the ex-dividend date of the December 22, 2015 dividend payment:
103730_16_ITEM15_P225_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_16_ITEM15_P226_S0	Based on an evaluation of the conversion criteria at December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, or due 2042 were convertible.
103730_16_ITEM15_P226_S1	The conversion criteria of the debentures will continue to be evaluated and the debentures may become convertible in the future.
103730_16_ITEM15_P226_S2	The debentures are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of Vishay's common stock or a combination thereof, at Vishay's option, at the conversion rate.
103730_16_ITEM15_P226_S3	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon future conversion of any of the convertible senior debentures, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P226_S4	The Company intends to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under its credit facility.
103730_16_ITEM15_P227_S0	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "fundamental change" in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_16_ITEM15_P228_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to the respective call dates.
103730_16_ITEM15_P228_S1	On or after the call date and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay's common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_16_ITEM15_P229_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_16_ITEM15_P229_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_16_ITEM15_P230_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P231_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company's estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P231_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances beginning ten years subsequent to issuance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P232_S0	Interest expense related to the debentures is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
103730_16_ITEM15_P233_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_16_ITEM15_P233_S1	The notes are governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_16_ITEM15_P233_S2	The notes may be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, may be called by Vishay for similar consideration.
103730_16_ITEM15_P234_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes are deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_16_ITEM15_P235_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spin-off, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,042 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_16_ITEM15_P235_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_16_ITEM15_P236_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement the holders may at any time put the notes to Vishay in exchange for shares of Vishay's common stock, and Vishay may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.
103730_16_ITEM15_P236_S1	Subsequent to the spin-off of VPG, the put/call rate of the Vishay notes is $15.39 per share of common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P237_S0	The payment of quarterly cash dividends does not result in an adjustment to the put/call rate of the notes (See Note 7).
103730_16_ITEM15_P238_S0	In 2013, a holder of the notes exercised its option to exchange $56,400 principal amount of the notes for 3,664,729 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P238_S1	Following this transaction, Vishay had outstanding exchangeable unsecured notes with a principal amount of $38,642, which are exchangeable for an aggregate of 2,511,742 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P239_S0	The notes bear interest at LIBOR.
103730_16_ITEM15_P239_S1	Interest continues to be payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each calendar year.
103730_16_ITEM15_P240_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P241_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P241_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_16_ITEM15_P242_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $13,700, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_16_ITEM15_P243_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $16,700, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_16_ITEM15_P244_S0	Interest paid was $19,134, $18,394, and $17,647 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P245_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
103730_16_ITEM15_P246_S0	The Company's Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share while the common stock carries 1 vote per share.
103730_16_ITEM15_P246_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P246_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P246_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P247_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P247_S1	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_16_ITEM15_P247_S2	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.
103730_16_ITEM15_P248_S0	On February 3, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.
103730_16_ITEM15_P248_S1	Cash dividends of $0.06 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid on March 25, 2015, June 25, 2015, September 24, 2015, December 22, 2015, March 27, 2014, June 26, 2014, September 18, 2014, and December 16, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2015, June 11, 2015, September 2, 2015, December 3, 2015, March 3, 2014, June 12, 2014, August 28, 2014, and November 26, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P248_S2	The amount and timing of any future dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_16_ITEM15_P249_S1	If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows such payments up to $75,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $225,000 for the term of the facility).
103730_16_ITEM15_P249_S2	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividends remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P250_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P251_S0	*At December 31, 2015, the convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are convertible into 20,544,893, 8,177,775, and 13,175,925 shares, respectively, of Vishay common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P251_S1	The Company has reserved adequate shares to ensure it could issue the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_16_ITEM15_P252_S0	The caption "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P253_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_16_ITEM15_P253_S1	Vishay owns and operates a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_16_ITEM15_P253_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_16_ITEM15_P253_S3	Full production resumed on September 8, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	As a result of this incident, through the end of 2015, the Company estimates that it has incurred $9,946 for inventory, property, and equipment damage (at net book value) and related repair and clean-up costs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P254_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded a receivable of $4,596 for amounts which are probable of recovery under its insurance policies.
103730_16_ITEM15_P254_S2	The accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes, as a separate line item, a loss of $5,350 related to these items, which represents the insurance deductible and certain costs which are potentially not recoverable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P255_S0	The Company's insurance coverage generally provides for replacement cost of damaged items.
103730_16_ITEM15_P255_S1	Any amount expected to be received in excess of the book value of the damaged item will be treated as a gain, but will not be recorded until contingencies are resolved.
103730_16_ITEM15_P255_S2	The Company also believes that it has valid claims under its business interruption insurance policies, but those claims cannot be quantified at this time.
103730_16_ITEM15_P255_S3	The Company will not record a receivable for business interruption claims until all contingencies have been resolved.
103730_16_ITEM15_P256_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P257_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P258_S0	Reclassifications of pension and other post-retirement actuarial items out of AOCI are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
103730_16_ITEM15_P258_S1	(See Note 11 for further information).
103730_16_ITEM15_P258_S2	The amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of securities held by the Company's rabbi trust used to fund a deferred compensation plan was $680, $24, and $1,966 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P258_S3	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of compensation expense within Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P259_S0	The pre-tax amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of available-for-sale securities was $0, $54, and $53 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P259_S1	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of Other Income on our consolidated statements of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P259_S2	The tax effect of the reclassifications of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities is recorded as a component of Income Tax Expense on our consolidated statements of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P260_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay's proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_16_ITEM15_P261_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_16_ITEM15_P262_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_16_ITEM15_P262_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_16_ITEM15_P263_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_16_ITEM15_P264_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_16_ITEM15_P265_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_16_ITEM15_P265_S1	These include pension plans which are "qualified" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code, and "non-qualified" pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_16_ITEM15_P266_S0	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P267_S0	The Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee issued new mortality tables and a new mortality improvement scale in 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P267_S1	The new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale are based on a recent study of mortality experience in the United States, and reflect improved retiree longevity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P267_S2	The use of the new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale increased the Company's projected benefit obligations by approximately $24,000 in 2014 and will increase future net periodic pension cost.
103730_16_ITEM15_P267_S3	An updated mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries in 2015 reduced the Company's benefit obligation by approximately $8,000, which mitigates the increased future net periodic pension cost resulting from the new mortality tables.
103730_16_ITEM15_P268_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans historically included both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_16_ITEM15_P268_S1	The Company's principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_16_ITEM15_P268_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P269_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_16_ITEM15_P269_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_16_ITEM15_P269_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company has made additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P269_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_16_ITEM15_P270_S0	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_16_ITEM15_P270_S1	All of the Company's qualified U.S. pension plans have been merged into the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P271_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, the Company executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with its U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P271_S1	These transactions included the purchase of annuity contracts for approximately 700 participants pursuant to an arrangement inherited in a past acquisition and a special limited-time voluntary lump-sum payment offer to certain former employees who were deferred vested participants of the plan not currently receiving periodic payments of their pension benefit.
103730_16_ITEM15_P271_S2	A total of 800 participants accepted the voluntary lump-sum offer.
103730_16_ITEM15_P271_S3	The plan is no longer obligated to pay any benefits to the 1,500 participants covered by these two settlement transactions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P271_S4	These former participants represented approximately 23% of the total participants prior to executing these transactions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P272_S0	These transactions were funded entirely with plan assets and resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15,588, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_16_ITEM15_P272_S1	These non-cash charges are presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P273_S0	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company began the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P273_S1	Plan participants will not be adversely affected by the plan termination, but rather will have their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier.
103730_16_ITEM15_P274_S0	The completion of this proposed termination and settlement is contingent upon the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and meeting certain IRS and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ("PBGC") requirements, which is expected to take at least one year.
103730_16_ITEM15_P275_S0	As of the last fiscal year-end measurement date (December 31, 2015), the Vishay Retirement Plan was fully-funded on a GAAP basis.
103730_16_ITEM15_P275_S1	In order to terminate the plan in accordance with IRS and PBGC requirements, the Company is required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary to do so.
103730_16_ITEM15_P275_S2	The amount necessary to do so is not yet known, but is currently estimated to be between zero and $35,000.
103730_16_ITEM15_P276_S0	The Company's principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_16_ITEM15_P276_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_16_ITEM15_P277_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_16_ITEM15_P277_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P277_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_16_ITEM15_P277_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P277_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $21,137 and $21,757 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P278_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_16_ITEM15_P278_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_16_ITEM15_P278_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P278_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_16_ITEM15_P279_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_16_ITEM15_P279_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_16_ITEM15_P280_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_16_ITEM15_P280_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_16_ITEM15_P280_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P280_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_16_ITEM15_P280_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P280_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $2,995 and $3,607 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P281_S0	In 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul's and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman's employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_16_ITEM15_P281_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_16_ITEM15_P281_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_16_ITEM15_P282_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_16_ITEM15_P282_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P283_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:
103730_16_ITEM15_P284_S0	The plan assets are stated at fair value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P284_S1	See Note 18 for further discussion of the valuation of the plan assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P285_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P286_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P287_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the projected and accumulated benefit obligations:
103730_16_ITEM15_P288_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost:
103730_16_ITEM15_P289_S0	See Note 10 for the pretax, tax effect and after tax amounts included in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P289_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2016 is $11,500.
103730_16_ITEM15_P290_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_16_ITEM15_P291_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:
103730_16_ITEM15_P292_S0	The plans' expected return on assets is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_16_ITEM15_P292_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P293_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plan was remeasured during 2014 concurrent with the two partial settlement transactions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P294_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities and is adjusted for the expected duration of the obligation and the funded status of the plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P294_S1	Given the pending termination and settlement, the Company's U.S. defined benefit plans are currently invested in diversified portfolios of fixed income securities and cash.
103730_16_ITEM15_P294_S2	Investment allocations are made across a range of securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_16_ITEM15_P295_S0	Based on market interest rate conditions and the current market value of the plan assets at December 31, 2015, the qualified defined benefit plan in the U.S. is fully-funded.
103730_16_ITEM15_P295_S1	The Company's non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P295_S2	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_16_ITEM15_P295_S3	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P295_S4	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P295_S5	See Note 18 for further information on the fair value of the plan assets by asset category.
103730_16_ITEM15_P296_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P297_S0	These estimates do not reflect the planned settlement of the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P298_S0	The Company anticipates making contributions to U.S. defined benefit pension plans of between zero and $35,000 in 2016.
103730_16_ITEM15_P299_S0	The Company's anticipated 2016 contributions for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans will approximate $30,000, which includes contributions of $16,000 to the Company's Taiwanese pension plans to improve the funded status of those plans.
103730_16_ITEM15_P300_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains unfunded non-pension postretirement plans, including medical benefits for certain executives and their surviving spouses, which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_16_ITEM15_P300_S1	One of these plans was amended effective January 1, 2012, which reduced the benefit obligations of the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P300_S2	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P301_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and accrued benefit cost related to U.S. and non-U.S. non-pension defined benefit postretirement plans:
103730_16_ITEM15_P302_S0	Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P303_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_16_ITEM15_P304_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost:
103730_16_ITEM15_P305_S0	The estimated actuarial items for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2015 are not material and approximate the amounts amortized in 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P306_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_16_ITEM15_P307_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:
103730_16_ITEM15_P308_S0	The impact of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation is not material.
103730_16_ITEM15_P309_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_16_ITEM15_P310_S0	As the plans are unfunded, the Company's anticipated contributions for 2016 are equal to its estimated benefits payments.
103730_16_ITEM15_P311_S0	The Company participates in various other defined contribution and government-mandated retirement plans based on local law or custom.
103730_16_ITEM15_P311_S1	The Company periodically makes required contributions for certain of these plans, whereas other plans are unfunded retirement bonus plans which will be paid at the employee's retirement date.
103730_16_ITEM15_P311_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the consolidated balance sheets include $13,559 and $13,557, respectively, within accrued pension and other postretirement costs related to these plans.
103730_16_ITEM15_P312_S0	Many of the Company's U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, some of which provide for Company matching under various formulas.
103730_16_ITEM15_P312_S1	The Company's matching expense for the plans was $5,369, $5,285, and $5,276 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P312_S2	No material amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 related to unfunded 401(k) contributions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S0	Certain key employees participate in a deferred compensation plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, these employees could defer a portion of their compensation until retirement, or elect shorter deferral periods.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S2	The Company maintains a liability within other noncurrent liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets related to these deferrals.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S3	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund payments under this plan.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S4	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S5	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P313_S6	Assets held in trust related to the deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $15,717 and $14,906, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P314_S0	The Company has various stockholder-approved programs which allow for the grant of share-based compensation to officers, employees, and non-employee directors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P315_S0	The amount of compensation cost related to stock-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
103730_16_ITEM15_P315_S1	The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
103730_16_ITEM15_P316_S0	The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs"), phantom stock units, and restricted stock based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock adjusted for expected dividends paid over the required vesting period for non-participating awards.
103730_16_ITEM15_P316_S1	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.
103730_16_ITEM15_P317_S0	The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense recognized:
103730_16_ITEM15_P318_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for RSUs that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P318_S1	Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2013, as presented in the table above, includes the material reversal of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest on January 1, 2014 recorded in the second fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P318_S2	$1,778 of these reversed costs had been originally reported as a separate line item upon cessation of employment of certain former executives in 2011, and accordingly, this adjustment is also reported as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P319_S0	A portion of the stock-based compensation expense related to certain current executives that was reversed in the second fiscal quarter of 2013 was recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 due to certain amendments to the performance-based RSUs granted to certain current executives in 2011 approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Director's in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P319_S1	Pursuant to their original terms, the performance-based RSUs would have vested on January 1, 2014 only if all of the associated performance criteria were met for the three-year period ending December 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P319_S2	Pursuant to the amended terms, 75% of the performance-based RSUs of each of the certain current executives vested effective December 5, 2013 in light of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Director's assessment that the performance criteria would be achieved in substantial part by December 31, 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P320_S0	The following table summarizes unrecognized compensation cost and the weighted average remaining amortization periods at December 31, 2015 (amortization periods in years) :
103730_16_ITEM15_P321_S0	Unrecognized compensation cost presented in the table above includes $2,935 of unrecognized compensation cost for performance-based RSUs that are not currently expected to vest and for which no compensation cost is currently being recognized.
103730_16_ITEM15_P322_S0	The Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Program (the "2007 Program"), as amended and restated, was approved by Vishay's stockholders at Vishay's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 20, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P322_S1	The 2007 Program permits the grant of up to 6,500,000 shares of restricted stock, unrestricted stock, RSUs, stock options, and phantom stock units, to officers, employees, and non-employee directors of the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P322_S2	Such instruments are available for grant until May 20, 2024.
103730_16_ITEM15_P323_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company has reserved 3,617,000 shares of common stock for future grants of equity awards pursuant to the 2007 Program.
103730_16_ITEM15_P323_S1	If any outstanding awards are forfeited by the holder or cancelled by the Company, the underlying shares would be available for regrant to others.
103730_16_ITEM15_P324_S0	Each RSU entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock when the RSU vests.
103730_16_ITEM15_P325_S0	RSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is presented below (number of RSUs in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM15_P326_S0	The number of RSUs vested includes shares that the Company withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P327_S0	The number of performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest increases ratably based on the achievement of defined performance criteria between the established target and maximum levels.
103730_16_ITEM15_P327_S1	RSUs with performance-based vesting criteria are expected to vest as follows (number of RSUs in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM15_P328_S0	The performance vesting criteria for the performance-based RSUs with a vesting date of January 1, 2016 were not achieved.
103730_16_ITEM15_P329_S0	In the event of (i) the termination of the executive's employment by the Company without cause, by the executive for "good reason," or as a result of death or disability, the executive's outstanding RSUs shall immediately vest and the outstanding performance-based RSUs shall vest on their normal vesting date to the extent applicable performance criteria are realized; and (ii) a change of control of Vishay, all of such executive's outstanding RSUs and performance-based RSUs shall immediately vest.
103730_16_ITEM15_P329_S1	In the event of voluntary termination by the executive (without "good reason") or termination for cause, the executive's outstanding RSUs and performance-based RSUs will be forfeited.
103730_16_ITEM15_P330_S0	The 2007 Program authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to the extent provided for in the Company's employment agreements with certain executives.
103730_16_ITEM15_P330_S1	Each phantom stock unit entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock at the individual's termination of employment or any other future date specified in the applicable employment agreement.
103730_16_ITEM15_P330_S2	Phantom stock units participate in dividend distribution on the same basis as the Company's common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P330_S3	Dividend equivalents are issued in the form of additional units of phantom stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P330_S4	The phantom stock units are fully vested at all times.
103730_16_ITEM15_P331_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's phantom stock units activity for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (number of phantom stock units in thousands) :

103730_16_ITEM15_P333_S0	Under the 1998 Stock Option Program, certain executive officers and key employees were granted options.
103730_16_ITEM15_P333_S1	On March 16, 2008, the stockholder approval for the 1998 Stock Option Program expired.
103730_16_ITEM15_P333_S2	While no additional options may be granted pursuant to this plan, at December 31, 2015, 95,000 options issued under the 1998 Program remain outstanding and may be exercised in future periods.

103730_16_ITEM15_P336_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of all exercisable options is 1.33 years.
103730_16_ITEM15_P337_S0	The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
103730_16_ITEM15_P337_S1	There were no options granted in 2015, 2014, or 2013.
103730_16_ITEM15_P338_S0	The pretax aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the closing stock price on the last trading day of 2015 of $12.05 per share and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2015 was zero because all outstanding options have exercise prices in excess of market value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P338_S1	This amount changes based on changes in the market value of the Company's common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P338_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014, 4,337 options were exercised.

103730_16_ITEM15_P342_S1	The Company's manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P343_S0	Complying with current laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.
103730_16_ITEM15_P344_S0	The Company has engaged environmental consultants and attorneys to assist management in evaluating potential liabilities related to environmental matters.
103730_16_ITEM15_P344_S1	Management assesses the input from these consultants along with other information known to the Company in its effort to continually monitor these potential liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM15_P344_S2	Such assessments include the Company's share of remediation costs, information known to the Company concerning the size of the hazardous waste sites, their years of operation, and the number of past users and their financial viability.
103730_16_ITEM15_P345_S0	The Company has accrued environmental liabilities of $9,669 as of December 31, 2015 relating to environmental matters related to its General Semiconductor subsidiary.

103730_16_ITEM15_P345_S2	The liabilities recorded for these matters total $16,934, of which $8,459 is included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, and $8,475 is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_16_ITEM15_P346_S0	While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined, management does not believe that the final disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows beyond the amounts previously provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P347_S0	The Company's present and past facilities have been in operation for many years.
103730_16_ITEM15_P347_S1	These facilities have used substances and have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous.
103730_16_ITEM15_P347_S2	Therefore, it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future, which the Company cannot now predict.
103730_16_ITEM15_P348_S0	The Company is a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.
103730_16_ITEM15_P348_S1	The Company is of the opinion that these litigations or claims will not have a material negative effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
103730_16_ITEM15_P349_S0	The Company's Siliconix subsidiary maintains long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P350_S0	Since 2004, Siliconix has maintained a definitive long-term foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with Tower Semiconductor, pursuant to which Siliconix transferred certain technology to Tower Semiconductor and committed to purchase a minimum amount of semiconductor wafers.
103730_16_ITEM15_P350_S1	The Company typically has minimum purchase commitments of $30,000 to $40,000 per year pursuant to its long-term foundry agreements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P350_S2	At December 31, 2015, the extent of those commitments is under discussion with Tower Semiconductor, following the transfer of certain manufacturing processes among Tower Semiconductor's facilities.
103730_16_ITEM15_P351_S0	The Company is a party to various product quality claims in the normal course of business.
103730_16_ITEM15_P351_S1	The Company provides warranties for its products which offer replacement of defective products.
103730_16_ITEM15_P351_S2	Annual warranty expenses are generally not significant.
103730_16_ITEM15_P352_S0	The Company periodically receives claims which arise from consequential damages which result from a customer's installation of an alleged defective Vishay component into the customer's product.
103730_16_ITEM15_P352_S1	Although not covered by its stated warranty, Vishay may occasionally reimburse the customer for these consequential damages in limited circumstances.
103730_16_ITEM15_P353_S0	The Company has employment agreements with certain of its senior executives.
103730_16_ITEM15_P353_S1	These employment agreements provide incremental compensation in the event of termination.

103730_16_ITEM15_P354_S0	The Company recognized executive compensation charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 for elements of compensation that accelerated upon the passing of Dr. Feliz Zandman and for elements of compensation payable to the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, in connection with his resignation.
103730_16_ITEM15_P355_S0	The Company recognized a credit of $1,778 reported as the executive compensation credit in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 for the reversal of stock-based compensation expense previously recorded for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest to Dr. Zandman's estate and the Company's former Chief Financial Officer on January 1, 2014 at the time it was determined that achievement of the performance-based vesting criteria was no longer probable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P356_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues, a material portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, automotive, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P356_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_16_ITEM15_P356_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company's products, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
103730_16_ITEM15_P357_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues, certain subsidiaries and product lines have customers which comprise greater than 10% of the subsidiary's or product line's net revenues.
103730_16_ITEM15_P357_S1	The loss of one of these customers could have a material effect on the results of operations of the subsidiary or product line and financial position of the subsidiary, which could result in an impairment charge which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P358_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P358_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_16_ITEM15_P358_S2	As of December 31, 2015, one customer comprised 14.6% of the Company's accounts receivable balance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P358_S3	This customer comprised 14.7% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P358_S4	No other customer comprised greater than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P359_S0	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_16_ITEM15_P359_S1	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P360_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P360_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_16_ITEM15_P360_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_16_ITEM15_P361_S0	Many of the Company's products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_16_ITEM15_P361_S1	The Company's consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_16_ITEM15_P361_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company's customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_16_ITEM15_P361_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net earnings.
103730_16_ITEM15_P362_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum.
103730_16_ITEM15_P363_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P363_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_16_ITEM15_P364_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P364_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company's ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P364_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company's ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company's products.
103730_16_ITEM15_P365_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_16_ITEM15_P365_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company's policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_16_ITEM15_P365_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_16_ITEM15_P366_S0	Recently enacted rules in the U.S. on conflict minerals, which include tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold, all of which are used in the Company's products, could result in increased prices and decreased supply of conflict minerals, which could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P367_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 74% of revenues earned during 2015 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_16_ITEM15_P367_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, $1,080,858 of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_16_ITEM15_P368_S0	Some of the Company's products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_16_ITEM15_P368_S1	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_16_ITEM15_P368_S2	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_16_ITEM15_P369_S0	As of December 31, 2015 the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_16_ITEM15_P370_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 45 years.
103730_16_ITEM15_P370_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_16_ITEM15_P371_S0	Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_16_ITEM15_P372_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ("segment operating income").
103730_16_ITEM15_P372_S1	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_16_ITEM15_P372_S2	The Company's calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and other items.
103730_16_ITEM15_P372_S3	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_16_ITEM15_P372_S4	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_16_ITEM15_P373_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_16_ITEM15_P374_S0	The Company has also disclosed certain additional items not used to evaluate segment performance.
103730_16_ITEM15_P374_S1	In some cases, the items are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and are required to be disclosed by GAAP.
103730_16_ITEM15_P374_S2	Additionally, the additional segment disclosures may provide insight to the Company's future profitability by reportable segment.
103730_16_ITEM15_P375_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_16_ITEM15_P376_S0	*Recast due to retrospective adoption of accounting guidance.

103730_16_ITEM15_P378_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_16_ITEM15_P379_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_16_ITEM15_P380_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_16_ITEM15_P380_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_16_ITEM15_P381_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM15_P382_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_16_ITEM15_P383_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_16_ITEM15_P384_S0	The Company's convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_16_ITEM15_P384_S1	None of the conversion criteria were met for the periods presented.
103730_16_ITEM15_P384_S2	In periods that the debentures are not convertible, the certain conditions which could trigger conversion of the remaining debentures have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_16_ITEM15_P385_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_16_ITEM15_P385_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the "treasury stock method" (similar to options and warrants) rather than the "if converted method" otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_16_ITEM15_P385_S2	Under the "treasury stock method," Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the debentures based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_16_ITEM15_P385_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.39, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $18.34, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $11.38, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2042.
103730_16_ITEM15_P386_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_16_ITEM15_P387_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P387_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_16_ITEM15_P387_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_16_ITEM15_P388_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_16_ITEM15_P389_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_16_ITEM15_P389_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_16_ITEM15_P390_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions.
103730_16_ITEM15_P391_S0	An asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_16_ITEM15_P392_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:
103730_16_ITEM15_P393_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-20, and as described in Note 3, the Company performed a nonrecurring fair value measurement of its Capacitors segment goodwill balance as of the last day of its third fiscal quarter, October 3, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P393_S1	As a result of the fair value measurement, the goodwill of the Capacitors segment with a carrying value of was $5,380 was written down to its implied value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $5,380, recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P394_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, and as described in Note 3, the Company performed a nonrecurring fair value measurement of its Capella business long-lived assets as of the last day of its third fiscal quarter, October 3, 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P394_S1	As a result of the fair value measurement, the long-lived assets of its Capella business with carrying values of $68,500, were written down to their fair values of $10,900, resulting in a total impairment charge of $57,600, recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P395_S0	The Company's nonrecurring fair value measurements of goodwill and long-lived assets held and used are considered Level 3 measurements.

103730_16_ITEM15_P399_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_16_ITEM15_P400_S0	The short-term investment fund strictly invests in short-term investments, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, U.S. government obligations, corporate notes, and funding agreements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P400_S1	The maturity date of all investments held by the short-term investment fund is within one year from the financial statement date.

103730_16_ITEM15_P406_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_16_ITEM15_P407_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_16_ITEM15_P407_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company's current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures' credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_16_ITEM15_P407_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management's judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P408_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

103730_16_ITEM15_P409_S2	The forward contracts settle monthly and are expected to be renewed at the Company's discretion on a monthly basis until the intercompany loans are repaid.
103730_16_ITEM15_P409_S3	The forward contracts were renewed on the last days of the respective years.
103730_16_ITEM15_P409_S4	We have not designated the forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and as such the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_16_ITEM15_P409_S5	The Company estimates the fair value of the forward contracts based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using current market information and is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierachy.
103730_16_ITEM15_P409_S6	Due to the timing of the renewal of the forward contracts, the value of the forward contracts were immaterial as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
103730_16_ITEM15_P410_S0	The Company does not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_16_ITEM15_P411_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability and capitalized deferred financing costs, at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is approximately $756,900 and $853,500, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability and capitalized deferred financing costs, of $448,080 and $453,817, respectively.
103730_16_ITEM15_P411_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P412_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
103730_16_ITEM15_P412_S1	The short-term investments acquired in the Capella acquisition fully matured in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_16_ITEM15_P412_S2	The assets were accounted for as available for sale instruments, at fair value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P412_S3	The Company's remaining short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
103730_16_ITEM15_P412_S4	The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P413_S0	At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary.
103730_16_ITEM15_P413_S1	No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented.
103730_16_ITEM15_P413_S2	There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification.
103730_16_ITEM15_P413_S3	All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities' maturity dates.
103730_16_ITEM15_P414_S0	Interest on the securities is recognized as interest income when earned.
103730_16_ITEM15_P415_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were comprised of demand deposits, time deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased, and money market funds.
103730_16_ITEM15_P415_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs.
103730_16_ITEM15_P415_S2	Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_16_ITEM15_P416_S0	The Company's financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.
103730_16_ITEM15_P416_S1	The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values.
103730_16_ITEM15_P417_S0	On July 6, 2010, Vishay completed the spin-off of its measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. through a tax-free stock dividend to Vishay's stockholders.
103730_16_ITEM15_P417_S1	Vishay's common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and Vishay's Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.
103730_16_ITEM15_P418_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_16_ITEM15_P419_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG and Vishay operate separately, each as independent public companies.
103730_16_ITEM15_P419_S1	Vishay has no ownership interest in VPG.
103730_16_ITEM15_P419_S2	However, Ruta Zandman solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman and Ziv Shoshani, all of whom are members of Vishay's Board of Directors, control a large portion of the voting power of both Vishay and VPG.

103730_16_ITEM15_P420_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_16_ITEM15_P420_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_16_ITEM15_P420_S2	None of the agreements have had nor are expected to have a material impact on Vishay's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_16_ITEM15_P420_S3	Some of these agreements have expired and have not been renewed.
103730_16_ITEM15_P421_S0	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term "Vishay" in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay's product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_16_ITEM15_P421_S1	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_16_ITEM15_P422_S0	Until the spin-off, VPG was included in Vishay's consolidated federal income tax returns and with Vishay and/or certain of Vishay's subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.
103730_16_ITEM15_P422_S1	In conjunction with the spin-off, Vishay and VPG entered a tax matters agreement under which Vishay generally will be liable for all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes attributable to VPG with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the distribution date except to the extent that VPG has a liability for such taxes on its books at the time of the spin-off.
103730_16_ITEM15_P422_S2	Vishay is also principally responsible for managing any income tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions for pre-spin-off periods.
103730_16_ITEM15_P422_S3	Vishay has fully indemnified VPG of tax exposures arising prior to the spin-off.

103730_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our components are used in virtually every type of product that contains electronic circuitry, in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer, telecommunications, power supplies, military, aerospace, and medical markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	In the 1950's, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with a loan from the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	These products were included with the measurements and foil resistor businesses that we spun off into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("Vishay Precision Group" or "VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders on July 6, 2010.
103730_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	In the early 1990's, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay's global market position in passive components.
103730_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_17_ITEM1_P4_S4	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011; HiRel Systems in 2012; MCB Industrie in 2013; and Holy Stone Polytech in 2014.
103730_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	In the late 1990's, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Vishay's next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay's acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P7_S4	In 2014, Vishay increased its position in optoelectronic sensors through its acquisition of Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic components.
103730_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	We continue to implement the vision, strategy, and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman as we continue to work tirelessly to enhance value for our stockholders.
103730_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Vishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2143.
103730_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our telephone number is (610) 644-1300.
103730_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We were founded based on the inventions of Dr. Felix Zandman and we continue to emphasize technological innovation as a driver of growth.
103730_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	We are currently a worldwide technology and market leader in wirewound and other power resistors, leaded film resistors, thin film SMD resistors, wet and conformal-coated tantalum capacitors, capacitors for power electronics, power rectifiers, low-voltage power MOSFETs, and infrared components.
103730_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We maintain strategically placed application and product support centers where proximity to customers and our manufacturing locations enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	The breadth of our product portfolio along with the proximity of our field application engineers to customers provides increased opportunities to have our components selected and designed into new end products by customers in all relevant market segments.
103730_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through accelerating the development of new products and technologies and increasing design-in opportunities by expanding our technical resources for providing solutions to customers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We are a leading manufacturer in our industry, with a broad product portfolio, access to a wide range of end markets and sales channels, and geographic diversity.

103730_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	Over the past two decades, our management team has successfully restructured our company and integrated several acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	We can adapt our operations to changing economic conditions, as demonstrated by our ability to remain profitable and generate cash through the volatile economic cycle of the recent past.
103730_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We have one of the broadest product lines of discrete semiconductors and passive components among our competitors.
103730_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our broad product portfolio allows us to penetrate markets in all industry segments and all regions, which reduces our exposure to a particular end market or geographic location.
103730_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through improving market penetration by expanding manufacturing facilities for our most successful products, increasing technical resources, and developing markets for specialty products in Asia.
103730_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our net revenues for the following applicable periods were attributable to customers in the following regions:
103730_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	The share of net revenues by end market was as follows:
103730_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Since 1985, we have expanded our product line through various strategic acquisitions, growing from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.
103730_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have successfully integrated the acquired companies within our existing management and operational structure, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales and administrative functions, creating manufacturing synergies, while improving customer service.
103730_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	We have often targeted high margin niche business acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	We also target strategic acquisitions of businesses with technology and engineering capabilities that we can use to grow our business.
103730_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as "free cash" (see "Overview" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for "free cash" definition and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")).
103730_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 20 years and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 15 years.
103730_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures (see "Cost Management" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") to contribute to our "free cash" generation going forward.
103730_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2016, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $741.4 million.
103730_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $640 million through December 10, 2020, of which $490.1 million was available as of December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong "free cash" flow generation provide financial strength and flexibility and reduce our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by fluctuating consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, modify existing products, respond to technological change, and customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have licenses to use, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
103730_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	We plan to continue to use our research and development ("R D"), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	As part of our plan to foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our worldwide R D and engineering technical staff, and increased our technical field sales force in Asia to increase opportunities to design-in our products in local markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our success.
103730_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop new innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products to make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends.
103730_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We are directing increased funding and are focusing on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	We focus on controlling fixed costs and reducing variable costs.
103730_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	When our ongoing cost management activites are not adequate, we take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness including restructuring our business to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	We plan to continue to expand within the electronic components industry, through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product innovation, quality, and reliability, strong customer bases, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.

103730_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Passive components are used to store electrical charges, to limit or resist electrical current, and to help in filtering, surge suppression, measurement, timing, and tuning applications.
103730_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Resistors and inductors both impede electric current.
103730_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current.
103730_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Inductors use an internal magnetic field to change alternating current phase and resist alternating current.
103730_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our Resistors and Inductors business is our original business.
103730_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	We maintain the broadest portfolio of resistor products worldwide.
103730_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	Under current market conditions, the business is solid, predictable, and growing at relatively stable selling prices.

103730_17_ITEM1_P50_S6	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Resistors vary widely in precision and cost, and are manufactured from numerous materials and in many forms.
103730_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	Linear resistive components are classified as variable or fixed, depending on whether or not their resistance is adjustable.
103730_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Non-linear resistors function by varying in resistance under influence of temperature (thermistors) or voltage (varistors).
103730_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	They can be used in temperature-measuring applications or as current or voltage-limiting devices.
103730_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We manufacture virtually all types of fixed resistors, both in discrete and network forms, as well as many variable types.
103730_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Vishay resistor innovations include Power Metal Strip technology.
103730_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	These resistors feature very low resistance and are used to measure changes in current flow (current sensing) or divert current flow (shunting).
103730_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Inductor applications include controlling AC current and voltage, filtering out unwanted electrical signals, and energy storage.
103730_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Vishay inductor innovations include IHLP low-profile, high-current inductor technology with industry-leading specifications, which is patented and generates royalty revenue.
103730_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our low-profile, high-current inductors save circuit board space and power in voltage regulator module ("VRM") and DC to DC converter applications.
103730_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	In addition, we are a worldwide leader in custom magnetic solutions focusing on high performance and high reliability.
103730_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	This field has been substantially strengthened, with the 2012 acquisition of HiRel Systems, broadening our portfolio, customer, and market segment reach.
103730_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Capacitors store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our Capacitors business consists of a broad range of reliable, high-quality products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	We have a strong presence worldwide in specialty markets based on our product performance and reliability and strong brand recognition (including our Sprague, Vitramon, Roederstein, BCcomponents, and ESTA brands).
103730_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Capacitors are used in almost all electronic circuits.
103730_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	They store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Important applications for capacitors include electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies; decoupling and bypass of electronic signals for integrated circuits and circuit boards; and frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applications.
103730_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	We manufacture products based on all major capacitor technologies: tantalum (molded chip tantalum, coated chip tantalum, solid through-hole tantalum, wet tantalum, and polymer), ceramic (multilayer chip and ceramic disc), film, power, heavy-current, and aluminum electrolytic.
103730_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our capacitors range from tiny surface-mount devices for hearing aids and mobile devices to large power correction capacitors used in renewable energy, heavy industry, and electrical power grids.
103730_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	We are a recognized technology leader in many product ranges, securing our strong position in military and medical markets, and in a wide range of industrial and automotive applications.
103730_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	Our wet tantalum and MicroTan technologies are market leaders.
103730_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by United States government agencies, and under certain European military specifications.
103730_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_17_ITEM1_P61_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product's classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed "dies" or "chips") on each wafer.
103730_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed "packages") that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_17_ITEM1_P65_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_17_ITEM1_P66_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel.
103730_17_ITEM1_P66_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Dominican Republic, Japan, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_17_ITEM1_P66_S5	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	All of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification.
103730_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Certain materials, in addition to tantalum and including tin, tungsten, and gold are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers, the source for which may be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country.
103730_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	We are working toward the elimination of materials that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries from our supply chain.
103730_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_17_ITEM1_P79_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_17_ITEM1_P79_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2016 is shown below:
103730_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers' specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_17_ITEM1_P81_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_17_ITEM1_P82_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer's business requirements.
103730_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ("FAEs") to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers' engineering needs.
103730_17_ITEM1_P84_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_17_ITEM1_P84_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay "design-in" the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_17_ITEM1_P84_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_17_ITEM1_P84_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P85_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_17_ITEM1_P85_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People's Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	We also employ research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
103730_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our primary competitors by product type include:
103730_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	MOSFETs: Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Rohm, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba.
103730_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	Diodes: Diodes, Inc., Infineon, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics.
103730_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	Optoelectronic Components: Avago, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors, Rohm, Sharp, Toshiba.
103730_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	Resistors and Inductors: KOA, Murata, Panasonic, Rohm, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	Capacitors: AVX, KEMET, Murata, Nichicon, Panasonic, TDK-EPCOS, Yageo.
103730_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	There are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete.
103730_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	Our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability, technological innovation, business reputation, and price competitiveness.
103730_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	Recently there has been a considerable amount of consolidation acitivity in the electronic component industry, some of which involved our primary competitors.
103730_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	We view the industry consolidation as an opportunity for us to gain business as an independent second-source supplier.
103730_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity's or individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 22,100 full time employees, of whom approximately 91% were located outside the United States.
103730_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_17_ITEM1_P104_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_17_ITEM1_P106_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_17_ITEM1_P110_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_17_ITEM1_P110_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_17_ITEM1_P110_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_17_ITEM1_P110_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_17_ITEM1_P111_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_17_ITEM1_P111_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_17_ITEM1_P111_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_17_ITEM1_P112_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_17_ITEM1_P112_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_17_ITEM1_P112_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_17_ITEM1_P112_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_17_ITEM1_P113_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_17_ITEM1_P113_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and future periods of decline and recovery are not predictable.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Market conditions, such as a decline in product demand on a global basis, could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred and will continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to achieve synergies, eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions, and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In 2013 and 2015, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The programs primarily focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses company-wide, and improving the performance of certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In 2016, we announced an extension of the 2013 MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We incur accelerated depreciation expenses related to assets that will no longer be used after the associated restructuring programs are implemented.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The expenses associated with the programs have been and will continue to be recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Complete implementation of all of the programs is expected to occur before the end of 2017.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are subject to various U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations that may affect our ability to complete certain acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, or we cannot effectively mitigate the assumed, contingent, and unknown liabilities acquired, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Certain acquisitions will increase the risks inherent in our business.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our 2014 acquisition of Capella Microsystems (Taiwan) Inc. is unique compared to our past acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Most of our previous acquisitions were established businesses with substantial tangible assets.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a fabless design business, most of the assets acquired in the Capella transaction were intangible.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Capella business has not performed as expected.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, it was determined in 2015 that the depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets of Capella were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges of $57.6 million in 2015 to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If the acquired business continues to not perform as expected, we may be required to record further impairment charges related to those intangible assets, with limited ability to monetize any of those assets.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are significant risks specific to the acquired business that could result in it continuing to not perform as expected.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a fabless design business, Capella is substantially dependent on independent third-party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture its products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If Capella cannot obtain sufficient capacity commitments, if Capella's foundries and subcontractors suffer financial instability, liquidity issues, or insolvency proceedings affecting their ability to manufacture our products, or if Capella's foundries and subcontractors experience production delays for other reasons, the supply of its products could be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If demand for its products increases significantly, we have no assurances that Capella's third-party foundries and subcontractors will be able to increase their manufacturing capacity to a level that meets our requirements, potentially preventing us from meeting our customer demand and harming our business and customer relationships.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, even if Capella's foundries and subcontractors are able to meet our increased demand, those third-party manufacturers may decide to charge significantly higher wafer prices to us, which could reduce our gross margin or require us to offset the increased costs by increasing prices to our customers, either of which could harm our business and operating results.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Capella's future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We could be materially adversely affected if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increases significantly or we are unsuccessful in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified personnel.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Should we lose one or more engineers who are key to a project's completion during the course of a particular project, the completion of such project may be delayed which could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Capella's historical customer base is concentrated among a few key customers, and is focused on end-users in the consumer products industry.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The delay, significant reduction in, or loss of, orders from these large customers or the consumer products industry, or demands of price concessions from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations, or could result in significant volatility in our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our credit facility bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $357 million as of December 31, 2016, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Additionally, our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P35_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we experienced during the recent period of economic slowdown.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately reflects the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 76% of our revenues during 2016 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 46 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	We do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P66_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Approximately 99% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As of December 31, 2016, $1,084.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by subsidiaries outside of the United States.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Except as described in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P69_S5	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	At December 31, 2016, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 47.5% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P71_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.5% of our Class B common stock and 42.6% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Along with the voting power of the Class B common stock, our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Some or all of our holders of Class B common stock may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name .
103730_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the "Vishay" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the "Vishay" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2016, our business had 49 manufacturing locations.
103730_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.

103730_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.

103730_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Class B common stock generally is not transferable except in certain very limited instances, and there is no market for those shares.
103730_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Class B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock on a share for share basis.
103730_17_ITEM5_P5_S2	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors) approximately 89.5% of our Class B common stock and 42.6% of the total voting power of our capital stock.
103730_17_ITEM5_P6_S0	Certain of our debt obligations contain restrictions as to the payment of cash dividends.
103730_17_ITEM5_P7_S0	On May 2, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.

103730_17_ITEM5_P7_S2	The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at our direction in accordance with the plan.
103730_17_ITEM5_P7_S3	The following table provides information about repurchases of the Company's common stock during the three-month period ended December 31, 2016:

103730_17_ITEM5_P8_S1	The line graph assumes that $100 had been invested at December 31, 2011 and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
103730_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012.

103730_17_ITEM6_P3_S2	These items, net of their tax consequences, had a negative $0.15 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_17_ITEM6_P3_S3	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM6_P4_S0	Includes the results of MCB Industrie, from June 13, 2013.
103730_17_ITEM6_P4_S1	Also includes a net pretax reversal of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the performance-based RSUs scheduled to vest on January 1, 2014, which were originally reported as a separate line item upon the cessation of employment of certain former executive officers in 2011 of $1,778,000, a $2,867,000 one-time tax benefit due to a new law enacted in Israel in July 2013 which effectively increases the corporate income tax rate on certain types of income earned after January 1, 2014, and, therefore, increases our deferred tax assets, and a $1,330,000 one-time tax benefit due to the retroactive enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that was signed into law on January 2, 2013, partially offset by $2,814,000 of restructuring and severance costs.
103730_17_ITEM6_P4_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.02 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_17_ITEM6_P5_S0	Includes the results of HiRel Systems LLC from January 13, 2012.
103730_17_ITEM6_P5_S1	Also includes net pretax gain on the sale of property in Belgium vacated as a result of restructuring in prior years of $12,153,000 and a $4,036,000 one-time tax benefit related to the release of deferred tax valuation allowances in Israel following a merger of several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Israel which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits.
103730_17_ITEM6_P5_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.08 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_17_ITEM6_P6_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, restructuring and severance costs, material pension settlement charges, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains and losses on sales of property, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.

103730_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	We operate in five product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	In 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase our ability to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	Although we have no current plans, we will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	On May 2, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	The stock repurchase plan will expire on May 2, 2017.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S7	The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at the Company's direction in accordance with the plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S8	The Company repurchased 1,752,454 shares of stock for $23.2 million since the inception of the plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P3_S9	We will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities.
103730_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	As a result of that evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense of $164.0 million, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings which we expect to repatriate to the U.S. over the next several years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	We repatriated $46 million to the U.S. in 2016 pursuant to this plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	We continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	In the first fiscal quarter of 2016, we substantially completed the implementation of targeted cost reduction programs that began in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	The cost reduction programs initiated in 2015 continue as planned.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	As a result of a review of recent financial results and outlook for our MOSFETs segment following the recent completion of production transfers, we determined to implement further cost reductions for the MOSFETs segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	In November 2016, we announced an extension of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S7	Our cost reduction programs are more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and in "Cost Management" below.
103730_17_ITEM7_P6_S8	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1.

103730_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	We own and operate a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	As more fully described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded a loss of $5.4 million related to this incident in 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	The temporary shutdown adversely impacted revenues and margins of our Diodes segment (and total Vishay) for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	We received insurance payments totaling $13.4 million and recognized a gain of $8.8 million related to this incident and the insurance proceeds received in 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	In December 2016, we completed the termination and settlement of our qualified U.S. pension plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The settlement resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $79.3 million to recognize the unrecognized actuarial items related to the pension plan recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
103730_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	The pension plan termination and settlement is more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Net revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter, but increased versus the prior year quarter.
103730_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	Net revenues for 2016 increased versus 2015 and operating results improved.
103730_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Continued strong orders resulted in an increase in many key financial metrics compared to the prior quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.323 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.300 billion and $2.493 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $48.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders of $108.5 million, or $0.73 per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, and net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $117.6 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted for various items that management believes are not indicative of the intrinsic operating performance of our business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	We define free cash as the cash flows generated from continuing operations less capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
103730_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash do not have uniform definitions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net earnings (loss) attributable to Vishay stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 include items affecting comparability.
103730_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	* Includes add-back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive.
103730_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP.
103730_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our results for 2016 represent the effects of a strong business environment, sustained high order volume, our cost reduction programs, and our growth initiatives.
103730_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Our percentage of euro-based sales approximates our percentage of euro-based expenses so the negative foreign currency impact on revenues was substantially offset by the positive impact on expenses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our pre-tax results were consistent with expectations based on our business model.
103730_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our results for 2015 represent the effects of a weaker business environment in several of our customer end markets versus 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	Our revenue results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were negatively affected by foreign currency effects, especially from the euro, and the temporary shutdown of our diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China.
103730_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	We also monitor changes in our inventory turnover and our or publicly available average selling prices ("ASP").
103730_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Using our and publicly available data, we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	All pricing is subject to governing market conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	(1) Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 and the first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2016 includes $9.8 million, $6.5 million, $4.5 million, $1.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively, of restructuring and severance expenses (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 includes $79.3 million of pension settlement charges (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	Operating margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2016 includes $1.6 million of intangible asset impairment charges (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	See "Financial Metrics by Segment" below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 decreased versus the third fiscal quarter of 2016, partially due to currency effects.
103730_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Order levels recovered in 2016 and sustained a high level throughout the year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	The continued strong order level increased the backlog and book-to-bill ratio.
103730_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our average selling prices continue to decline primarily due to our commodity semiconductor products and the effects of growing our Resistors Inductors business in Asia.
103730_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Gross profit margin decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter, but increased versus the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The fluctuations are primarily volume-driven with decreasing average selling prices burdening each period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Gross profit margins for the periods prior to the second fiscal quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by additional depreciation associated with our MOSFETs cost reduction program.
103730_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	The book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.11 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 from 1.04 in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 1.16 and 1.04, respectively, versus ratios of 1.10 and 0.98, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our existing product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA").
103730_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay's four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, an average of approximately $100 million of revenues per year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions with a purchase price larger than $500 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we deposited the $6.8 million purchase price of Sonntag Electronic GmbH ("Sonntag").
103730_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The acquisition was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Sonntag is a distributor of electronic components in Germany.
103730_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	We did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	On June 11, 2014, we acquired Holy Stone Polytech Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone Polytech" or "Vishay Polytech Co. Ltd."), a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20.6 million, net of cash acquired.
103730_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We are using the technology acquired to begin to penetrate the polymer tantalum capacitor market.
103730_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations of Holy Stone Polytech have been included in the Capacitors segment since June 11, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	On July 11, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire Capella for approximately NT$6,051 million or $205 million at then-current exchange rates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Capella is a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic sensors that was publicly traded in Taiwan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	As a first step in the acquisition, we launched a tender offer for Capella's outstanding shares.
103730_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella pursuant to the merger agreement on December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	The acquisition has strengthened the in-house design capabilities of our entire optoelectronic components business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Upon the close of the tender offer, we controlled Capella and began consolidating it in our financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations of Capella have been included in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The interest of the shares not tendered are presented as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements for the period from the conclusion of the tender offer until they were acquired on December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Due to the nature of Capella's business, $74.5 million of the purchase price was allocated to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	While we still expect that the addition of Capella will, in the mid- and long-term, add considerable value through the creation of an in-house design capability, the business has not performed as expected in its traditional end-market of smart phones.
103730_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	Accordingly, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 to write-down the acquired Capella assets to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impairment charge.
103730_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs, and use various measures and metrics to evaluate our cost structure.
103730_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	We define variable costs as expenses that vary with respect to quantity produced.
103730_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Fixed costs do not vary with respect to quantity produced over the relevant time period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Contributive margin is calculated as net revenue less variable costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	It may be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of net revenue.
103730_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Management uses this measure to determine the amount of profit to be expected for any change in revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	While these measures are typical cost accounting measures, none of these measures are recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_17_ITEM7_P54_S4	The classification of expenses as either variable or fixed is judgemental and other companies might classify such expenses differently.
103730_17_ITEM7_P54_S5	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	We closely monitor variable costs and seek to achieve the contributive margin in our business model.
103730_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Over a period of many years, we have generally maintained a contributive margin of between 45% - 47% of revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	The erosion of average selling prices, particularly of our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry, and inflation negatively impact contributive margin and drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	Our variable cost reduction efforts include increasing the efficiency in our production facilities by expending capital for automation, reducing materials costs, materials substitution, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs recorded as costs of products sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses and maintaining our break-even point (adjusted for acquisitions).
103730_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	We seek to limit increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses to the rate of inflation, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	At constant fixed costs, we would expect each $1 million increase in revenues to increase our operating income by approximately $450,000 to $470,000.
103730_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	Sudden changes in the business conditions, however, may not allow us to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity and cost structure.
103730_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Occasionally, our ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate and we must take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness.
103730_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	We incurred significant restructuring expenses in our past to reduce our cost structure.
103730_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	Since 2013, our cost reduction programs have primarily focused on reducing fixed costs, including selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	We recorded $9.3 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2016 for the expenses that were recognizable under GAAP during the period and $38.5 million of restructuring and severance expenses since these cost reduction programs were implemented.
103730_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The programs initiated in 2013 primarily focused on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees Company-wide.
103730_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	We also implemented two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	The programs in total were designed to lower costs by approximately $36 million per year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement offer was made to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and/or years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The program was substantially completed in 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The total costs associated with the voluntary separation / early retirement program were approximately $13.4 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	We realized an annual reduction in fixed costs of approximately $10 million, split approximately 35% in manufacturing and 65% in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Two other smaller cost reduction programs relate to the transfer of production of certain products within our Diodes segment, which were initiated in the third fiscal quarter of 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Both programs are connected to production moves, in order to take advantage of lower labor costs in one program and from the consolidation of manufacturing locations in the other.
103730_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	We realized annual cost savings of approximately $3 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	We completed the initally planned production transfer as part of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program in the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The production transfer occurred over a period of approximately two years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	The manufacture of wafers for certain critical products has been transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	As a consequence, certain other wafer manufacturing previously occurring in-house has been transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	We have incurred and may continue to incur other exit costs associated with the production transfer, including certain contract termination costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	The initially-planned production transfer achieved the expected improvement in contributive margin percentage and fixed cost reduction; however, as a result of a decrease in net revenues since the plan was first initiated, gross margin for the MOSFETs segment remains below 20%.
103730_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	As a result of a review of recent financial results and outlook for our MOSFETs segment following the recent completion of production transfers, we determined to implement further cost reductions for the MOSFETs segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	On November 7, 2016, we announced an extension of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	The extended program includes various cost reduction initiatives, primarily the transfer of all remaining manufacturing operations at our Santa Clara, California facility to other Vishay facilities or third-party subcontractors.
103730_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The production transfers will be completed in steps by the end of 2017.
103730_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	We expect to incur cash charges of approximately $4 million to $8 million, primarily related to severance, to implement these steps.
103730_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	We expect to realize savings of approximately $8 million to $9 million as a result of these initiatives.
103730_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	We expect to maintain our R D and management presence in the Silicon Valley area, even after the cessation of manufacturing operations there.
103730_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	The total cash charges for the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program are expected to be $23 million to $27 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Programs were also initiated in 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	The programs initiated in 2015 include a plan to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and targeted streamlining and consolidation of production for certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	The programs in total are expected to lower costs by approximately $35 million annually (at current volumes) when fully implemented, at expected cash costs of approximately $30 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	The implementation of these programs will not impact planned R D activities, or our growth initiatives in Asian markets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P71_S4	We recorded $9.9 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2016 for expenses that were recognizable under GAAP during the period and $23.7 million of restructuring and severance expenses since these programs were initiated.
103730_17_ITEM7_P71_S5	The remaining expenses associated with these programs will be recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	The programs announced in 2015 are expected to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs by approximately $17 million annually.
103730_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	These selling, general, and administrative cost reductions were substantially implemented by the end of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	We first solicited volunteers to accept a voluntary separation / early retirement offer.
103730_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	The voluntary separation benefits varied by country and job classification, but generally offered a cash loyalty bonus.
103730_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	Additional involuntary terminations were necessary to achieve the cost reduction targets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	We began to realize cost savings as a result of these programs in 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The targeted plans to streamline and consolidate production of certain product lines are expected to decrease costs of products sold by approximately $18 million annually (at current volumes).
103730_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	These plans include the Zwolle, Netherlands aluminum capacitors facility closure announced on June 30, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Except for the Zwolle and Santa Clara facilities described above, no other facility closures are currently expected pursuant to these programs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Except for the distinct and targeted programs noted above, we do not anticipate any other material restructuring activities in 2017.
103730_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	We believe that we can substantially maintain our trained workforce, even at lower manufacturing activity levels, by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	However, a sluggish business environment for the electronics industry or the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	We have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to any of the businesses acquired since 2011, but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Even as we seek to manage our costs, we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	We plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	To foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our worldwide R D and engineering technical staff; we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities; we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia to increase our market access to the industrial segment and increase the design-in of our products in local markets; and we are directing increased funding and focus on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	These efforts as well as our broad and innovative product portfolio and strong position in distribution worldwide have us positioned very well in case of a dramatic upturn in the economy.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S4	Our growth plan also targets adding, through acquisitions, $100 million of revenues per year on average.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S5	Since 2011, we have acquired the specialty product businesses of Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, LLC, and MCB Industrie.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S6	In 2014, we made strategic acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech and Capella and plan to use the technology and engineering capabilities acquired to further grow our business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P79_S7	We continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities despite the current economic volatility.
103730_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our goodwill impairment tests.
103730_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.4 million to write-off the goodwill balance of our Capacitors reporting unit as a result of these tests.
103730_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of October 3, 2015, the last day of the third fiscal quarter, was effectively the annual impairment test for 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	No goodwill impairment was identified as a result of the 2016 annual impairment test.
103730_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The recorded impairment charge is non-cash in nature and does not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests.
103730_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	As a result of a review of recent financial results and outlook for the MOSFETs segment following the completion of production transfers, we determined that an interim indefinite-lived impairment test was required for our Siliconix tradenames as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	As a result of this analysis, we determined that our Siliconix tradenames, with a carrying value of $20.4 million, were impaired.
103730_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	We recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million to write-down the tradenames to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	The tradenames are no longer considered indefinite-lived and the remaining value will be amortized over the 10 year estimated remaining useful life.
103730_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, we performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with our Capella business were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges totaling $57.6 million to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We perform our annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The interim impairment tests performed as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the last days of the fiscal third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, were effectively the annual impairment tests for 2016 and 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	The recorded impairment charges are non-cash in nature and do not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	We occasionally use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the "functional currency" of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	A subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company's operations generally would have the parent company's currency as its functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P92_S4	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 had significant impacts on our balance sheet.
103730_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	On a weighted average basis for the full year 2016 versus 2015, the U.S. dollar was relatively unchanged versus relevant foreign currencies, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars having an immaterial impact on reported revenues and expenses versus 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	The U.S. dollar in 2016 and 2015 was significantly stronger versus 2014, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM7_P96_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P96_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been favorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk and forward contracts used to mitigate certain foreign currency risks.
103730_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Recording and monitoring of our sales accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_17_ITEM7_P102_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_17_ITEM7_P102_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent revenue recognition guidance that has not yet been adopted.
103730_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_17_ITEM7_P104_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our goodwill impairment tests.
103730_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units required for a quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, in-process research and development, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment (valued at replacement costs).
103730_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_17_ITEM7_P114_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	As of December 31, 2016, one customer comprised 15.4% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	This customer comprised 14.6% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P115_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	At December 31, 2016, our U.S. plans include various non-qualified plans.
103730_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	As further described below, our U.S. plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") was terminated and settled in 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	The table below summarizes information about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements (amounts in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for certain postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_17_ITEM7_P119_S4	We use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_17_ITEM7_P119_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_17_ITEM7_P120_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_17_ITEM7_P120_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	Non-qualified plans in the U.S. are considered by law to be unfunded.
103730_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	However, the Company maintains assets in a rabbi trust to fund benefit payments under certain of these plans.
103730_17_ITEM7_P121_S2	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	Some non-U.S. plans also informally fund their plans by holding certain available-for-sale investments.
103730_17_ITEM7_P122_S3	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P123_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_17_ITEM7_P123_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits accrued after December 31, 2008.
103730_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	Accordingly, net periodic pension cost for U.S. plans no longer include any service cost.
103730_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, we executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with our U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	These transactions reduced the number of participants the plan is obligated to pay by approximately 1,500 and also resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15.6 million, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, we began the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan, our remaining U.S. qualified pension plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	We completed the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan in December 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	The termination and settlement required no additional cash contributions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P127_S3	Excess plan assets will be transferred to a qualified defined contribution retirement plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	We recognized pre-tax non-cash settlement charges aggregating $79.3 million, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	We continue to seek to de-risk our global pension exposures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	Such actions could result in increased net periodic pension cost due to lower expected rates of return on plan assets and/or possible additional charges to recognize unamortized actuarial items if all or a portion of the obligations were to be settled.
103730_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_17_ITEM7_P130_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	See Note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our income tax policies.
103730_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_17_ITEM7_P132_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	We have generally recognized net deferred tax assets only where there is a recent history of taxable income and forecasts of future taxable income.
103730_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our provision for income taxes is based on various assertions regarding future use of that cash and profits.
103730_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	Such assertions require us to consider a wide variety of U.S. federal and foreign tax laws, and the application of such laws to our operational and strategic needs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	The cash repatriation program described below is expected to occur over several years, and the deferred tax liability is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each respective balance sheet date.
103730_17_ITEM7_P135_S1	Changes in the underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.
103730_17_ITEM7_P135_S2	During 2016, we recognized a $3.6 million tax benefit for periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the cash repatriation program.
103730_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings (including $20 million of 2015 earnings and $280 million of earnings from prior periods).
103730_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	We recognized this tax expense in 2015 following an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	During 2014, the Company recognized income tax expense on foreign earnings in anticipation of a repatriation intended to repay $53 million of borrowings on its revolving credit facility used for the Capella acquisition.
103730_17_ITEM7_P137_S1	The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 included all U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P137_S2	That repatriation was completed in 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	Except as described above, as of December 31, 2016, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes of foreign earnings, which are deemed to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely.
103730_17_ITEM7_P138_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	We and our subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	In 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its examination of our U.S. federal tax returns through the 2011 tax year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P139_S2	The tax returns of principal non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include Germany (2009 through 2012), India (2004 through 2013), Israel (2013 through 2014), and Taiwan (2014).
103730_17_ITEM7_P139_S3	We and our subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	During 2016 and 2014, certain tax examinations were completed and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	Our tax provisions for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 include tax benefits related to the resolution of these matters.
103730_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	Statement of operations' captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	We experienced a broad increase in demand for our products in 2016 compared to 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	Our 2016 and 2015 net revenue results were negatively impacted by foreign currency effects compared to 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_17_ITEM7_P146_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_17_ITEM7_P146_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $86.9 million, $83.1 million, and $89.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.6%, 3.5%, and 3.5%, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P146_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were approximately $85.3 million, $84.0 million, and $87.9 million, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P146_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $0.3 million, $3.3 million, and $4.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	The decrease is due to the expiration of certain licensing agreements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 24.5%, as compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher volume, cost savings from our restructuring programs, and lower metals and materials prices.
103730_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 23.6%, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	The decrease was due primarily to lower volume and lower average selling prices.
103730_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Gross profit margins for the MOSFETs segment were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	The MOSFETs segment experienced another decrease in its revenues in 2016 versus the prior year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	Net revenues were negatively impacted by declining selling prices, with only small offsetting volume increases in 2016 and a volume decrease in 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P154_S2	With the exception of the business with our Asian distributors, we experienced a decrease in net revenues in all other regions and sales channels.
103730_17_ITEM7_P154_S3	The increase in business with Asian distributors is mostly attributable to our Integrated Circuit ("IC") products.
103730_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	The gross profit margin of 2016 has been negatively impacted by the recognition of expenses incurred on inventory produced last year due to the restructuring program that was sold this year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	Despite this negative impact and lower average selling prices, the gross profit percentage of 2016 increased slightly versus prior year due to cost reductions from our restructuring program and foreign currency effects.
103730_17_ITEM7_P155_S2	The gross profit margins for 2015 and 2014 were negatively impacted by additional depreciation associated with the MOSFETs cost reduction program.
103730_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	Typical pricing pressure continues, although slightly accelerating, for our established MOSFETs products.
103730_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	We have experienced significant declines in average selling prices in both 2016 versus 2015 and 2015 versus 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	In 2013, we announced a cost reduction program to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	The planned production transfers were substantially implemented by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016 and began to provide improvement in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	As a result of a review of financial results and outlook for the MOSFETs segment following the recent completion of production transfers, we have determined to implement further cost reductions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	On November 7, 2016, we announced an extension of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_17_ITEM7_P158_S2	The revised program includes various cost reduction initiatives, primarily the transfer of all remaining manufacturing operations at its Santa Clara, California facility to other Vishay facilities or third-party subcontractors.
103730_17_ITEM7_P158_S3	We expect to maintain our R D and management presence in the Silicon Valley area, even after the cessation of manufacturing operations there.
103730_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	The production transfers will be completed in steps by the end of 2017.
103730_17_ITEM7_P159_S1	We expect to incur cash charges of approximately $4 to $8 million, primarily related to severance, to implement these steps, and expect to realize annualized cost savings of approximately $8 to $9 million as a result of these new initiatives.
103730_17_ITEM7_P159_S2	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	We also determined that an interim indefinite-lived impairment test was required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	As a result of that assessment, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million to write-down our Siliconix tradenames to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM7_P160_S2	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	We continue to make capital and R D investments in this business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	Gross profit margins for the Diodes segment were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_17_ITEM7_P165_S1	We own and operate a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_17_ITEM7_P165_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_17_ITEM7_P165_S3	The temporary shutdown adversely impacted 2015 revenues and margins of our Diodes segment (and total Vishay).
103730_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	Diodes net revenues for 2016 increased significantly versus the prior year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	The net revenue increases are primarily due to volume increases versus the prior year, which was impacted by the aforementioned temporary shutdown.
103730_17_ITEM7_P166_S2	The volume increases were partially offset by a moderate decline in average selling prices that is typical for our established Diodes products.
103730_17_ITEM7_P166_S3	The net revenue increases were predominantly in Asia and Europe.
103730_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	The gross profit margin increased versus the prior year primarily due to increases in sales volume, the effects of our cost reduction programs, and positive foreign currency exchange rate impact on the Asian cost-of-sales, which were only partially offset by declining average selling prices and general cost inflation.
103730_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	Gross profit margins for the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues for 2016 decreased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P171_S1	Volume increases, particularly with our European distributors and our American customers, could not fully offset the negative impact of declining average selling prices.
103730_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	The gross profit margin increased slightly versus prior year despite the decrease in revenues.
103730_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	Cost reductions and favorable foreign currency exchange rate effects were partially offset by lower average selling prices and general cost inflation.
103730_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	The pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products increased in 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	We experienced a moderate decline in average selling prices in 2016 versus 2015 and a slight decline in 2015 versus 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	In 2014, we acquired Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic products, in a two step transaction completed on December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	Capella is included in the Optoelectronic Components segment results from the date we obtained control in September 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P174_S2	Although the Capella business has not performed as expected, we still believe that the addition of Capella has strengthened the in-house design capabilities of our entire Optoelectronic Components business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	In 2015, we recorded long-lived depreciable and amortizable asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	Gross profit margins for the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment increased significantly in 2016 versus the prior year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	All regions contributed to the increase in net revenues, with Asia experiencing the biggest increase due to our growth initiatives in Asia.
103730_17_ITEM7_P179_S2	Distribution and the industrial and automotive end markets contributed the most to the revenue increase.
103730_17_ITEM7_P179_S3	Book-to-bill remains high and capital spending projects are underway to meet increased demand.
103730_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	The gross profit margin of the Resistors Inductors segment improved slightly over prior year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	The significant cost reduction savings were able to off-set declining selling prices, decreased royalty revenues, and general inflationary effects.
103730_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	Average selling prices have decreased slightly versus the prior years, consistent with our historical experience.
103730_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	In 2015, we announced global cost reduction programs which include targeted plans to streamline and consolidate certain product lines, including within our Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	Gross profit margins for the Capacitors segment were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment have decreased moderately in 2016 versus the prior year.
103730_17_ITEM7_P186_S1	The industrial end market was stable, whereas distribution and the automotive end market experienced significant decreases.
103730_17_ITEM7_P186_S2	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment continues to be negatively affected by the low activity level in the oil and gas industry as well as the discontinuation of government subsidies for renewable energy projects.
103730_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	The gross profit margin of the Capacitors segment in 2016 has increased versus the prior year mainly due to material price savings and the cost reduction program, which were able to offset the general cost inflation.
103730_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	Average selling prices decreased slightly versus the prior years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	In 2015, we announced global cost reduction programs which include targeted plans to streamline and consolidate certain product lines, including within our Capacitors segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P189_S1	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	In 2015, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $5.4 million in the Capacitors segment.
103730_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	The overall increase in SG A expenses in 2016 versus 2015 is primarily due to increased R D expenses, higher environmental remediation costs, and additional compensation costs in general, partially offset by lower amortization expense and our cost reduction programs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	The overall decrease in SG A expenses in 2015 versus 2014 is primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate effects, the benefits of our voluntary separation / early retirement program (see "Cost Management" above), and the non-repetition of additional SG A expenses incurred in 2014 to close acquisitions, partially offset by SG A expenses of acquired companies and additional compensation costs in general.
103730_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	Several items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	The acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech in the second fiscal quarter of 2014 and a controlling interest in Capella in the third fiscal quarter of 2014 increased our amortizable intangible assets balance by $78.2 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P194_S1	We recognized indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 and amortizable intangible asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P194_S2	Additionally, the remaining value of our impaired Siliconix tradenames, which were previously considered indefinite-lived, will be amortized over their remaining useful life of 10 years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P194_S3	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	In 2013 and 2015, we announced restructuring programs targeting SG A expenses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and "Cost Management" above.
103730_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $0.1 million versus the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P196_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher average outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures, partially offset by decreases in the estimated values of the embedded derivatives associated with our convertible debentures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $1.2 million versus the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the effective tax rates were 47.6%, 244.1%, and 29.5%, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P200_S1	The effective tax rates are generally less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
103730_17_ITEM7_P200_S2	While our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory rate, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is impacted by the write-off of a deferred tax asset in AOCI related to the U.S. pension plan settlement, and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is impacted by the tax-effect of the planned cash repatriation described below, and by a write-off of non-deductible goodwill and an impairment charge in a lower tax-rate jurisdiction.
103730_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 include certain discrete tax items for the pension plan settlement, repatriation transactions, changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_17_ITEM7_P201_S1	These items were $22.6 in 2016, $152.4 million in 2015, and $1.2 million (tax benefit) in 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the discrete items include $34.9 million of additional tax expense related to the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan (see above and Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements), $8.7 million (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions largely related to statute expiration, and $3.6 million tax benefit for periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the cash repatriation program described below.
103730_17_ITEM7_P202_S1	The cash repatriation program is expected to occur over several years, and the deferred tax liability is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each respective balance sheet date.
103730_17_ITEM7_P202_S2	Changes in the underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.
103730_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the discrete items included $164.0 million of expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily to repatriate $300.0 million of foreign earnings to the United States, following an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P203_S1	It also includes $8.9 million (tax benefit) for changes in valuation allowances and $2.6 million (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P204_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discrete items included $25.7 million of expense related to an expected repatriation of cash and profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States, primarily to repay amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility to provide future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition, a $25.7 million (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions, and a $1.2 million (tax benefit) recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the enactment of The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 that retroactively extended certain tax benefits from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM7_P205_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_17_ITEM7_P205_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_17_ITEM7_P205_S2	Part of our strategy has been to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_17_ITEM7_P205_S3	Accordingly, our effective tax rate is generally less than the U.S. statutory tax rate, except in 2016 and 2015 as described above.
103730_17_ITEM7_P206_S0	Changes in the effective tax rate are usually attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions, except in 2016 and 2015 as described above.
103730_17_ITEM7_P207_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P208_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_17_ITEM7_P208_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy, to reduce debt levels, and to pay dividends and repurchase stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P208_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 15 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 22 years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P209_S0	Management uses a non-GAAP measure, "free cash," to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_17_ITEM7_P209_S1	See "Overview" above for "free cash" definition and reconciliation to GAAP.
103730_17_ITEM7_P210_S0	Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 20 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 15 years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P210_S1	In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_17_ITEM7_P211_S0	We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash during the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P211_S1	Despite a slow start in terms of free cash generation and also partly due to the unusual pension contributions, we generated free cash in 2016 in line with our history.
103730_17_ITEM7_P211_S2	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_17_ITEM7_P212_S0	Beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we have reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company's capital structure.
103730_17_ITEM7_P212_S1	We have completed three issuances of low-coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance.
103730_17_ITEM7_P212_S2	We utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase approximately 24% of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives.
103730_17_ITEM7_P213_S0	On May 2, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P213_S1	The stock repurchase plan will expire on May 2, 2017.
103730_17_ITEM7_P213_S2	The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at our direction in accordance with the plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P213_S3	We have repurchased 1,752,454 shares of stock for $23.2 million since the inception of the plan.
103730_17_ITEM7_P214_S0	In 2016, we acquired, in two privately negotiated transactions, all of the outstanding exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_17_ITEM7_P214_S1	The total purchase price for the two transactions was $34.0 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P214_S2	The exchangeable unsecured notes were issued in 2002 in connection with an acquisition, and were subject to a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_17_ITEM7_P214_S3	The repurchased notes had been exchangeable for approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P215_S0	We also entered into a new, larger, revolving credit facility in 2010, which was amended and restated on August 8, 2013, and further amended and restated on December 10, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P215_S1	The amended and restated credit facility provides an aggregate commitment of $640 million of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020, and we have the ability to request up to $50 million of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P215_S2	The previous credit agreement was scheduled to mature on August 8, 2018.
103730_17_ITEM7_P215_S3	At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $143 million and $190 million, respectively, were outstanding under our credit facility.
103730_17_ITEM7_P216_S0	The amended and restated credit facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends to stockholders and share repurchases, provided our pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_17_ITEM7_P216_S1	If our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the credit facility allows such payments up to $75 million per annum (subject to a cap of $225 million for the term of the facility).
103730_17_ITEM7_P216_S2	The amended and restated credit facility provides us with significantly more flexibility to execute these transactions, and our ability to utilize some of our foreign-source income for these types of transactions provides even further financial flexibility.
103730_17_ITEM7_P217_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_17_ITEM7_P217_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
103730_17_ITEM7_P217_S2	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_17_ITEM7_P217_S3	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_17_ITEM7_P218_S0	We also pay a fee, also based on our leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts.
103730_17_ITEM7_P218_S1	The undrawn commitment fee, based on our current leverage ratio, is 0.35% per annum.
103730_17_ITEM7_P218_S2	Such undrawn commitment fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_17_ITEM7_P218_S3	Prior to the December 10, 2015 amendment and restatement, the credit agreement required Vishay to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount.
103730_17_ITEM7_P219_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P219_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P219_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM7_P220_S0	The credit facility also limits or restricts us, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, and making asset sales, and making other restricted payments (assuming our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1), and requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_17_ITEM7_P221_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_17_ITEM7_P221_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article VI of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 10, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P222_S0	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P222_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 12.17 to 1 and 1.97 to 1, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P222_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_17_ITEM7_P223_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_17_ITEM7_P223_S1	Additionally, our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_17_ITEM7_P224_S0	The balance of our revolving credit facility was $190 million at December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P224_S1	We borrowed $378 million and repaid $425 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P224_S2	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $199.8 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $248 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P225_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, our convertible senior debentures are convertible by the holders under certain circumstances.
103730_17_ITEM7_P225_S1	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2016 evaluation of the conversion criteria, due to the sale price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable period in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P225_S2	Such debentures will remain convertible until April 1, 2017, at which time the conversion criteria will be reevaluated.
103730_17_ITEM7_P225_S3	At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of our common stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P225_S4	We intend to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under our credit facility.
103730_17_ITEM7_P225_S5	Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible debentures due 2042 continues to be classified as a non-current liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P226_S0	Management expects to periodically pay down the balance of our revolving credit facility with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P226_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, regular dividend payments, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_17_ITEM7_P226_S2	Additional acquisition activity, share repurchases, or conversion of our convertible debentures may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_17_ITEM7_P226_S3	No principal payments on our outstanding debt are due before the maturity of our revolving credit facility in December 2020.
103730_17_ITEM7_P227_S0	As of December 31, 2016, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_17_ITEM7_P227_S1	Certain payments, such as cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_17_ITEM7_P227_S2	Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs.
103730_17_ITEM7_P228_S0	Our substantially undrawn credit facility provides us with significant liquidity in the United States.
103730_17_ITEM7_P229_S0	As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P229_S1	As a result of that evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings which we expect to repatriate to the U.S. over the next several years.
103730_17_ITEM7_P229_S2	We repatriated $46.0 million pursuant to this program in 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P230_S0	Except as described above, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_17_ITEM7_P230_S1	If additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the United States, in addition to various foreign country laws regulating the exportation of the cash and profits, we would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM7_P231_S0	We invest a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM7_P231_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_17_ITEM7_P232_S0	The interest rates on our short-term investments average 0.4% and are approximately 4 basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_17_ITEM7_P232_S1	The interest rates on our short-term investments were negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment in Europe.
103730_17_ITEM7_P232_S2	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_17_ITEM7_P233_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively (in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P234_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_17_ITEM7_P235_S0	"Net cash and short-term investments (debt)" does not have a uniform definition and is not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_17_ITEM7_P235_S1	This measure should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_17_ITEM7_P235_S2	However, management believes that an analysis of "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_17_ITEM7_P236_S0	The measure, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_17_ITEM7_P237_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2016 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 4.1 to 1, unchanged from December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P237_S1	The decrease in inventory and increase in trade accounts payable was offset by decreases in accrued expenses.
103730_17_ITEM7_P237_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity was 0.23 to 1 at December 31, 2016 as compared to a ratio of 0.27 to 1 at December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P237_S3	The decrease in the ratio is primarily due to the repurchase of exchangeable notes and credit facility repayments.
103730_17_ITEM7_P238_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $296.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $245.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P238_S1	The improvement in operating cash flows is primarily due to the increase in net earnings.
103730_17_ITEM7_P238_S2	Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.0 million of cash contributions to our Taiwanese pension plans and restructuring payments of $33.0 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P239_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $134.6 million, as compared to $147.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7_P239_S1	We expect capital spending of approximately $150 million in 2017.
103730_17_ITEM7_P240_S0	Cash paid for dividends to our common and Class B common stockholders totalled $36.7 million and $35.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM7_P240_S1	We expect dividend payments in 2017 to total approximately $36.5 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P240_S2	However, any future dividend declaration and payment remains subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
103730_17_ITEM7_P241_S0	Cash paid for the purchase and deposits for businesses, net of cash acquired for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.8 million.
103730_17_ITEM7_P241_S1	The amount represents a deposit made in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, for the acquisition Sonntag, which was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P242_S0	As of December 31, 2016 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM7_P243_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_17_ITEM7_P243_S1	Accordingly, the discounts and capitalized deferred financing costs associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_17_ITEM7_P244_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement and include fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on December 10, 2020.
103730_17_ITEM7_P244_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042.
103730_17_ITEM7_P245_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_17_ITEM7_P245_S1	Among other things, approximately $575 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.
103730_17_ITEM7_P245_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_17_ITEM7_P245_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2016, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_17_ITEM7_P246_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 includes liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_17_ITEM7_P246_S1	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_17_ITEM7_P246_S2	Accordingly, we have classified the amount recorded as a current liability as payable within one year, and the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_17_ITEM7_P247_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_17_ITEM7_P247_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_17_ITEM7_P247_S2	See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_17_ITEM7_P247_S3	These obligations are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above, but were not material to us as of December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P248_S0	Expected pension and postretirement plan funding is based on a projected schedule of benefit payments under the plans.
103730_17_ITEM7_P249_S0	We maintain long-term foundry arrangements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_17_ITEM7_P249_S1	The purchase commitments in the table above represent the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these arrangements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P249_S2	Our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments.
103730_17_ITEM7_P250_S0	Other long-term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7_P250_S1	We include the current portion of the long-term liabilities in the table above.
103730_17_ITEM7_P250_S2	Other long-term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_17_ITEM7_P251_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM7_P252_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_17_ITEM7_P253_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_17_ITEM7_P253_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition and other market conditions, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_17_ITEM7_P254_S0	See also "Commodity Price Risk" included in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional related information.
103730_17_ITEM7_P255_S0	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	At December 31, 2016, we had $143.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2016, we have $471.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $626.6 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2016, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $3.3 million.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Also see "Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of these exposures.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We entered into forward contracts with highly-rated financial institutions to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The notional amount of the forward contracts was $100 million as of December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The forward contracts are short-term in nature and are expected to be renewed at our discretion until the intercompany loans are repaid.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P8_S3	We have not designated the forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and as such the change in the fair value of contracts is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We do not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S6	Where possible, we maintain local currency denominated cash balances in these countries approximately equal to the local currency liabilities to naturally hedge our exposures.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S7	We also have a slightly higher percentage of euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S8	Therefore, when the euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is slightly increased.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P10_S9	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses of our consolidated foreign exchange risk as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P11_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $9.1 million and $7.8 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P11_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange gains of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P13_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P15_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P15_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P16_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P16_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P17_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P18_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_17_ITEM7A_P19_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $5.1 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.
103730_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1 of this report.
103730_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

103730_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s management.
103730_17_ITEM15_P49_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
103730_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
103730_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
103730_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.:
103730_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
103730_17_ITEM15_P55_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
103730_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_17_ITEM15_P56_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_17_ITEM15_P56_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria .
103730_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 and our report dated February 17, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_17_ITEM15_P63_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P63_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_17_ITEM15_P63_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_17_ITEM15_P63_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_17_ITEM15_P65_S2	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, "stock, ship and debit" credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_17_ITEM15_P66_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P66_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $259, $3,323, and $4,525 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company records royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
103730_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	Vishay earns royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property.
103730_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	Accordingly, the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on periodic reporting to Vishay by its licensees, and based on judgments and estimates by Vishay management, which management considers reasonable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $66,842, $64,193, and $65,299, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_17_ITEM15_P72_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_17_ITEM15_P72_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of "more likely than not" to be realized.
103730_17_ITEM15_P72_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P72_S4	If the Company's assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_17_ITEM15_P72_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	Except as described in Note 5, earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_17_ITEM15_P73_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_17_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_17_ITEM15_P75_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P75_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_17_ITEM15_P76_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_17_ITEM15_P76_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	The amount included in current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect only amounts expected to be settled in cash within one year.
103730_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P78_S2	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year.
103730_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_17_ITEM15_P80_S1	If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_17_ITEM15_P80_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $61, $(152), and $(424) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_17_ITEM15_P81_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P82_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P82_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.
103730_17_ITEM15_P82_S4	The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at December 31, 2016 was approximately $43,383.
103730_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense.
103730_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	Depreciation expense was $144,521, $154,340, and $160,804 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and administrative expenses).
103730_17_ITEM15_P84_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	Certain of the Company's tradenames were assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_17_ITEM15_P86_S3	The Company's business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P86_S4	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment tests performed in 2016 and 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	Capitalized software is amortized over periods of three to ten years, primarily included in costs of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P87_S3	Customer relationships are amortized over useful lives of five to twenty years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P87_S4	Noncompete agreements are amortized over periods of three to ten years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P87_S5	The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	GAAP prescribes a two-step quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two-step quantitative impairment test.
103730_17_ITEM15_P88_S2	If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not required.
103730_17_ITEM15_P88_S3	If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is required.
103730_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would then perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test, which requires allocation of the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill.
103730_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	An impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
103730_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets before performing a quantitative impairment test.
103730_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	Upon determining that an intangible asset classified as indefinite-lived is impaired, the Company reassesses the useful life of the impaired assets and begins to amortize the remaining carrying value over that useful life if it is determined that the asset no longer has an indefinite useful life.
103730_17_ITEM15_P91_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the Company has no indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P91_S3	See Note 3 for further information.
103730_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for anticipated disposal costs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment tests performed in 2016 and 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	Short-term investments and other assets reported on the consolidated balance sheets include time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year and investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_17_ITEM15_P95_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11) and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_17_ITEM15_P95_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_17_ITEM15_P95_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until sold.
103730_17_ITEM15_P95_S4	At the time of sale, the assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P96_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_17_ITEM15_P96_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_17_ITEM15_P98_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_17_ITEM15_P98_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_17_ITEM15_P98_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company uses financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to mitigate a portion, but not all, of the risk associated with its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	The purpose of the Company's foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, held-to-maturity short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported on the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
103730_17_ITEM15_P104_S1	For options and restricted stock units subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs") that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_17_ITEM15_P106_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM15_P106_S2	The Company's operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_17_ITEM15_P107_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P107_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_17_ITEM15_P107_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_17_ITEM15_P108_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_17_ITEM15_P109_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2016 and 2015 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	Restructuring and severance costs reflect charges resulting from cost reduction programs implemented by the Company.
103730_17_ITEM15_P111_S1	Restructuring and severance costs include exit costs, severance benefits pursuant to an on-going arrangement, voluntary termination compensation under a defined program, and any related pension curtailment and settlement charges.
103730_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	The Company recognizes expense for one-time benefits only after management has committed to a plan, the plan is sufficiently detailed to provide the number, classification, and location of employees to be terminated as well as the expected completion date, the plan has been sufficiently communicated to employees such that they are able to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if terminated, and it is unlikely that the plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.
103730_17_ITEM15_P112_S1	If an employee is not required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense once the aforementioned criteria have been met.
103730_17_ITEM15_P112_S2	If an employee is required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense over the period that the employee is required to render future service.
103730_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company recognizes expense for on-going benefit arrangements when the liability is reasonably estimable and considered probable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	The Company recognizes expense for voluntary separation / early retirement when the employee delivers an irrevocable voluntary termination notice pursuant to a defined company program.
103730_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Company recognizes other exit costs as incurred.
103730_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers' liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_17_ITEM15_P117_S1	At December 31, 2016, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors' and officers' insurance.
103730_17_ITEM15_P117_S2	The captive insurance entity had $5,000 accrued related to the Tianjin explosion at December 31, 2015 (See Note 8), and had no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_17_ITEM15_P118_S1	Restricted cash of $10,211 and $11,627 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_17_ITEM15_P119_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_17_ITEM15_P119_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_17_ITEM15_P119_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_17_ITEM15_P121_S0	No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .
103730_17_ITEM15_P122_S0	The ASU is the result of the FASB's simplification initiative intended to improve GAAP by reducing costs and complexity while maintaining or enhancing the usefulness of related financial statement information.
103730_17_ITEM15_P122_S1	The ASU eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively, and to instead recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which the acquirer determines the amount, including the effect on earnings of any amounts which would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
103730_17_ITEM15_P122_S2	The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P122_S3	The ASU had no effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (SubTopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
103730_17_ITEM15_P123_S1	The ASU requires the Company's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
103730_17_ITEM15_P123_S2	The Company adopted the ASU effective December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P123_S3	The ASU had no effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P124_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .
103730_17_ITEM15_P124_S1	The ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
103730_17_ITEM15_P124_S2	The ASU removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; provides more useful information to users of financial statements through expanded disclosure requirements; and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.
103730_17_ITEM15_P124_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with the ability to early adopt on January 1, 2017.
103730_17_ITEM15_P124_S4	The Company intends to retrospectively adopt the ASU effective January 1, 2018.
103730_17_ITEM15_P124_S5	Based on work performed to date, the adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P125_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
103730_17_ITEM15_P125_S1	The ASU is the result of a project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company will recognize lease assets and liabilities for its operating leases which are not currently reported on its consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P125_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with the ability to early adopt.
103730_17_ITEM15_P125_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its lease contracts.
103730_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
103730_17_ITEM15_P126_S1	The ASU is the result of the FASB's simplification initiative intended to improve GAAP by reducing costs and complexity while maintaining or enhancing the usefulness of related financial statement information.
103730_17_ITEM15_P126_S2	The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
103730_17_ITEM15_P126_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with the ability to early adopt.
103730_17_ITEM15_P126_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its employee share-based payment accounting.

103730_17_ITEM15_P127_S1	The ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
103730_17_ITEM15_P127_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, with the ability to early adopt for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
103730_17_ITEM15_P127_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its financial assets measured at amortized cost.
103730_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified.
103730_17_ITEM15_P128_S1	Such reclassifications had no effect on reported net earnings (loss) attributable to Vishay stockholders, total assets, stockholders' equity, or the statements of cash flows.
103730_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company deposited the $6,750 purchase price of Sonntag Electronic GmbH ("Sonntag").
103730_17_ITEM15_P130_S1	The purchase price, net of cash acquired was $5,450.
103730_17_ITEM15_P130_S2	The acquisition was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	Sonntag is a distributor of electronic components in Germany.
103730_17_ITEM15_P131_S1	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P131_S2	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $3,485 related to this acquisition.
103730_17_ITEM15_P131_S3	The goodwill related to this acquisition is included in the Resistors Inductors reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
103730_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	Vishay did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	On June 11, 2014, Vishay acquired Holy Stone Polytech Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone Polytech"), a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors and formerly a subsidiary of Holy Stone Enterprise Co. Ltd., for $20,576, net of cash acquired.
103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S1	The Company is using the technology acquired to begin to penetrate the polymer tantalum capacitor market .
103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations of Holy Stone Polytech have been included in the Capacitors segment since June 11, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S3	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S4	Based on an estimate of their fair values, the Company allocated $3,736 of the purchase price to definite-lived intangible assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S5	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $6,328 related to this acquisition.

103730_17_ITEM15_P134_S7	See Note 3 for further information.
103730_17_ITEM15_P135_S0	On July 11, 2014, Vishay entered into an agreement to acquire Capella for approximately $205,000.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S0	Capella is a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic products.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S1	As a first step in the acquisition, Vishay launched a tender offer for Capella's outstanding shares.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S2	A total of 38,703,705 shares of Capella, or 88.95% of outstanding shares, were tendered and accepted by Vishay.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S3	The offer period expired on September 1, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the tender offer, Vishay paid NT$139 for each share tendered.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S5	The aggregate purchase price was $180,167.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S6	Capella had cash and short-term investments on hand of $50,195 at the date of acquisition.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S7	Vishay funded the acquisition with cash on hand and $53,000 of borrowings under its credit facility.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S8	Subsequent to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in December 31, 2014, the Company repatriated cash from the current earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States primarily to repay those borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and also to realign the acquired entity structure to have Capella's U.S. subsidiary directly owned by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_17_ITEM15_P136_S9	The acquisition has strengthened the in-house design capabilities of our entire optoelectronic components business.
103730_17_ITEM15_P137_S0	Upon the close of the tender offer, Vishay controlled Capella and began consolidating it in its financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P138_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the results and operations and net assets of Capella are included in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P138_S1	Capella's results were not material to the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P139_S0	Vishay acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Capella on December 31, 2014 pursuant to the merger agreement.
103730_17_ITEM15_P139_S1	In connection with the closing of the merger, all remaining holders of Capella common stock other than Vishay and its subsidiaries received the same consideration for their shares as the holders who tendered their shares in the tender offer, or $21,067 in the aggregate.
103730_17_ITEM15_P140_S0	In evaluating the acquisition of Capella, the Company focused primarily on the ability to synergize Capella's optoelectronics design capabilities with Vishay's existing optoelectronics product lines and customers.
103730_17_ITEM15_P140_S1	As a result, the fair value of the acquired assets, including identified intangible assets, corresponds to a relatively smaller portion of the acquisition price, with the Company recording a substantial amount of goodwill associated with the acquisition.
103730_17_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $57,600 in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 to write-down acquired Capella assets to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM15_P141_S1	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment charges.
103730_17_ITEM15_P142_S0	The Company recognized $843 of acquisition costs classified as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P143_S0	The unaudited pro forma results would have been as follows, assuming the 2014 acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2014:
103730_17_ITEM15_P144_S0	The pro forma information presented for the year ended December 31, 2014 was adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs incurred in 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P144_S1	The pro forma information also includes adjustments for interest expense that would have been incurred to finance the acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets (excluding effects of the 2015 impairment charges), depreciation of acquired property and equipment, and tax related effects.
103730_17_ITEM15_P145_S0	The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been attained had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P146_S0	As a result of a review of recent financial results and outlook for the MOSFETs segment following the recent completion of production transfers, Vishay determined that an interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was required for its Siliconix tradenames as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P147_S0	As a result of this analysis, the Company determined that its Siliconix tradenames, with a carrying value of $20,359, were impaired.
103730_17_ITEM15_P147_S1	The Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,559 to write-down the tradenames to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM15_P147_S2	The tradenames are no longer considered indefinite-lived and the remaining value will be amortized over the 10 year estimated remaining useful life.
103730_17_ITEM15_P148_S0	The fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_17_ITEM15_P149_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P149_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and its peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described in Note 4), Vishay determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P151_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with the Company's Capella business were not recoverable, and the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $57,600 to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	After completing step one of the goodwill impairment test, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Capacitors reporting unit was less than the net book value of that reporting unit, requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment evaluation.
103730_17_ITEM15_P152_S1	Upon completion of the step two analysis for the Capacitors reporting unit, the Company recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $5,380.
103730_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	The fair value of long-lived assets is measured primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P153_S2	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	The fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes is measured primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the reporting unit.
103730_17_ITEM15_P154_S1	The calculated results are evaluated for reasonableness using comparable company data.
103730_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P155_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, completed technology, tradenames, customer relationships, and certain property and equipment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_17_ITEM15_P157_S1	Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge; could have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	The Company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_17_ITEM15_P158_S1	The interim impairment tests performed as the last day of the third fiscal quarters of 2016 and 2015, were effectively the annual impairment tests for 2016 and 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	The recorded impairment charges are non-cash in nature and do not affect Vishay's liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $14,842, $21,829, and $18,651, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2016 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Company places a strong emphasis on controlling its costs and combats general price inflation by continuously improving its efficiency and operating performance.
103730_17_ITEM15_P164_S1	When the ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate, the Company takes actions to maintain its cost competitiveness.
103730_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company incurred significant restructuring costs in its past to reduce its cost structure.
103730_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	Historically, the Company's primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P166_S1	Since 2013, the Company's cost reduction programs have primarily focused on reducing fixed costs, including selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	In 2013, the Company announced various cost reduction programs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P167_S1	These programs were substantially implemented by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016, with some additional costs incurred in the remainder of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P167_S2	Many of the severance costs were recognized ratably over the required stay periods.
103730_17_ITEM15_P167_S3	In November 2016, the Company announced an extension of one of these programs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	In 2015, the Company announced additional global cost reduction programs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P168_S1	These programs include a facility closure in the Netherlands.
103730_17_ITEM15_P168_S2	The cash costs of these programs, primarily severance, are expected to aggregate to approximately $30,000.
103730_17_ITEM15_P168_S3	Complete implementation of these programs is expected to occur before the end of 2017.
103730_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	The following table summarizes restructuring and related expenses which were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 and reported on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:
103730_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	Over a period of approximately 2 years and in a period of discrete steps, the manufacture of wafers for a substantial share of products was transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_17_ITEM15_P170_S1	As a consequence, certain other manufacturing previously occurring in-house was transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P170_S2	This transfer of production was substantially completed by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	Employees generally were required to remain with the Company during the production transfer period.
103730_17_ITEM15_P171_S1	Accordingly, the Company accrued these severance costs ratably over the respective employees' remaining service periods.
103730_17_ITEM15_P171_S2	The Company has incurred and may continue to incur other exit costs associated with the production transfer, including certain contract termination costs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	As a result of a review of recent financial results and outlook for the Company's MOSFETs segment following the recent completion of production transfers, the Company has determined to implement further cost reductions for the MOSFETs segment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	On November 7, 2016, the Company announced an extension of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_17_ITEM15_P173_S1	The revised program includes various cost reduction initiatives, primarily the transfer of all remaining manufacturing operations at its Santa Clara, California facility to other Vishay facilities or third-party subcontractors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P173_S2	The production transfers will be completed in steps by the end of 2017.
103730_17_ITEM15_P173_S3	The Company expects to incur cash charges of approximately $4,000 to $8,000, primarily related to severance, to implement these additional steps.
103730_17_ITEM15_P173_S4	The total cash charges for the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program are expected to be $23,000 to $27,000.
103730_17_ITEM15_P173_S5	The Company expects to maintain its R D and management presence in the Silicon Valley area, even after the cessation of manufacturing operations there.
103730_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P175_S1	Other exit costs of $5,763 are included in the expenses incurred in 2016 in the table above.
103730_17_ITEM15_P175_S2	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement program was offered to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	The program benefits varied by country and job classification, but generally included a cash loyalty bonus based on years of service.
103730_17_ITEM15_P176_S2	All employees eligible for the program have left the Company.
103730_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	These employees generally were not aligned with any particular segment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P177_S1	The effective separation / retirement date for most employees who accepted the offer was June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a transition period.
103730_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	The payment terms vary by country, but generally were paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P179_S1	Certain participants are being paid in installments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P179_S2	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	In an effort to reduce costs and streamline production of its module products within its Diodes segment, the Company committed to two smaller cost reduction programs related to the transferring of production of certain of its products.
103730_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	The Company recorded restructuring and severance costs of $2,080 for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to these production transfer programs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	Substantially all amounts related to these programs have been paid as of December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	The global cost reduction programs announced in 2015 include a plan to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and targeted streamlining and consolidation of production for certain product lines within its Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following table summarizes the expense recognized by segment related to this program:
103730_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P185_S1	The current portion of the liability is $5,890 and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
103730_17_ITEM15_P185_S2	The non-current portion of the liability is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
103730_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and noncontrolling interests consists of the following components:
103730_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	Significant components of income taxes are as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	The Company makes significant judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets (principally net operating losses).
103730_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	The carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on the Company's assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize these assets after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.
103730_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to actual income tax provision is as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 includes certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances, tax rates, and other related items.
103730_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	These items total $22,596, $152,437, and $1,228 (tax benefit) in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the discrete items include $34,853 of additional tax expense related to the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan (see Notes 10 and 11), $8,704 (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions related largely to statute expiration, and $3,553 (tax benefit) for periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the cash repatriation program described below.
103730_17_ITEM15_P192_S1	The cash repatriation program is expected to occur over several years, and the deferred tax liability is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each respective balance sheet date.
103730_17_ITEM15_P192_S2	Changes in the underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.
103730_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the discrete items include $163,954 of expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily to repatriate $300,000 of foreign earnings to the United States, following an evaluation of the Company's anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and the Company's most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P193_S1	They also include $8,888 (tax benefit) for changes in valuation allowances and $2,629 (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the discrete items included $25,706 of expense related to an expected repatriation of cash and profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States, primarily to repay amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility to provide future flexibility given the legal entity and the financial structure utilized for the Capella acquisition, a $25,706 (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions, and a $1,228 (tax benefit) recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the enactment of The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P195_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had the following significant net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes:
103730_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had the following significant tax credit carryforwards available:
103730_17_ITEM15_P197_S0	At December 31, 2016, no provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $2,484,372 of foreign earnings, which are deemed to be reinvested outside of the United States indefinitely.
103730_17_ITEM15_P197_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P198_S0	Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_17_ITEM15_P199_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company recognized income tax expense, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300,000 of foreign earnings, (including $20,000 of 2015 earnings and $280,000 of earnings from prior periods).
103730_17_ITEM15_P199_S1	This tax expense was recognized in 2015 following an evaluation of the Company's anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and the Company's most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P199_S2	The Company repatriated $46,000 pursuant to this program in 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P200_S0	During 2014, the Company recognized income tax expense on foreign earnings in anticipation of a repatriation intended to pay $53,000 of borrowings on its revolving credit facility used for the Capella acquisition (see Note 2).
103730_17_ITEM15_P200_S1	The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2014 included all U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P200_S2	That repatriation was completed in 2015 .
103730_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	Net income taxes paid were $58,788, $49,301, and $62,051 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P202_S0	See Note 19 for a discussion of the tax-related uncertainties for the pre-spin-off period of Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("VPG"), which was spun off on July 6, 2010.
103730_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_17_ITEM15_P204_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits of $16,805 and $23,527, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized.
103730_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_17_ITEM15_P205_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $1,638 and $3,887, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P205_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recognized $542, $785, and $1,839, respectively, in interest and penalties.
103730_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P206_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, certain tax examinations were completed and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P206_S2	The tax provision for those years includes adjustments related to the resolution of these matters, as reflected in the table above.
103730_17_ITEM15_P206_S3	The tax returns of other non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include Germany (2009 through 2012), India (2004 through 2013), Israel (2013 through 2014), and Taiwan (2014).
103730_17_ITEM15_P206_S4	The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examinations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P207_S0	The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that result from such examinations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P207_S1	These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current unrecognized tax benefits.
103730_17_ITEM15_P207_S2	The Company believes that in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations will conclude or the statutes of limitation on certain income tax periods open to examination will expire, or both.
103730_17_ITEM15_P207_S3	Given the uncertainties described above, the Company can only determine an estimate of potential decreases in unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $57 to $6,866.
103730_17_ITEM15_P208_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_17_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility").
103730_17_ITEM15_P209_S1	On December 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate commitment of $640,000 of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020.
103730_17_ITEM15_P209_S2	The credit agreement initially became effective December 1, 2010 and was first amended and restated on August 8, 2013.
103730_17_ITEM15_P209_S3	The Credit Facility, as amended and restated, also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $50,000 of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P210_S0	Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_17_ITEM15_P210_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on Vishay's leverage ratio.
103730_17_ITEM15_P211_S0	Based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_17_ITEM15_P211_S1	Vishay also pays a fee, also based on its leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts.
103730_17_ITEM15_P211_S2	The undrawn commitment fee, based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, is 0.35% per annum.
103730_17_ITEM15_P211_S3	The previous credit agreement required Vishay to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount.
103730_17_ITEM15_P212_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_17_ITEM15_P212_S1	If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows such payments up to $75,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $225,000 for the term of the facility).
103730_17_ITEM15_P213_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P213_S1	Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P213_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P213_S3	The Credit Facility also limits or restricts the Company and its subsidiaries, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on its respective assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and making other restricted payments (assuming the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1), and requires the Company to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_17_ITEM15_P214_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility also removes certain restrictions related to intercompany transactions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P214_S1	These changes are expected to enable the Company to streamline its complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_17_ITEM15_P215_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, material misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P215_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the Company's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_17_ITEM15_P216_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was $490,136 and $442,745, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.
103730_17_ITEM15_P216_S1	Letters of credit totaling $6,864 and $7,255 were outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P217_S0	Vishay currently has three issuances of convertible senior debentures outstanding with generally congruent terms.
103730_17_ITEM15_P217_S1	The quarterly cash dividend program of the Company results in adjustments to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for each issuance of the Company's convertible senior debentures effective as of the ex-dividend date of each cash dividend.
103730_17_ITEM15_P218_S0	The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the three series of outstanding convertible senior debentures following the adjustment made to the conversion rate of the debentures on the ex-dividend date of the December 22, 2016 dividend payment:
103730_17_ITEM15_P219_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_17_ITEM15_P220_S0	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2016 evaluation of the conversion criteria, due to the sale price of Vishay's common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable period in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P220_S1	The debentures due 2042 will remain convertible until April 1, 2017, at which time the conversion criteria will be reevaluated.
103730_17_ITEM15_P220_S2	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon future conversion of any of the convertible senior debentures, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock .
103730_17_ITEM15_P220_S3	The excess of the amount that the Company would pay to the holders of the debentures due 2042 upon conversion over the carrying value of the liability component of the debentures currently convertible has been reclassifed as temporary equity on the consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P220_S4	The Company intends to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under its credit facility.
103730_17_ITEM15_P220_S5	Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible debentures due 2042 continues to be classified as a non-current liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P221_S0	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "fundamental change" in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_17_ITEM15_P222_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to the respective call dates.
103730_17_ITEM15_P222_S1	On or after the call date and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay's common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_17_ITEM15_P223_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_17_ITEM15_P223_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_17_ITEM15_P224_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures are reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P225_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company's estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_17_ITEM15_P225_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances beginning ten years subsequent to issuance.
103730_17_ITEM15_P226_S0	Interest expense related to the debentures is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
103730_17_ITEM15_P227_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_17_ITEM15_P227_S1	The notes are governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_17_ITEM15_P227_S2	The notes could be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, could be called by Vishay for similar consideration.
103730_17_ITEM15_P228_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, by reason of the spin-off of VPG on July 6, 2010, Vishay was required to take action so that the existing notes were deemed exchanged as of the date of the spin-off, for a combination of new notes of Vishay reflecting a lower principal amount of the notes and new notes issued by VPG.
103730_17_ITEM15_P229_S0	Based on the relative trading prices of Vishay and VPG common stock on the ten trading days following the spin-off, Vishay retained the liability for an aggregate $95,042 principal amount of exchangeable notes effective July 6, 2010.
103730_17_ITEM15_P229_S1	The assumption of a portion of the liability by VPG was recorded as a reduction in parent net investment just prior to the completion of the spin-off.
103730_17_ITEM15_P230_S0	Under the terms of the put and call agreement, the holders could have, at any time, put the notes to Vishay in exchange for shares of Vishay's common stock, and Vishay could have called the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of its common stock at any time after January 2, 2018.
103730_17_ITEM15_P230_S1	Subsequent to the spin-off of VPG, the put/call rate of the Vishay notes was $15.39 per share of common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P231_S0	The payment of quarterly cash dividends did not affect the put/call rate of the notes (See Note 7).
103730_17_ITEM15_P232_S0	In 2013, a holder of the notes exercised its option to exchange $56,400 principal amount of the notes for 3,664,729 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P232_S1	Following this transaction, Vishay had outstanding exchangeable unsecured notes with a principal amount of $38,642, which were exchangeable for an aggregate of 2,511,742 shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P233_S0	On June 28, 2016 and March 31, 2016, pursuant to agreements dated June 13, 2016 and March 10, 2016, respectively, the Company acquired from holders $12,436 and $26,206, respectively, principal amount of the Company's floating rate exchangeable unsecured notes due 2102.
103730_17_ITEM15_P233_S1	The purchase price for these privately negotiated transactions was $11,449 and $22,595, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P233_S2	Vishay recognized gains on early extinguishment of debt of $4,597 presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P234_S0	Following the June 28, 2016 transaction, no exchangeable unsecured notes are outstanding.
103730_17_ITEM15_P235_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P236_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_17_ITEM15_P236_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_17_ITEM15_P237_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $11,000, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P237_S1	At December 31, 2015, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $13,700, with substantially no amounts borrowed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P238_S0	Interest paid was $19,316, $19,134, and $18,394 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P239_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
103730_17_ITEM15_P240_S0	The Company's Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share while the common stock carries 1 vote per share.
103730_17_ITEM15_P240_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P240_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P240_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P241_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P241_S1	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_17_ITEM15_P241_S2	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.
103730_17_ITEM15_P242_S0	In 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.
103730_17_ITEM15_P242_S1	Cash dividends were paid quarterly in 2016 and 2015 as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_17_ITEM15_P243_S1	If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows such payments up to $75,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $225,000 for the term of the facility).
103730_17_ITEM15_P243_S2	The amount and timing of any future stock repurchases or cash dividends remains subject to authorization of the Company's Board of Directors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P244_S0	At December 31, 2016, the Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P245_S0	*At December 31, 2016, the convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are convertible into 20,931,983, 8,331,840, and 13,424,175 shares, respectively, of Vishay common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P245_S1	The Company has reserved adequate shares to ensure it could issue the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_17_ITEM15_P246_S0	The caption "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:
103730_17_ITEM15_P247_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_17_ITEM15_P247_S1	Vishay owns and operates a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_17_ITEM15_P247_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_17_ITEM15_P247_S3	Full production resumed on September 8, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P248_S0	As a result of this incident, the Company recorded, as a separate line on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, a loss of $5,350 related to these items, which represented the insurance deductible and certain costs which were considered to be not recoverable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P249_S0	The Company's insurance coverage generally provides for replacement cost of damaged items.
103730_17_ITEM15_P249_S1	Any amount received in excess of the book value is treated as a gain.
103730_17_ITEM15_P249_S2	The Company also had business interruption claims under its insurance policies.
103730_17_ITEM15_P249_S3	The Company did not record any gains on damaged property or business interruption income until all contingencies were resolved.
103730_17_ITEM15_P250_S0	During 2016, the Company received proceeds totaling $13,406 under its various insurance policies, of which $4,911 is classified as proceeds from the sale of property and equipment on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, and the remainder is considered cash flows from operating activities.
103730_17_ITEM15_P250_S1	The Company recorded, as a separate line on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, a gain of $8,809, equal to the proceeds received less the costs incurred for inventory, property, and equipment damage (at net book value) and related repair and clean-up costs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P251_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_17_ITEM15_P252_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_17_ITEM15_P253_S0	Reclassifications of pension and other post-retirement actuarial items out of AOCI, including the recognition of the settlement charge for the termination of the Vishay Retirement Plan in 2016, are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 11).
103730_17_ITEM15_P254_S0	Historically, valuation allowances were recorded against the deferred taxes associated with certain unrecognized pension and other postretirement actuarial items.
103730_17_ITEM15_P254_S1	Changes in estimates related to these valuation allowances are recorded in the statement of operations and do not affect accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying pension or other postretirement benefit plan is extinguished.
103730_17_ITEM15_P254_S2	As a result of the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan, the Company recorded $34,853 of additional income tax expense and the related reclassification adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income related to changes in estimates recorded in 2010.
103730_17_ITEM15_P255_S0	The amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of securities held by the Company's rabbi trust used to fund a deferred compensation plan was $0, $680, and $24 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P255_S1	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of compensation expense within Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P256_S0	The pre-tax amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of available-for-sale securities was $0, $0, and $54 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P256_S1	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of Other Income on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P256_S2	The tax effect of the reclassifications of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities is recorded as a component of Income Tax Expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P257_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay's proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_17_ITEM15_P258_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_17_ITEM15_P259_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_17_ITEM15_P259_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_17_ITEM15_P260_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_17_ITEM15_P261_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_17_ITEM15_P262_S0	The Company maintains several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_17_ITEM15_P262_S1	These include pension plans which are "qualified" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code, and "non-qualified" pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_17_ITEM15_P263_S0	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P264_S0	The Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee issued new mortality tables and a new mortality improvement scale in 2014.
103730_17_ITEM15_P264_S1	The new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale are based on a recent study of mortality experience in the United States, and reflect improved retiree longevity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P264_S2	The use of the new mortality tables and mortality improvement scale increased the Company's projected benefit obligations by approximately $24,000 in 2014 and will increase future net periodic pension cost.
103730_17_ITEM15_P264_S3	An updated mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries in 2015 reduced the Company's benefit obligation by approximately $8,000, which mitigates the increased future net periodic pension cost resulting from the new mortality tables.
103730_17_ITEM15_P264_S4	An updated mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries in 2016 did not have a material effect .
103730_17_ITEM15_P265_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans historically included both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_17_ITEM15_P265_S1	The Company's principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_17_ITEM15_P265_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P266_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_17_ITEM15_P266_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees could participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits accrued after December 31, 2008.
103730_17_ITEM15_P266_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company has made additional cash contributions to the plan to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_17_ITEM15_P266_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_17_ITEM15_P267_S0	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P267_S1	All of the Company's qualified U.S. pension plans have been merged into the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, the Company executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with its U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S1	These transactions included the purchase of annuity contracts for approximately 700 participants pursuant to an arrangement inherited in a past acquisition and a special limited-time voluntary lump-sum payment offer to certain former employees who were deferred vested participants of the plan not currently receiving periodic payments of their pension benefit.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S2	A total of 800 participants accepted the voluntary lump-sum offer.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S3	The plan is no longer obligated to pay any benefits to the 1,500 participants covered by these two settlement transactions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S4	These former participants represented approximately 23% of the total participants prior to executing these transactions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S5	These partial-settlement transactions were funded entirely with plan assets and resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15,588, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_17_ITEM15_P268_S6	These non-cash charges are presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S0	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company began the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S1	During the third fiscal quarter of 2016, the Company received a favorable determination letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and met all other applicable IRS and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation requirements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S2	The termination and settlement occurred in December 2016.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S3	Plan participants had their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S4	The settlement resulted in a non-cash charge of $79,321 to recognize the unrecognized actuarial items related to the Vishay Retirement Plan recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S5	These non-cash charges are presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S6	The termination and settlement required no additional cash contributions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P269_S7	Excess plan assets will be transferred to a qualified defined contribution retirement plan, and are presented on the accompanying reconciliation as a negative Company contribution.
103730_17_ITEM15_P270_S0	The Company's principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_17_ITEM15_P270_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan is identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_17_ITEM15_P271_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_17_ITEM15_P271_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_17_ITEM15_P271_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_17_ITEM15_P271_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P271_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $22,896 and $21,137 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P272_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_17_ITEM15_P272_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_17_ITEM15_P272_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_17_ITEM15_P272_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_17_ITEM15_P273_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_17_ITEM15_P273_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_17_ITEM15_P274_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_17_ITEM15_P274_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_17_ITEM15_P274_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_17_ITEM15_P274_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_17_ITEM15_P274_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P274_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $2,389 and $2,995 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P275_S0	In 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to modify Dr. Gerald Paul's and the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors determined to modify Mr. Marc Zandman's employment arrangements such that upon any termination (other than for cause) after attaining age 62, the executive would be entitled to the same payments and benefits he would have received if his respective employment was terminated by Vishay without cause or by the respective executive for good reason.
103730_17_ITEM15_P275_S1	These modifications were included in formal amendments signed on August 8, 2010.
103730_17_ITEM15_P275_S2	The expense associated with the modifications to the employment arrangements of Dr. Gerald Paul and Mr. Marc Zandman effectively represents a defined retirement benefit that will be recognized over the remaining service period of the individuals.
103730_17_ITEM15_P276_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.

103730_17_ITEM15_P285_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
103730_17_ITEM15_P286_S0	The plans' expected return on assets is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_17_ITEM15_P286_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P287_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities and is adjusted for the expected duration of the obligation and the funded status of the plan.
103730_17_ITEM15_P287_S1	At December 31, 2015, the Company's U.S. defined benefit plans were invested in diversified portfolios of fixed income securities and cash due to the pending termination and settlement of the plans.

103730_17_ITEM15_P288_S1	The Company's non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P288_S2	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_17_ITEM15_P288_S3	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P288_S4	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P288_S5	See Note 18 for further information on the fair value of the plan assets by asset category.
103730_17_ITEM15_P289_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:

103730_17_ITEM15_P298_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
103730_17_ITEM15_P299_S0	The impact of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation is not material.

103730_17_ITEM15_P301_S0	As the plans are unfunded, the Company's anticipated contributions for 2017 are equal to its estimated benefits payments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P302_S0	The Company participates in various other defined contribution and government-mandated retirement plans based on local law or custom.
103730_17_ITEM15_P302_S1	The Company periodically makes required contributions for certain of these plans, whereas other plans are unfunded retirement bonus plans which will be paid at the employee's retirement date.

103730_17_ITEM15_P304_S4	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_17_ITEM15_P304_S5	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.

103730_17_ITEM15_P305_S0	The Company has various stockholder-approved programs which allow for the grant of share-based compensation to officers, employees, and non-employee directors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P306_S0	The amount of compensation cost related to stock-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
103730_17_ITEM15_P306_S1	The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
103730_17_ITEM15_P307_S0	The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs"), phantom stock units, and restricted stock based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock adjusted for expected dividends paid over the required vesting period for non-participating awards.
103730_17_ITEM15_P307_S1	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.

103730_17_ITEM15_P320_S0	The 2007 Program authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to the extent provided for in the Company's employment agreements with certain executives.
103730_17_ITEM15_P320_S1	Each phantom stock unit entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock at the individual's termination of employment or any other future date specified in the applicable employment agreement.

103730_17_ITEM15_P327_S1	This amount changes based on changes in the market value of the Company's common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P327_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, 27,619 and 4,337 options were exercised, respectively.

103730_17_ITEM15_P332_S0	Complying with current laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.
103730_17_ITEM15_P333_S0	The Company has engaged environmental consultants and attorneys to assist management in evaluating potential liabilities related to environmental matters.
103730_17_ITEM15_P333_S1	Management assesses the input from these consultants along with other information known to the Company in its effort to continually monitor these potential liabilities.

103730_17_ITEM15_P337_S0	The Company is a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.

103730_17_ITEM15_P343_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues, a material portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, automotive, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P343_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_17_ITEM15_P343_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company's products, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
103730_17_ITEM15_P344_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues, certain subsidiaries and product lines have customers which comprise greater than 10% of the subsidiary's or product line's net revenues.
103730_17_ITEM15_P344_S1	The loss of one of these customers could have a material effect on the results of operations of the subsidiary or product line and financial position of the subsidiary, which could result in an impairment charge which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P345_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P345_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_17_ITEM15_P345_S2	As of December 31, 2016, one customer comprised 15.4% of the Company's accounts receivable balance.
103730_17_ITEM15_P345_S3	This customer comprised 14.6% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P345_S4	No other customer comprised greater than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P346_S0	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_17_ITEM15_P346_S1	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P347_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P347_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_17_ITEM15_P347_S2	As of December 31, 2016, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_17_ITEM15_P348_S0	Many of the Company's products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_17_ITEM15_P348_S1	The Company's consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_17_ITEM15_P348_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company's customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_17_ITEM15_P348_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net earnings.
103730_17_ITEM15_P349_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum.
103730_17_ITEM15_P350_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P350_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_17_ITEM15_P351_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_17_ITEM15_P351_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company's ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_17_ITEM15_P351_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company's ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company's products.
103730_17_ITEM15_P352_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_17_ITEM15_P352_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company's policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_17_ITEM15_P352_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P353_S0	Recently enacted rules in the U.S. on conflict minerals, which include tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold, all of which are used in the Company's products, could result in increased prices and decreased supply of conflict minerals, which could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P354_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 76% of revenues earned during 2016 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_17_ITEM15_P354_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, $1,084,453 of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by subsidiaries outside of the United States.
103730_17_ITEM15_P355_S0	Some of the Company's products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_17_ITEM15_P355_S1	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_17_ITEM15_P355_S2	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P356_S0	As of December 31, 2016 the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_17_ITEM15_P357_S0	Certain of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments deposited in U.S. financial institutions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P358_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 46 years.
103730_17_ITEM15_P358_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_17_ITEM15_P359_S0	Vishay is a global manufacturer and supplier of electronic components.
103730_17_ITEM15_P359_S1	Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_17_ITEM15_P359_S2	These segments represent groupings of product lines based on their functionality:
103730_17_ITEM15_P360_S0	Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ("MOSFETs") function as solid state switches to control power.
103730_17_ITEM15_P361_S0	Diodes route, regulate, and block radio frequency, analog, and power signals; protect systems from surges or electrostatic discharge damage; or provide electromagnetic interference filtering.
103730_17_ITEM15_P362_S0	Optoelectronic components emit light, detect light, or do both.
103730_17_ITEM15_P363_S0	Resistors and inductors both impede electric current.
103730_17_ITEM15_P364_S0	Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current.
103730_17_ITEM15_P365_S0	Inductors use an internal magnetic field to change alternating current phase and resist alternating current.
103730_17_ITEM15_P366_S0	Capacitors store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P367_S0	Vishay's reporting segments generate substantially all of their revenue from product sales to the industrial, automotive, telecommunications, computing, consumer products, power supplies, military and aerospace, and medical end markets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P367_S1	A small portion of revenues are from royalties.
103730_17_ITEM15_P368_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ("segment operating income").
103730_17_ITEM15_P368_S1	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_17_ITEM15_P368_S2	The Company's calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and other items.
103730_17_ITEM15_P368_S3	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_17_ITEM15_P368_S4	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_17_ITEM15_P369_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_17_ITEM15_P370_S0	The Company also regularly evaluates gross profit by segment to assist in the analysis of consolidated gross profit.
103730_17_ITEM15_P370_S1	The Company considers segment operating income to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business operations of the segments.
103730_17_ITEM15_P371_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_17_ITEM15_P372_S0	See Note 4 for restructuring and severance costs segment information.
103730_17_ITEM15_P373_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_17_ITEM15_P374_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_17_ITEM15_P375_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_17_ITEM15_P375_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_17_ITEM15_P376_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM15_P377_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_17_ITEM15_P378_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_17_ITEM15_P379_S0	The Company's convertible debt instruments are only convertible upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_17_ITEM15_P379_S1	The convertible debentures due 2042 are convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2016 evaluation of the conversion criteria.
103730_17_ITEM15_P379_S2	In periods that the debentures are not convertible, the certain conditions which could trigger conversion of the remaining debentures have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company has always assumed the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_17_ITEM15_P380_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_17_ITEM15_P380_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the "treasury stock method" (similar to options and warrants) rather than the "if converted method" otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_17_ITEM15_P380_S2	Under the "treasury stock method," Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the debentures based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_17_ITEM15_P380_S3	If the average market price is less than $13.14, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $18.00, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $11.17, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2042.
103730_17_ITEM15_P381_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_17_ITEM15_P382_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_17_ITEM15_P382_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_17_ITEM15_P382_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_17_ITEM15_P383_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_17_ITEM15_P384_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_17_ITEM15_P384_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_17_ITEM15_P385_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions.
103730_17_ITEM15_P386_S0	An asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_17_ITEM15_P387_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

103730_17_ITEM15_P394_S2	The fair value measurement of the exchange traded funds securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_17_ITEM15_P395_S0	The short-term investment fund strictly invests in short-term investments, including commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, U.S. government obligations, corporate notes, and funding agreements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P395_S1	The maturity date of all investments held by the short-term investment fund is within one year from the financial statement date.
103730_17_ITEM15_P395_S2	There are no redemption restrictions on the plan's investment.
103730_17_ITEM15_P396_S0	The fair value of the short-term investment fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investment.

103730_17_ITEM15_P400_S0	The Company holds available for sale investments in debt securities that are intended to fund a portion of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_17_ITEM15_P400_S1	The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_17_ITEM15_P400_S2	The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_17_ITEM15_P401_S0	The convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, issued by the Company on November 9, 2010, May 13, 2011, and May 31, 2012, respectively, contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period.
103730_17_ITEM15_P401_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_17_ITEM15_P402_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_17_ITEM15_P402_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company's current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures' credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_17_ITEM15_P402_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management's judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P403_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_17_ITEM15_P404_S0	The Company enters into forward contracts with highly-rated financial institutions to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.

103730_17_ITEM15_P404_S3	We have not designated the forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and as such the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_17_ITEM15_P404_S4	The Company estimates the fair value of the forward contracts based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using current market information and is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierachy.
103730_17_ITEM15_P404_S5	Due to the timing of the renewal of the forward contracts, the value of the forward contracts were immaterial as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
103730_17_ITEM15_P405_S0	The Company does not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_17_ITEM15_P406_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability and capitalized deferred financing costs, at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is approximately $860,600 and $756,900, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability and capitalized deferred financing costs, of $367,049 and $448,080, respectively.
103730_17_ITEM15_P406_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_17_ITEM15_P407_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
103730_17_ITEM15_P407_S1	The Company's short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
103730_17_ITEM15_P407_S2	The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P408_S0	At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary.
103730_17_ITEM15_P408_S1	No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented.
103730_17_ITEM15_P408_S2	There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification.
103730_17_ITEM15_P408_S3	All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities' maturity dates.

103730_17_ITEM15_P410_S2	Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_17_ITEM15_P411_S0	The Company's financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.
103730_17_ITEM15_P411_S1	The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported on the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values.
103730_17_ITEM15_P412_S0	On July 6, 2010, Vishay completed the spin-off of its measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. through a tax-free stock dividend to Vishay's stockholders.

103730_17_ITEM15_P413_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG is an independent company and Vishay retains no ownership interest.
103730_17_ITEM15_P414_S0	Following the spin-off, VPG and Vishay operate separately, each as independent public companies.
103730_17_ITEM15_P414_S1	Vishay has no ownership interest in VPG.
103730_17_ITEM15_P414_S2	However, Ruta Zandman solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman and Ziv Shoshani, all of whom are members of Vishay's Board of Directors, control a large portion of the voting power of both Vishay and VPG.
103730_17_ITEM15_P414_S3	Marc Zandman, Vishay's Executive Chairman of the Board and an executive officer of Vishay, serves as the Chairman of VPG.
103730_17_ITEM15_P414_S4	Ziv Shoshani, CEO of VPG, serves as a director of Vishay.
103730_17_ITEM15_P414_S5	Additionally, Timothy V. Talbert, a member of Vishay's Board of Directors is also a member of the Board of Directors of VPG.
103730_17_ITEM15_P415_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_17_ITEM15_P415_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_17_ITEM15_P415_S2	None of the agreements have had nor are expected to have a material impact on Vishay's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_17_ITEM15_P415_S3	Some of these agreements have expired and have not been renewed.
103730_17_ITEM15_P416_S0	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term "Vishay" in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay's product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_17_ITEM15_P416_S1	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_17_ITEM15_P417_S0	Until the spin-off, VPG was included in Vishay's consolidated federal income tax returns and with Vishay and/or certain of Vishay's subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.
103730_17_ITEM15_P417_S1	In conjunction with the spin-off, Vishay and VPG entered a tax matters agreement under which Vishay generally will be liable for all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes attributable to VPG with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the distribution date except to the extent that VPG has a liability for such taxes on its books at the time of the spin-off.
103730_17_ITEM15_P417_S2	Vishay is also principally responsible for managing any income tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions for pre-spin-off periods.
103730_17_ITEM15_P417_S3	Vishay has fully indemnified VPG of tax exposures arising prior to the spin-off.
103730_17_ITEM15_P418_S0	(a) May not add due to differences in weighted average share counts.
103730_17_ITEM15_P419_S0	(b) The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday, except for the first fiscal quarter, which always begins on January 1, and the fourth fiscal quarter, which always ends on December 31.

103730_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	Semiconductors include MOSFETs, diodes, and optoelectronic components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	Passive components include resistive products, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	Discrete semiconductors and passive components are essential elements of virtually every type of electronic circuit.
103730_18_ITEM1_P0_S4	They support the microprocessor chips and other integrated circuits ("ICs") that coordinate and control the functions of electronic devices and equipment.
103730_18_ITEM1_P0_S5	We offer our customers "one-stop shop" access to one of the most comprehensive electronic component product lines of any manufacturer in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
103730_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our semiconductor components are used for a wide variety of functions, including power control, power conversion, power management, signal switching, signal routing, signal blocking, signal amplification, two-way data transfer, one-way remote control, and circuit isolation.
103730_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our passive components are used to restrict current flow, suppress voltage increases, store and discharge energy, control alternating current ("AC") and voltage, filter out unwanted electrical signals, and perform other functions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our components are used in virtually every type of product that contains electronic circuitry, in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer, telecommunications, power supplies, military, aerospace, and medical markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	In the 1950's, the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's founder, was issued patents for his PhotoStress coatings and instruments, used to reveal and measure the distribution of stresses in structures such as airplanes and cars under live load conditions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	His research in this area led him to develop Bulk Metal foil resistors ultra-precise, ultra-stable resistors with performance far beyond any other resistor available to date.
103730_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	In 1962, Dr. Zandman, with a loan from the late Alfred P. Slaner, founded Vishay to develop and manufacture Bulk Metal foil resistors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Concurrently, J.E. Starr developed foil resistance strain gages, which also became part of Vishay.
103730_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	Throughout the 1960's and 1970's, Vishay established itself as a technical and market leader in foil resistors, PhotoStress products, and strain gages.
103730_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	These products were included with the measurements and foil resistor businesses that we spun off into an independent, publicly-traded company named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. ("Vishay Precision Group" or "VPG") through a tax-free stock dividend to our stockholders on July 6, 2010.
103730_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 1985, Vishay began to expand its product line through various strategic acquisitions, including the resistor companies Dale Electronics, Draloric Electronic, and Sfernice.
103730_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	In the early 1990's, Vishay applied its acquisition strategy to the capacitor market, with the major acquisitions of Sprague Electric, Roederstein, and Vitramon.
103730_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	In 2002, Vishay acquired BCcomponents, the former passive components business of Philips Electronics and Beyschlag, which greatly enhanced Vishay's global market position in passive components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	Over the years, we have made several smaller passive components acquisitions to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our product lines, or grow our high margin niche businesses.
103730_18_ITEM1_P4_S4	These include Electro-Films, Cera-Mite, and Spectrol in 2000; Tansitor and North American Capacitor Company (Mallory) in 2001; the thin film interconnect business of Aeroflex in 2004; Phoenix do Brasil in 2006; the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET Corporation in 2008; the resistor businesses of Huntington Electric in 2011; HiRel Systems in 2012; MCB Industrie in 2013; Holy Stone Polytech in 2014; and UltraSource in 2018.
103730_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	In the late 1990's, Vishay began expanding its product lines to include discrete semiconductors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	In 1998, Vishay acquired the Semiconductor Business Group of TEMIC, which included Telefunken and an 80.4% interest in Siliconix, producers of MOSFETs, RF transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, and power and analog switching integrated circuits.
103730_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Vishay's next semiconductor acquisition came in 2001, with the purchase of the infrared components business of Infineon Technologies, which was followed the same year by Vishay's acquisition of General Semiconductor, a leading global manufacturer of rectifiers and diodes.
103730_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	In 2005, Vishay made a successful tender offer for the minority interest in Siliconix.
103730_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	In 2007, Vishay acquired the Power Control Systems business of International Rectifier, further enhancing our product offerings.
103730_18_ITEM1_P7_S3	These acquisitions propelled Vishay into the top ranks of discrete semiconductor manufacturers.
103730_18_ITEM1_P7_S4	In 2014, Vishay increased its position in optoelectronic sensors through its acquisition of Capella, a fabless IC design company specializing in optoelectronic components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	We continue to implement the vision, strategy, and culture articulated by Dr. Zandman as we continue to work tirelessly to enhance value for our stockholders.
103730_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Vishay was incorporated in Delaware in 1962 and maintains its principal executive offices at 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355-2143.
103730_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our telephone number is (610) 644-1300.
103730_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	We were founded based on the inventions of Dr. Felix Zandman and we continue to emphasize technological innovation as a driver of growth.
103730_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	We are currently a worldwide technology and market leader in wirewound and other power resistors, leaded film resistors, thin film SMD resistors, wet and conformal-coated tantalum capacitors, capacitors for power electronics, power rectifiers, low-voltage power MOSFETs, and infrared components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	We maintain strategically placed application and product support centers where proximity to customers and our manufacturing locations enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	The breadth of our product portfolio along with the proximity of our field application engineers to customers provides increased opportunities to have our components selected and designed into new end products by customers in all relevant market segments.
103730_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We also maintain research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through accelerating the development of new products and technologies and increasing design-in opportunities by expanding our technical resources for providing solutions to customers.
103730_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	We are a leading manufacturer in our industry, with a broad product portfolio, access to a wide range of end markets and sales channels, and geographic diversity.
103730_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	We have solid, well-established relationships with our customers and strong distribution channels.
103730_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our senior management team is highly experienced, with deep industry knowledge.
103730_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	Over the past two decades, our management team has successfully restructured our company and integrated several acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	We can adapt our operations to changing economic conditions, as demonstrated by our ability to remain profitable and generate cash through the volatile economic cycle of the recent past.
103730_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We have one of the broadest product lines of discrete semiconductors and passive components among our competitors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our broad product portfolio allows us to penetrate markets in all industry segments and all regions, which reduces our exposure to a particular end market or geographic location.
103730_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through improving market penetration by expanding manufacturing facilities for our most successful products, increasing technical resources, and developing markets for specialty products in Asia.
103730_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our net revenues for the following applicable periods were attributable to customers in the following regions:
103730_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	The share of net revenues by end market was as follows:
103730_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Since 1985, we have expanded our product line through various strategic acquisitions, growing from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	We have successfully integrated the acquired companies within our existing management and operational structure, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales and administrative functions, creating manufacturing synergies, while improving customer service.
103730_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	We plan to grow our business and increase earnings per share, in part, through targeted acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	We have often targeted high margin niche business acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	We also target strategic acquisitions of businesses with technology and engineering capabilities that we can use to grow our business.
103730_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as "free cash" (see "Overview" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for "free cash" definition and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")).
103730_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Due to our strong operational management, cost control measures, efficient capital expenditures, broad product portfolio, and strong market position, we have generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 21 years and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 16 years.
103730_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	We expect the benefits of our restructuring and other cost cutting measures (see "Cost Management" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") to contribute to our "free cash" generation going forward.
103730_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2017, our cash and short-term investment balance exceeded our debt balance by $924.7 million.
103730_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also maintain a credit facility, which provides a revolving commitment of up to $640 million through December 10, 2020, of which $486.2 million was available as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our net cash position and short-term investment balance, available revolving commitment, and strong "free cash" flow generation provide financial strength and flexibility and reduce our exposure to future economic uncertainties.
103730_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the global economy and the local economies in which our customers operate.
103730_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by fluctuating consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	To continue to grow our business successfully, we need to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, modify existing products, respond to technological change, and customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have licenses to use, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of growth through acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	For this strategy to remain successful, we need to continue to identify attractive and available acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, and integrate new businesses, manufacturing processes, employees, and logistical arrangements into our existing management and operating infrastructure.
103730_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
103730_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Since our first acquisition in 1985, we have pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements:
103730_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	We plan to continue to use our research and development ("R D"), engineering, and product marketing resources to continually roll out new and innovative products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	As part of our plan to foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our worldwide R D and engineering technical staff, and increased our technical field sales force in Asia to increase opportunities to design-in our products in local markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our success.
103730_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop new innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products to make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends.
103730_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	We are directing increased funding and are focusing on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs.
103730_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We focus on controlling fixed costs and reducing variable costs.
103730_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	When our ongoing cost management activities are not adequate, we take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness including restructuring our business to improve efficiency and operating performance.

103730_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Passive components are used to store electrical charges, to limit or resist electrical current, and to help in filtering, surge suppression, measurement, timing, and tuning applications.
103730_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Resistors and inductors both impede electric current.
103730_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current.
103730_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Inductors use an internal magnetic field to change alternating current phase and resist alternating current.
103730_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our Resistors and Inductors business is our original business.
103730_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	We maintain the broadest portfolio of resistor products worldwide.
103730_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	Under current market conditions, the business is solid, predictable, and growing at relatively stable selling prices.

103730_18_ITEM1_P50_S5	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P50_S6	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Resistors vary widely in precision and cost, and are manufactured from numerous materials and in many forms.
103730_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Linear resistive components are classified as variable or fixed, depending on whether or not their resistance is adjustable.
103730_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Non-linear resistors function by varying in resistance under influence of temperature (thermistors) or voltage (varistors).
103730_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	They can be used in temperature-measuring applications or as current or voltage-limiting devices.
103730_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	We manufacture virtually all types of fixed resistors, both in discrete and network forms, as well as many variable types.
103730_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Vishay resistor innovations include Power Metal Strip technology.
103730_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	These resistors feature very low resistance and are used to measure changes in current flow (current sensing) or divert current flow (shunting).
103730_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Inductor applications include controlling AC current and voltage, filtering out unwanted electrical signals, and energy storage.
103730_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	Vishay inductor innovations include IHLP low-profile, high-current inductor technology with industry-leading specifications, which is patented and generates royalty revenue.
103730_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our low-profile, high-current inductors save circuit board space and power in voltage regulator module ("VRM") and DC to DC converter applications.
103730_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	In addition, we are a worldwide leader in custom magnetic solutions focusing on high performance and high reliability.
103730_18_ITEM1_P55_S4	This field has been substantially strengthened, with the 2012 acquisition of HiRel Systems, broadening our portfolio, customer, and market segment reach.
103730_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Capacitors store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our Capacitors business consists of a broad range of reliable, high-quality products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We have a strong presence worldwide in specialty markets based on our product performance and reliability and strong brand recognition (including our Sprague, Vitramon, Roederstein, BCcomponents, and ESTA brands).
103730_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	We focus on higher value markets in specialized industries, while maintaining a complete portfolio of commodity products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	We do not aim to be the volume leader in commodity markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	Capacitors are used in almost all electronic circuits.
103730_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	They store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Important applications for capacitors include electronic filtering for linear and switching power supplies; decoupling and bypass of electronic signals for integrated circuits and circuit boards; and frequency control, timing and conditioning of electronic signals for a broad range of applications.
103730_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	We manufacture products based on all major capacitor technologies: tantalum (molded chip tantalum, coated chip tantalum, solid through-hole tantalum, wet tantalum, and polymer), ceramic (multilayer chip and ceramic disc), film, power, heavy-current, and aluminum electrolytic.
103730_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our capacitors range from tiny surface-mount devices for hearing aids and mobile devices to large power correction capacitors used in renewable energy, heavy industry, and electrical power grids.
103730_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	We are a recognized technology leader in many product ranges, securing our strong position in military and medical markets, and in a wide range of industrial and automotive applications.
103730_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	Our wet tantalum and MicroTan technologies are market leaders.
103730_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by United States government agencies, and under certain European military specifications.
103730_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	Qualification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to the government agencies.
103730_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product's classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	During the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
103730_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	In order to better serve our customers, we maintain production facilities in locations where we market the bulk of our products, such as the United States, Germany, and Asia.
103730_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	To optimize production efficiencies, we have whenever practicable established manufacturing facilities in countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines, where we can benefit from lower labor and tax costs and also benefit from various government incentives, including grants and tax relief.
103730_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	One of our most sophisticated manufacturing operations is the production of power semiconductor components.
103730_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	This manufacturing process involves two phases of production: wafer fabrication and assembly (or packaging).
103730_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Wafer fabrication subjects silicon wafers to various thermal, metallurgical, and chemical process steps that change their electrical and physical properties.
103730_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	These process steps define cells or circuits within numerous individual devices (termed "dies" or "chips") on each wafer.
103730_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	Assembly is the sequence of production steps that divides the wafer into individual chips and encloses the chips in structures (termed "packages") that make them usable in a circuit.
103730_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	Both wafer fabrication and assembly phases incorporate wafer level and device level electrical testing to ensure that device design integrity has been achieved.
103730_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are located in California, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
103730_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	In Asia, our main manufacturing facilities are located in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, and Malaysia.
103730_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	In Europe, our main manufacturing facilities are located in Germany, France, and the Czech Republic.
103730_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	We have substantial manufacturing facilities in Israel.
103730_18_ITEM1_P66_S4	We also have manufacturing facilities in Austria, Dominican Republic, Japan, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, and the Philippines.
103730_18_ITEM1_P66_S5	Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase the efficiency of our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
103730_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	All of our manufacturing operations have received ISO 9001 certification.
103730_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Standards Organization.
103730_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area.
103730_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials, including plastics and metals, are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Certain materials, in addition to tantalum and including tin, tungsten, and gold are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers, the source for which may be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country.
103730_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	We are working toward the elimination of materials that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries from our supply chain.
103730_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications.
103730_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	We maintain an inventory of standardized components and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	They typically order products from us based on their forecasts.
103730_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	Therefore, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, which manufacture for OEMs on an outsourcing basis, and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to OEMs and EMS companies.
103730_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	The distribution of sales by customer type for 2017 is shown below:
103730_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our sales organizations are regionally based.
103730_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	While our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions, we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers' specific support requirements in each local area.
103730_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	The aim of our sales organizations is supporting our customers across all product lines, developing new design wins, negotiating contracts, and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi-national sales force.
103730_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have an established Strategic Global Account program, which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated Strategic Global Account Manager.
103730_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our Strategic Global Account Managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi-product business relationship.
103730_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	They typically coordinate the sales, pricing, contract, logistic, quality, and other aspects of the customer's business requirements.
103730_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Strategic Global Account Manager normally is the focal point of communication between Vishay and our main customers.
103730_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	We maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well.
103730_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	We work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development and to provide technical and applications support.
103730_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	In addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors, our Business Development group maintains teams of dedicated Field Application Engineers ("FAEs") to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific customer application needs using our entire product portfolio to provide support for our customers' engineering needs.
103730_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	Organized by market segment, our Business Development FAEs bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive, telecommunications, computer, consumer/entertainment, industrial, peripherals, digital consumer, and other market segments.
103730_18_ITEM1_P84_S3	With the ultimate goal of a Vishay "design-in" the process by which our customers specify a Vishay component in their products this program offers our customers enhanced access to all Vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins, and ultimately sales, for us.
103730_18_ITEM1_P84_S4	Most importantly, the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by our Business Development group.
103730_18_ITEM1_P84_S5	Our database captures specific design activities and allows for real-time measurement of new business potential for our management team.
103730_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our top 30 customers have been relatively stable despite not having long-term commitments to purchase our products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	With selected customers, we have signed longer term (greater than one year) contracts for specific products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	Net revenues from our top 30 customers represent approximately 70% of our total net revenues.
103730_18_ITEM1_P85_S3	No single customer comprises more than 10% of our total net revenues.
103730_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	In certain areas we also work with sales representatives.
103730_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	The commission expense for these sales representatives is not material.
103730_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	Many of our products and manufacturing techniques, technologies, and packaging methods have been invented, designed, and developed by Dr. Felix Zandman, our engineers, and our scientists.
103730_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	We maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets.
103730_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	These design centers are located predominantly in the United States, Germany, Italy, Israel, the People's Republic of China, France, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	We also employ research and development personnel and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products and to improve manufacturing processes and technologies.
103730_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	This decentralized system encourages product development at individual manufacturing facilities, closer to our customers.
103730_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	We face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers.

103730_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	Our sales and marketing programs aim to compete by offering our customers a broad range of world-class technologies and products, superior global sales and distribution support, and a secure and multi-location source of product supply.
103730_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	Recently there has been a considerable amount of consolidation activity in the electronic component industry, some of which involved our primary competitors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	We view the industry consolidation as an opportunity for us to gain business as an independent second-source supplier.
103730_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products.
103730_18_ITEM1_P98_S1	We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business.
103730_18_ITEM1_P98_S2	We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, continuing technological innovation, and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position.
103730_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have been licensed under, numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
103730_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
103730_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity's or individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
103730_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
103730_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business.
103730_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 23,000 full time employees, of whom approximately 91% were located outside the United States.
103730_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel.
103730_18_ITEM1_P104_S2	Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions, and employees at one U.S. facility are represented by a trade union.
103730_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	Our relationship with our employees is generally good.
103730_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	However, no assurance can be given that, if we continue to restructure our operations and/or reduce employee hours in response to changing economic conditions, labor unrest or strikes will not occur.
103730_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	We have adopted an Environmental Health and Safety Corporate Policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment, and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations.
103730_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	This policy is implemented with accountability directly to the Board of Directors.
103730_18_ITEM1_P106_S2	In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment.
103730_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	We are involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by us and our subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	We are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations.
103730_18_ITEM1_P110_S1	We continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
103730_18_ITEM1_P110_S2	While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy.
103730_18_ITEM1_P110_S3	More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with such regulations.
103730_18_ITEM1_P110_S4	Moreover, the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and, therefore, there can be no assurance that material environmental costs, including remediation costs, will not arise in the future.
103730_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	With each acquisition, we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize, or obtain indemnification for, the environmental matters we may be required to address.
103730_18_ITEM1_P111_S1	In addition, we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM1_P111_S2	We believe that the reserves we have established are adequate.
103730_18_ITEM1_P111_S3	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines.
103730_18_ITEM1_P111_S4	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
103730_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
103730_18_ITEM1_P112_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
103730_18_ITEM1_P112_S2	The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
103730_18_ITEM1_P112_S3	Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.
103730_18_ITEM1_P112_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
103730_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	In addition, our company website can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com.
103730_18_ITEM1_P113_S1	The website contains information about us and our operations.
103730_18_ITEM1_P113_S2	Copies of each of our filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, can be viewed and downloaded free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
103730_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	The following corporate governance related documents are also available on our website:
103730_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	Any of the above documents can also be obtained in print by any stockholder upon request to our Investor Relations Department at the following address:
103730_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	From time to time, information provided by us, including but not limited to statements in this report, or other statements made by or on our behalf, may contain "forward-looking" information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Such statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Set forth below are important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is cyclical and future periods of decline and recovery are not predictable.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The electronic component industry is highly cyclical and experiences periods of decline from time to time.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We and others in the electronic component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Market conditions, such as a decline in product demand on a global basis, could result in order cancellations and deferrals, lower average selling prices, and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	These declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end markets for our products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Changes in the demand mix, needed technologies, and these end markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	A slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations, and could adversely impact our results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring costs and associated asset write-downs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	To remain competitive, particularly when business conditions are difficult, we sometimes attempt to reduce our cost structure by restructuring our existing businesses, where we seek to achieve synergies, eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions, and move operations, where possible, to jurisdictions with lower labor costs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In 2013 and 2015, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The programs primarily focused on enhancing the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment, reducing selling, general, and administrative expenses company-wide, and improving the performance of certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In 2016, we announced an extension of the 2013 MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We incurred accelerated depreciation expenses related to assets that are no longer used after the implementation of the associated restructuring programs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The expenses associated with the programs were recorded as they become recognizable under GAAP.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	As of December 31, 2017, the programs were substantially implemented.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, our long-term strategy includes growing through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For this reason, we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is cyclical, and in periods of a rising economy we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If our restructuring activities result in us not being able to satisfy the intense demand from our customers during a rising economy and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These losses could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Despite our plan to continue to grow, in part, through targeted acquisitions, we may be unable to continue to identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are subject to various U.S. and foreign competition laws and regulations that may affect our ability to complete certain acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Also, if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated, cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, or we cannot effectively mitigate the assumed, contingent, and unknown liabilities acquired, our results of operations, financial condition, enterprise value, market value, and prospects could all be materially adversely affected.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we periodically invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, and their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Certain of our historical investments in start-up companies have not succeeded, and there can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, because we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	From time to time there have been short-term market shortages of certain raw materials used in our products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We cannot make any assurances that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for our products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	To assure availability of raw materials in times of shortage, we may enter into long-term supply contracts for these materials, which may prove costly, unnecessary, and burdensome when the shortage abates.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion of our facilities.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we are unable to meet our customers' requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede, resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	However, our applications may not result in issued patents.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Also, our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, design around our patented technologies, or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Also, the legal system in certain countries in which we operate may not provide or may not continue to provide sufficient, intellectual property legal protections and remedies.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is prevalent in the electronic components industry, particularly the discrete semiconductor sector.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing on patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Further, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement, or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	An unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We face intense competition in our business, and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our business is highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery, and price.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than us, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years, and as a result, their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	This trend has adversely affected our average selling prices, particularly for commodity components.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when demand exceeds global supply.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	They often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately reflects the level of orders that we will ultimately deliver.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase our costs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Nevertheless, we have in the past and may in the future inherit certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines, or otherwise incur environmental liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are involved in remediation programs and related litigation at various current and former properties and at third-party disposal sites both within and outside of the U.S., including involvement as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition, future developments, including related to our remediation programs, or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In order to resolve liabilities at various sites, we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees, some of which may be, under certain conditions, reopened or subject to renegotiation.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our products are sold to or used in goods sold to the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	By virtue of such sales, we are subject to various regulatory requirements and risks in the event of non-compliance.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We sell products under prime and subprime contracts with the U.S. government and other governments.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Many of these products are used in military applications.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	These requirements, although customary in government contracts, impact our performance and compliance costs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records and the recording of costs, and foreign corruption.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The termination of a government contract as a result of any of these acts could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Electronic Supply Center and under certain European military specifications.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These products are assigned certain classification levels.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In order to maintain the classification level of a product, we must continuously perform tests on the products and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If a product fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level, its classification may be reduced to a lower level.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	A decrease in the classification level for a product with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Rapid changes in technologies, frequent new product introductions, and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop and manufacture products that feature technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, auditing, and treasury.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	While we have employment agreements with certain of our executives, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Any significant system or network disruption, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Such network disruption could result in a loss of the confidentiality of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or customer or employee personal data.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	We have implemented protective measures to prevent against and limit the effects of system or network disruptions, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future disruptions and any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Third-party service providers, such as foundries, subcontractors, distributors, and vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold, security breaches and loss of our data could result.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Significant fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our credit facility bears interest at variable rates based on LIBOR.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our interest expense.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	A general increase in interest rates would be largely offset by an increase in interest income earned on our cash and short-term investment balances, which are currently greater than our debt balances.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	However, there can be no assurance that the interest rate earned on cash and short-term investments will move in tandem with the interest rate paid on our variable rate debt.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our debt levels have increased and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The recorded value of our outstanding debt increased from approximately $347 million as of December 31, 2008 to approximately $370 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to the issuance of convertible senior debentures, the proceeds from the sale of which we used to fund repurchases of our common stock.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The carrying value of our convertible senior debentures will continue to increase as the discount associated with the debentures is amortized.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Additionally, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the conditions contained in our existing debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Prior to three months before the respective maturity dates of our convertible senior debentures due 2040, 2041, and 2042, the holders of the debentures may only convert the debentures under specific circumstances as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2017, our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and 2042 are convertible (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
103730_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Regardless of current convertibility of the debentures, GAAP requires convertible debentures to be included in the calculation of diluted EPS using either the "If Converted" or the "Treasury Stock Method" depending on our intent and ability to settle the debentures upon repurchase or conversion.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Pursuant to the indentures governing the respective debentures, we have the right to pay the conversion value or purchase price for the debentures in cash, Vishay common stock, or a combination of both.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the debentures and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted EPS computation using the "Treasury Stock" method" rather than the "If Converted" method.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If we were unable to employ the "Treasury Stock" method due to increased debt levels or changes in intentions, the number of potentially dilutive securities could increase significantly.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our existing credit facility restricts our current and future operations and requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our existing credit facility includes restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, making asset sales, and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our existing credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we are not in compliance with all of such covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Additionally, our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain the lenders' consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We cannot make any assurances that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we were to undertake an acquisition for equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We have substantial operations outside the United States, and approximately 77% of our revenues during 2017 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Certain of our assets are located, and certain of our products are produced, in countries which are subject to risks of social, political, economic, and military instability.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuation, and labor unrest.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to access our liquidity.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business has been in operation in Israel for 47 years, where we have substantial manufacturing operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Although we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars, our financial condition and results of operations might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our global operations are subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and other regulations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations or violations under other regulations relating to limitations on or licenses required for sales made to customers located in certain countries.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We attempt to improve profitability by controlling labor costs, but these activities could result in labor unrest or considerable expense.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Historically, our primary labor cost controlling strategy was to transfer manufacturing operations to countries with lower production costs, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Philippines.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We do not anticipate further transferring any significant existing operations to lower-labor-cost countries; however, acquired operations may be transferred to lower-labor-cost countries when integrated into Vishay.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Currently, our primary labor cost controlling strategy involves reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries when demand for our products decreases.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Shifting operations to lower-labor-cost countries, reducing hours, or limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs, and/or strikes or other types of labor unrest.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	From time to time, we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P62_S5	This is particularly the case for products produced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Approximately 99% of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances were held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our U.S. parent company and U.S. subsidiaries have significant payment obligations.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2017, $1,282.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by subsidiaries outside of the United States.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), enacted on December 22, 2017, transitions the U.S. from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Under previous law, companies could indefinitely defer U.S. income taxation on unremitted foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The TCJA imposes a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings of 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets, payable in defined increments over eight years.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	As a result of this requirement, we provisionally expect to pay $180.0 million, net of estimated applicable foreign tax credits, and after utilization of net operating loss and R D and FTC Credit carryforwards.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Based on our U.S. cash position, we expect that we will be required to repatriate amounts from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States to satisfy this tax obligation.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	These previously deferred foreign earnings may now be repatriated to the United States without additional U.S. federal taxation.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	However, any such repatriation could incur withholding and other foreign taxes in the source and intervening foreign jurisdictions, and certain U.S. state taxes.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and principal and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If we are unable to repatriate adequate cash to the United States to satisfy these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations and our liquidity.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The holders of our Class B common stock have effective voting control of our company.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B common stock.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	At December 31, 2017, the holders of Class B common stock held approximately 47.9% of the voting power of Vishay.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P72_S3	The ownership of Class B common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P72_S4	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors), approximately 89.5% of our Class B common stock and 42.9% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We have a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of Vishay difficult.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Along with the Class B common stock voting power, our staggered board of directors might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Also, as a consequence of our staggered board, directors may not be removed without cause, even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our overall long-term business strategy has historically included a strong focus on acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand, the incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of equity, directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that, because of their size and our financial condition at the time, would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Some or all of our holders of Class B common stock may exert considerable influence over our policies, business and affairs, and in any corporate transaction or other matter, including those described above.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	If such opportunities were to arise, our Board of Directors may consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders, including our Class B stockholders.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Any resulting reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our outstanding convertible debentures may impact the trading price of our common stock.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We believe that many investors in, and potential purchasers of, convertible debt instruments employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to these instruments.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to convertible debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the convertible instrument and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the instrument.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The implementation of this strategy by investors in our convertible debentures, as well as related market regulatory actions, could have a significant impact on the trading prices of our common stock, and the trading prices and liquidity of our convertible debentures.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P78_S3	The price of our common stock and our convertible debentures could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible debentures as more attractive means of equity participation in us.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Vishay Precision Group is using the Vishay name under license from us, which could result in product and market confusion or the loss of certain of our rights to the Vishay name .
103730_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	VPG has a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from us to use the "Vishay" mark as part of its corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of the products and services that comprise its measurements and foil resistors businesses.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The license of the Vishay name to VPG is important because we anticipate that the success of VPG will depend in no small measure on the reputation of the Vishay brand for these products and services built over many years.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Nonetheless, there exists the risk that the use by VPG could cause confusion in the marketplace over the products of the two companies, that any negative publicity associated with a product or service of VPG following the spin-off could be mistakenly attributed to our company or that we could lose our own rights to the "Vishay" mark if we fail to impose sufficient controls on VPG's use of the mark.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	In addition to the risks relating specifically to our business, a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our common stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in price and volume.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component industry could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new factors emerge from time to time.
103730_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2017, our business had 48 manufacturing locations.
103730_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our manufacturing facilities include owned and leased locations.
103730_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some locations include both owned and leased facilities in the same location.
103730_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	The list of manufacturing facilities below excludes manufacturing facilities that are presently idle due to our restructuring activities.
103730_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management, our properties and equipment generally are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs.
103730_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	Owning many of our manufacturing facilities provides us meaningful financial and operating benefits, including long-term stability and a necessary buffer for economic downturns.
103730_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.
103730_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	The principal locations of our owned manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	The principal locations of our leased manufacturing facilities, along with available space including administrative offices, are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business.
103730_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	Management believes that such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
103730_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	Vishay Polytech Co., Ltd. ("VPC"), a subsidiary of Vishay which was purchased from Holy Stone Enterprises Co., Ltd. ("Holy Stone") in June 2014, is a named defendant, among other manufacturers, in purported antitrust class action complaints in the United States and Canada.
103730_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaints allege restraints of trade in aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors, and in some cases, film capacitors, and seek injunctive relief and unspecified joint and several treble damages.
103730_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. is a party to similar cases filed in Canada.
103730_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	Holy Stone has agreed to indemnify Vishay and VPC for losses, including penalties and expenses associated with the litigation and investigation described above.
103730_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	Notwithstanding this indemnity obligation, the Company and VPC intend to defend vigorously against the civil complaints.
103730_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	We are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues.
103730_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	In addition, we have observed that in the current business environment, electronic component and semiconductor companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors.
103730_18_ITEM3_P3_S2	We are a party to disputes alleging infringement of third-party patents.
103730_18_ITEM3_P3_S3	When we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights, we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action, and we intend to continue to do so.
103730_18_ITEM3_P4_S0	Vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by Vishay and its subsidiaries both within and outside of the U.S., in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at Superfund sites.
103730_18_ITEM3_P5_S0	Certain obligations as a PRP have arisen in connection with business acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM3_P6_S0	The remediation programs are on-going and the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
103730_18_ITEM3_P6_S1	See also Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of February 16, 2018:
103730_18_ITEM4_P1_S0	Executive Chairman of the Board, Chief Business Development Officer, and President, Vishay Israel Ltd.
103730_18_ITEM4_P2_S0	* Member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.

103730_18_ITEM4_P3_S3	Mr. Zandman was Group Vice President of Vishay Measurements Group from 2002 to 2004.
103730_18_ITEM4_P3_S4	Mr. Zandman has served in various other capacities with Vishay since 1984.
103730_18_ITEM4_P4_S0	He is the son of the late Dr. Felix Zandman, Vishay's Founder.
103730_18_ITEM4_P4_S1	Mr. Zandman controls, on a shared basis with Ruta Zandman and Ziv Shoshani, approximately 34.0% of the total voting power of our capital stock as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM4_P4_S2	He also is non-executive Chairman of Vishay Precision Group, Inc., an independent, publicly-traded company spun-off from Vishay Intertechnology in 2010.
103730_18_ITEM4_P5_S0	Dr. Gerald Paul was appointed Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2005.
103730_18_ITEM4_P5_S1	Dr. Paul has served as a Director of the Company since 1993, and has been President of the Company since March 1998.

103730_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	Holders of record of our common stock totaled approximately 1,000 at February 14, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these stockholders of record.
103730_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	In 2014, the Company's Board of Directors instituted a quarterly cash dividend program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	Cash dividends of $0.0625 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid in each fiscal quarter of 2016 and the first three fiscal quarters of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	Cash dividends of $0.0675 per share of common stock and Class B common stock were paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although the amount and timing of any future dividends remains subject to authorization of our Board of Directors.
103730_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table sets forth, for the indicated periods, the high and low sales prices of our common stock and the quarterly cash dividends declared.
103730_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	At February 14, 2018, we had outstanding 12,097,427 shares of Class B common stock, par value $.10 per share, each of which entitles the holder to ten votes.
103730_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Class B common stock generally is not transferable except in certain very limited instances, and there is no market for those shares.
103730_18_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Class B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock on a share for share basis.
103730_18_ITEM5_P5_S2	As a result of the passing of our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman, Mrs. Ruta Zandman (a member of our Board of Directors) controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Executive Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (a member of our Board of Directors) approximately 89.7% of our Class B common stock and 43.0% of the total voting power of our capital stock.

103730_18_ITEM5_P7_S2	The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at our direction in accordance with the plan.
103730_18_ITEM5_P7_S3	The following table provides information about repurchases of the Company's common stock during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017:

103730_18_ITEM5_P8_S1	The line graph assumes that $100 had been invested at December 31, 2012 and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
103730_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

103730_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	These items are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	Includes the results of Holy Stone Polytech, from June 11, 2014, and the results of Capella from September 1, 2014, including the noncontrolling interest for the period before full control was obtained.
103730_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	Also includes $20,897,000 of restructuring and severance costs, $15,588,000 of U.S. pension plan non-cash settlement charges, a $25,706,000 tax expense related to a planned repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States, a $25,706,000 tax benefit due to the effects of changes in uncertain tax positions, and a $1,228,000 one-time tax benefit related to tax law changes.

103730_18_ITEM6_P5_S2	These items, net of their related tax consequences, had a positive $0.02 effect on earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders.
103730_18_ITEM6_P6_S0	Management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, restructuring and severance costs, material pension settlement charges, executive compensation charges (credits), material gains and losses on sales of property, special tax items, and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.

103730_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	We operate in five product segments, MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
103730_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition to our growth plan, we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	In 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase our ability to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	On August 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $150 million of our outstanding common stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	The stock repurchase plan will expire on June 1, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S6	The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at any time at the Company's direction in accordance with the plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S7	The Company repurchased 2,250,236 shares of stock for $39.9 million since the inception of this plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P3_S8	Additionally, we repurchased 1,752,454 shares of stock for $23.2 million pursuant to our stock repurchase plan that began in May 2016 and expired on May 2, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	As a result of that evaluation, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax expense of $164.0 million, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings which we expect to repatriate to the U.S. over the next several years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	We repatriated $38 million and $46 million to the U.S. pursuant to this plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	This 2015 repatriation program was expected to occur over a multiple-year period in the most tax-efficient manner, considering U.S. tax laws and the impact of withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions, and was designed to be adaptable to the extent necessary or prudent, based on changes in law, tax rates, or other regulations.
103730_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), and as further described below, we have terminated the 2015 cash repatriation plan and replaced it as described below.
103730_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	In the first fiscal quarter of 2016, we substantially completed the implementation of targeted cost reduction programs that began in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, we substantially completed the cost reduction programs initiated in 2015 and the extended MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program, which we announced in November 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	Our cost reduction programs are more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and in "Cost Management" below.
103730_18_ITEM7_P6_S6	See additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in Part 1.
103730_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The TCJA represents the first significant change in U.S. tax law in over 30 years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	No. 118, the net tax expense recorded in our financial statements for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the TCJA is considered "provisional," based on reasonable estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	The net tax expense recorded was $234.9 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	We are continuing to collect and analyze detailed information that could impact this amount, and may record adjustments to refine those estimates during the measurement period defined in SAB No. 118, as additional analysis is completed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We recorded noncash intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $57.6 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $5.4 million in 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	The goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We own and operate a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	As more fully described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded a loss of $5.4 million related to this incident in 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	The temporary shutdown adversely impacted revenues and margins of our Diodes segment (and total Vishay) for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	We received insurance payments totaling $13.4 million and recognized a gain of $8.8 million related to this incident and the insurance proceeds received in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	In December 2016, we completed the termination and settlement of our qualified U.S. pension plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The settlement resulted in a non-cash pre-tax charge of $79.3 million to recognize the unrecognized actuarial items related to the pension plan recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
103730_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	The pension plan termination and settlement is more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	We experienced a continued high level of demand in virtually all end-markets in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Net revenues decreased slightly versus the prior fiscal quarter, but remained significantly higher than the prior year quarter.
103730_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	Net revenues for 2017 increased significantly versus 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	The strong order levels of 2017 continued in the fourth fiscal quarter and resulted in continued strong metrics and an increase in nearly all key financial metrics compared to the prior year quarter.
103730_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.604 billion, compared to net revenues of $2.323 billion and $2.300 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.3 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $48.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016, and net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders of $108.5 million, or $0.73 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted for various items that management believes are not indicative of the intrinsic operating performance of our business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We define free cash as the cash flows generated from continuing operations less capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
103730_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash do not have uniform definitions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
103730_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net earnings (loss) attributable to Vishay stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 include items affecting comparability.
103730_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	* Includes add-back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive.
103730_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP.
103730_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	** Results have been recast due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.
103730_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our results for 2016 and 2017 represent the effects of an excellent business environment, a high level of orders, our cost reduction programs, and our organic growth initiatives.
103730_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Order activity was already strong in 2016, but we experienced a relatively sharp upturn in demand in the first half of 2017 that continued through the second half of the year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Our percentage of euro-based sales approximates our percentage of euro-based expenses so the foreign currency impact on revenues was substantially offset by the impact on expenses.
103730_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our pre-tax results were consistent with expectations based on our business model.
103730_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	We utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	We also monitor changes in our inventory turnover and our or publicly available average selling prices ("ASP").
103730_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold, but also deducts certain other period costs, particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Losses on purchase commitments and inventory write-downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge, but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used.
103730_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
103730_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gain or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues, but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
103730_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	If demand falls below customers' forecasts, or if customers do not control their inventory effectively, they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty.
103730_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
103730_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	An important indicator of demand in our industry is the book-to-bill ratio, which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
103730_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
103730_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
103730_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Pricing in our industry can be volatile.
103730_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Using our and publicly available data, we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing.
103730_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
103730_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	We attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
103730_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	All pricing is subject to governing market conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	(1) Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 and the first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017 includes $7.1 million, $1.5 million, $0.5 million, $3.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, of restructuring and severance expenses (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Operating margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 includes $79.3 million of pension settlement charges (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).
103730_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	See "Financial Metrics by Segment" below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 decreased slightly versus the third fiscal quarter of 2017, but increased significantly versus the prior year quarter.
103730_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The continued strong demand further increased the backlog and the book-to-bill ratio.
103730_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	Distributors continue to drive the high order rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	We keep increasing manufacturing capacities and output of our key product lines, but the high order rates have increased product delivery leadtimes and even caused some shortages of supply.
103730_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	Many of our product lines are operating at or near capacity.
103730_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	Sequentially, average selling prices were virtually stable, reflective of the strong business environment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Gross profit margin decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter, but increased versus the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The fluctuations are primarily volume-driven with decreasing average selling prices burdening each period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.28 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from 1.11 in the third fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The book-to-bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 1.40 and 1.13, respectively, versus ratios of 1.15 and 1.06, respectively, during the third fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 (dollars in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted in the United States.
103730_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The TCJA represents sweeping changes in U.S. tax law.
103730_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Under U.S. GAAP (specifically, ASC Topic 740), the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.
103730_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The total effect of tax law changes on deferred tax balances is recorded as a component of income tax expense.
103730_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	In response to the TCJA, the Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB No. 118") to provide guidance to registrants in applying ASC Topic 740 in connection with the TCJA.
103730_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	SAB No. 118 provides that in the period of enactment, the income tax effects of the TCJA may be reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate (to the extent a reasonable estimate can be determined), which would be subject to adjustment during a "measurement period".
103730_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	The measurement period begins in the reporting period of the TCJA's enactment and ends when a registrant has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740.
103730_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	SAB No. 118 also describes supplemental disclosures that should accompany the provisional amounts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The TCJA represents the first significant change in U.S. tax law in over 30 years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	As permitted by SAB No. 118, the net tax expense recorded in our financial statements for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the TCJA is considered "provisional," based on reasonable estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	We are continuing to collect and analyze detailed information about the earnings and profits of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, the related taxes paid, the amounts which could be repatriated, the foreign taxes which may be incurred on repatriation, and the associated impact of these items under the TCJA.
103730_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	We may record adjustments to refine those estimates during the measurement period, as additional analysis is completed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	Furthermore, we are continuing to evaluate the TCJA's provisions and may prospectively adjust our financial structure and business practices accordingly.
103730_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The provisional amount of net tax expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 that is directly and indirectly related to the TCJA is summarized as follows (amounts in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	As a result of the TCJA, we recognized a provisional tax benefit of $74.8 million to remeasure our net deferred tax liabilities at the lower, 21% rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The TCJA transitions the U.S. from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.
103730_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Under previous law, companies could indefinitely defer U.S. income taxation on unremitted foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The TCJA imposes a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings of 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets, payable in defined increments over eight years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	As a result of this requirement, we recognized provisional tax expense of $215.6 million, and provisionally expect to pay $180.0 million, net of estimated applicable foreign tax credits, and after utilization of net operating loss and R D and FTC Credit carryforwards.
103730_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	These previously deferred foreign earnings may now be repatriated to the United States without additional U.S. federal taxation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	However, any such repatriation could incur withholding and other foreign taxes in the source and intervening foreign jurisdictions, and certain U.S. state taxes.
103730_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Due to the changes in taxation of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and also because of the need to finance the payment of the transition tax, we made the determination during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 that certain unremitted foreign earnings in Israel, Germany, Austria, and France are no longer permanently reinvested, and have recorded provisional tax expense of $213.0 million to accrue the incremental foreign income taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions assuming the hypothetical repatriation to the United States of these approximately $1.1 billion of available foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Due to the existence of the foreign cash taxes payable at the source, we expect to actually repatriate these amounts at a measured pace over several years, and may decide to ultimately not repatriate some of these amounts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	There are additional amounts of unremitted foreign earnings in other countries, which continue to be reinvested indefinitely, and we have made no provision for incremental foreign income taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions related to these amounts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred foreign tax liability for these amounts is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we recognized income tax, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300 million of foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	This tax expense was recognized in 2015 following an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that could be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	We repatriated $38.0 million and $46.0 million pursuant to this program in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, the related deferred tax liability for the 2015 repatriation plan was $118.9 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	We have terminated the 2015 cash repatriation plan and recorded a provisional income tax benefit to reverse this deferred tax liability, which was replaced by the liability for the transition tax and foreign income and withholding taxes described above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	The deferred tax liability related to these unremitted foreign earnings is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each balance sheet date.
103730_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	Changes in these underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.
103730_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	We expect to continue to generate a significant amount of cash and profits from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our provision for income taxes will continue to be based on various assertions regarding the future use of that cash and profits.
103730_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Such assertions require us to consider a wide variety of U.S. federal and foreign tax laws, and the application of such laws to our operational and strategic needs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our GAAP interest expense generally exceeds our U.S.-based operating income, resulting in pre-tax losses in the U.S.
103730_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Accordingly, we have historically recorded U.S. federal tax benefits, at 35%, which had the effect of reducing our consolidated GAAP tax rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	Accordingly, the reduction in the statutory U.S. tax rate will generally increase our consolidated GAAP tax rate due to the loss of these tax benefits recognized on a GAAP basis.
103730_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The TCJA expands the U.S. current taxation of foreign earned income beginning in 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") is income of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that exceeds an allowable return and which will then be included in U.S. current taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and possibly reduced by indirect foreign tax credits.
103730_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	We have elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore have not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	We expect that we will be subject to incremental U.S. tax on GILTI income beginning in 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	Because of the complexity of the new GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating the impact on our future effective tax rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The TCJA also imposes a base erosion and anti-abuse minimum tax ("BEAT").
103730_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	BEAT could potentially increase our U.S. federal income tax by disallowing certain otherwise deductible payments from the U.S. to non-U.S. subsidiaries and imposing a minimum tax if greater than the regular tax.
103730_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	We are still evaluating the potential impacts of the new BEAT tax rules.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We historically derived significant cash tax savings from our convertible debentures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the interest deduction for the convertible debentures is computed based on the comparable yield of a hypothetical fixed rate debt instrument with similar terms and conditions but no conversion feature.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	Accordingly, annual interest deductions are calculated at 8.0%, 8.375%, and 7.5% of the adjusted issue price.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S3	The adjusted issue price, and consequently the interest deduction for income tax purposes, grows over the term of the debt due to the difference between the interest deduction using a comparable yield applied to the adjusted issue price, and the coupon rate of 2.5% on the principal amount.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S4	Interest expense recognized in accordance with GAAP is calculated at the comparable yield multiplied by the carrying amount of the liability component of convertible debentures, which is substantially lower than the adjusted issue price for tax purposes.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S5	The difference between the tax and GAAP interest computations resulted in substantially greater interest deductions for tax purposes than GAAP interest expense.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S6	The TCJA limits deduction for net interest expense, which makes the convertible debentures less attractive financial instruments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S7	While the convertible debentures due 2040 and 2042 and currently convertible at the option of the holders, none of the convertible debentures are currently callable by us.
103730_18_ITEM7_P60_S8	We are evaluating financing alternatives, which might include the modification or replacement of such instruments, as a result of the TCJA.
103730_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	This includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share, penetrate different geographic markets, enhance new product development, round out our existing product lines, or grow our high margin niche market businesses.
103730_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
103730_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	To limit our financial exposure, we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post-acquisition debt would exceed 2.5x our pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA").
103730_18_ITEM7_P61_S4	For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay's four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our growth plan targets adding, through acquisitions, an average of approximately $100 million of revenues per year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Depending on the opportunities available, we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	We intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash, rather than debt or equity, although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary.
103730_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	We are not currently targeting acquisitions with a purchase price larger than $500 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	There is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable.
103730_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, we deposited the $6.8 million purchase price of Sonntag Electronic GmbH ("Sonntag").
103730_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	The acquisition was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Sonntag is a distributor of electronic components in Germany.
103730_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	On February 8, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of UltraSource, Inc., a U.S.-based, privately-held thin film circuit and thin film interconnect manufacturer, for $13.4 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	This business will be incorporated into our Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs, and use various measures and metrics to evaluate our cost structure.
103730_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	We define variable costs as expenses that vary with respect to quantity produced.
103730_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Fixed costs do not vary with respect to quantity produced over the relevant time period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Contributive margin is calculated as net revenue less variable costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	It may be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of net revenue.
103730_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	Management uses this measure to determine the amount of profit to be expected for any change in revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	While these measures are typical cost accounting measures, none of these measures are recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The classification of expenses as either variable or fixed is judgmental and other companies might classify such expenses differently.
103730_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	We closely monitor variable costs and seek to achieve the contributive margin in our business model.
103730_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Over a period of many years, we have generally maintained a contributive margin of between 45% - 47% of revenues.
103730_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	The erosion of average selling prices, particularly of our semiconductor products, that is typical of our industry, and inflation negatively impact contributive margin and drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	Our variable cost reduction efforts include increasing the efficiency in our production facilities by expending capital for automation, reducing materials costs, materials substitution, increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes, and other yield improvement activities.
103730_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs recorded as costs of products sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses and maintaining our break-even point (adjusted for acquisitions).
103730_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	We seek to limit increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses to the rate of inflation, excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes.
103730_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	At constant fixed costs, we would expect each $1 million increase in revenues to increase our operating income by approximately $450,000 to $470,000.
103730_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	Sudden changes in the business conditions, however, may not allow us to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity and cost structure.
103730_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Occasionally, our ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate and we must take actions to maintain our cost competitiveness.
103730_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	We incurred significant restructuring expenses in our past to reduce our cost structure.
103730_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	We believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets, while maintaining lower manufacturing costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	Since 2013, our cost reduction programs have primarily focused on reducing fixed costs, including selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, we announced various cost reduction programs as part of our continuous efforts to improve efficiency and operating performance.
103730_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	The programs initiated in 2013 primarily focused on a plan to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and a voluntary separation / early retirement offer to certain employees Company-wide.
103730_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	We also implemented two other smaller cost reduction programs concerning the manufacturing of products within our Diodes segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	The voluntary separation / early retirement and Diodes segment programs were substantially completed in 2014.
103730_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	We completed the initially planned production transfer as part of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program in the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The production transfer occurred over a period of approximately two years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	The manufacture of wafers for certain critical products was transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	As a consequence, certain other wafer manufacturing previously occurring in-house was transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P77_S4	We incurred other exit costs associated with the production transfer, including certain contract termination costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	The initially-planned production transfer achieved the expected improvement in contributive margin percentage and fixed cost reduction; however, as a result of a decrease in net revenues since the plan was first initiated, gross margin for the MOSFETs segment remained below 20%.
103730_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	As a result of a review of the financial results and outlook for the MOSFETs segment following the completion of production transfers, in November 2016, we determined to implement further cost reductions for the MOSFETs segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	In November 2016, we announced an extension of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The extended program included various cost reduction initiatives, primarily the transfer of all remaining manufacturing operations at our Santa Clara, California facility to other Vishay facilities or third-party subcontractors.
103730_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	We incurred cash charges of $7.2 million, primarily related to severance, to implement these additional steps.
103730_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	We expect to realize annualized savings of approximately $8 million to $9 million as a result of these additional initiatives.
103730_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	These savings were largely achieved by the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	We will maintain our R D and management presence in the Silicon Valley area, and expect to move into a new R D facility in San Jose in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program is substantially completed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	We recorded $3.2 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2017 for the expenses that were recognizable under GAAP in 2017 and $26.7 million of total restructuring and severance expenses to implement the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	As a result of our cost reduction activities in our MOSFETs segment, we have established a solid and competitive cost basis for future growth.
103730_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	Segment gross profit margin has improved to acceptable levels beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2017 (which also reflects higher revenues).
103730_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Programs were also initiated in 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The programs initiated in 2015 included a plan to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and targeted streamlining and consolidation of production for certain product lines within our Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	The implementation of these programs did not impact planned R D activities, or our growth initiatives in Asian markets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	As of December 31, 2017, these programs have been substantially implemented.
103730_18_ITEM7_P84_S4	The programs in total are expected to lower costs by approximately $35 million annually (at current volumes).
103730_18_ITEM7_P84_S5	We recorded $8.1 million of restructuring and severance expenses in 2017 for expenses that were recognizable under GAAP in 2017 and $31.7 million of total restructuring and severance expenses to implement these programs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	The programs announced in 2015 have reduced selling, general, and administrative costs by approximately $17 million annually.
103730_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	These selling, general, and administrative cost reductions were substantially implemented by the end of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	We first solicited volunteers to accept a voluntary separation / early retirement offer.
103730_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	The voluntary separation benefits vary by country and job classification, but generally offer a cash loyalty bonus.
103730_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	Additional involuntary terminations were necessary to achieve the cost reduction targets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	We began to realize cost savings as a result of these programs in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	The targeted plans to streamline and consolidate production of certain product lines are expected to decrease costs of products sold by approximately $18 million annually (at current volumes).
103730_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	These plans include the Zwolle, Netherlands aluminum capacitors facility closure announced on June 30, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	We do not anticipate any material restructuring activities in 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	We believe that we can substantially maintain our trained workforce, even at lower manufacturing activity levels, by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	However, a sluggish business environment for the electronics industry or the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives.
103730_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our long-term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses, and GAAP requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, as such expenses are incurred.
103730_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to any of the businesses acquired since 2011, but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Even as we seek to manage our costs, we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	We plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	To foster intensified internal growth, we have increased our worldwide R D and engineering technical staff; we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities; we are increasing our technical field sales force in Asia to increase our market access to the industrial segment and increase the design-in of our products in local markets; and we are directing increased funding and focus on developing products to capitalize on the connectivity, mobility, and sustainability growth drivers of our business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S3	These efforts as well as our broad and innovative product portfolio and strong position in distribution worldwide have us positioned very well in case of a dramatic upturn in the economy.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S4	Our growth plan also targets adding, through acquisitions, $100 million of revenues per year on average.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S5	Since 2011, we have acquired the specialty product businesses of Huntington Electric, HiRel Systems, LLC, MCB Industrie, and UltraSource.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S6	In 2014, we made strategic acquisitions of Holy Stone Polytech and Capella and plan to use the technology and engineering capabilities acquired to further grow our business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P91_S7	We continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities.
103730_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our goodwill impairment tests.
103730_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.4 million to write-off the goodwill balance of our Capacitors reporting unit as a result of these tests.
103730_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	The interim impairment test performed as of October 3, 2015, the last day of the third fiscal quarter, was effectively the annual impairment test for 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	No goodwill impairment was identified as a result of the 2016 and 2017 annual impairment tests.
103730_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	The recorded impairment charge is noncash in nature and does not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests.
103730_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	As a result of a review of the financial results and outlook for the MOSFETs segment following the completion of production transfers, we determined that an interim indefinite-lived impairment test was required for our Siliconix tradenames as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	As a result of this analysis, we determined that our Siliconix tradenames, with a carrying value of $20.4 million, were impaired.
103730_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	We recorded an impairment charge of $1.6 million in 2016 to write-down the tradenames to their fair value.
103730_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	The tradenames are no longer considered indefinite-lived and the remaining value is being amortized over the 10 year estimated remaining useful life.
103730_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and our peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described above and more fully in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, we performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with our Capella business were not recoverable, and we recorded impairment charges totaling $57.6 million to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	We perform our annual indefinite-lived asset impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The interim impairment tests performed as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the last days of the fiscal third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, were effectively the annual impairment tests for 2016 and 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	The recorded impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect our liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	We occasionally use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	GAAP requires that entities identify the "functional currency" of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	A subsidiary's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P104_S3	However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company's operations generally would have the parent company's currency as its functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P104_S4	We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	The significant weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro in 2017 had significant impacts on our balance sheet.
103730_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	The dollar was weaker during 2017 versus 2016, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars increasing reported revenues and expenses versus 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P107_S3	On a weighted average basis for the full year 2016 versus 2015, the U.S. dollar was relatively unchanged versus relevant foreign currencies, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars having an immaterial impact on reported revenues and expenses versus 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	The cost of products sold and selling, general, and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been unfavorably impacted (compared to the prior year) by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	See Item 7A for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk and forward contracts used to mitigate certain foreign currency risks.
103730_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	We identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	We recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_18_ITEM7_P111_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	We historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	Consistent with industry practice, we also have a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby we consider, and grant at our discretion, requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	In addition, we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	We record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	We calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P113_S2	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments, but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Recording and monitoring of our sales accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions, with input from sales and marketing personnel and review, assessment, and, if necessary, adjustment by corporate management.
103730_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	While our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences, all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant, such as sales to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	In our judgment, the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals.
103730_18_ITEM7_P114_S3	We do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories, so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period.
103730_18_ITEM7_P114_S4	Nevertheless, we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent revenue recognition guidance that has not yet been adopted.
103730_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method and market based upon net realizable value.
103730_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	The valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P116_S2	For work in process goods, we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products.
103730_18_ITEM7_P116_S3	For finished goods, we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold.
103730_18_ITEM7_P116_S4	Inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments and market conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	We record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals.
103730_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our goodwill impairment tests.
103730_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units required for a quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P120_S1	In addition, changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting unit and the amount of the goodwill impairment charge.
103730_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	See Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses.
103730_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions measured at a point in time.
103730_18_ITEM7_P122_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	Our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	We are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible.
103730_18_ITEM7_P125_S2	We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our receivables are outstanding, the financial circumstances of individual customers, and general business and economic conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	Due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries, we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
103730_18_ITEM7_P126_S1	As of December 31, 2017, one customer comprised 16.1% of our accounts receivable balance.
103730_18_ITEM7_P126_S2	This customer comprised 15.4% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P126_S3	No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	We continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_18_ITEM7_P127_S1	We believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	Our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the United States, Germany, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
103730_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	At December 31, 2017, our U.S. plans include various non-qualified plans.
103730_18_ITEM7_P128_S2	As further described below, our U.S. plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") was terminated and settled in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	The table below summarizes information about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements (amounts in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	Accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	The discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
103730_18_ITEM7_P130_S2	Other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels, estimated mortality, and for certain postretirement medical plans, increases or trends in health care costs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P130_S3	Management reviews these assumptions at least annually.
103730_18_ITEM7_P130_S4	We use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P130_S5	These assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	In the U.S., we utilize published long-term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	In Germany and the Republic of China (Taiwan), we utilize published long-term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date.
103730_18_ITEM7_P131_S2	We utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P131_S3	We believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled.
103730_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Non-qualified plans in the U.S. are considered by law to be unfunded.
103730_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	However, the Company maintains assets in a rabbi trust to fund benefit payments under certain of these plans.
103730_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	Many of our non-U.S. plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	For those non-U.S. plans that do maintain investments, their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities, based on local laws and customs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	Some non-U.S. plans also informally fund their plans by holding certain available-for-sale investments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P133_S3	Such assets would be subject to creditor claims under certain conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	We set the expected long-term rate of return based on the expected long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	In establishing this rate, we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P134_S2	The expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense.
103730_18_ITEM7_P134_S3	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred.
103730_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	The net deferral of past asset losses (gains) affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense (income).
103730_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008, we adopted amendments to our principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans, such that effective January 1, 2009, the plans were frozen.
103730_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits accrued after December 31, 2008.
103730_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, we executed two partial-settlement transactions to reduce the risk associated with our U.S. qualified pension obligations.
103730_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	These transactions reduced the number of participants the plan was obligated to pay by approximately 1,500 and also resulted in the recognition of non-cash settlement charges aggregating $15.6 million, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, we began the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan, our remaining U.S. qualified pension plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P138_S1	We completed the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan in December 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P138_S2	The termination and settlement required no additional cash contributions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P138_S3	Excess plan assets were transferred to a qualified defined contribution retirement plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P138_S4	We recognized pre-tax non-cash settlement charges aggregating $79.3 million in 2016, representing previously unrecognized actuarial items.
103730_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	We continue to seek to de-risk our global pension exposures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	Such actions could result in increased net periodic pension cost due to lower expected rates of return on plan assets and/or possible additional charges to recognize unamortized actuarial items if all or a portion of the obligations were to be settled.
103730_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	We believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	However, if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes, we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions, and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet.
103730_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	See Note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our income tax policies.
103730_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	See "U.S. Tax Reform: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" above, for a discussion of the net expense recorded in 2017 related to the TCJA and qualitative disclosure of the future impact of the TCJA on our financial position, financial results, and liquidity.
103730_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits, but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P143_S1	Significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P143_S2	We periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
103730_18_ITEM7_P143_S3	The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities, our forecast of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	We have generally recognized net deferred tax assets only where there is a recent history of taxable income and forecasts of future taxable income.
103730_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	We and our subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as tax returns in multiple states and foreign jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has concluded examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through the 2012 tax year and we are not currently under examination for any years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	During 2017, the examinations of tax returns of principal non-U.S. subsidiaries in Germany (2009 through 2012) and Israel (2013 through 2015) were concluded, and certain other tax examinations were concluded and certain statutes of limitations lapsed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	Our tax provision for the year-ended December 31, 2017 includes tax benefits related to the resolution of these matters.
103730_18_ITEM7_P145_S4	The tax returns of other non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include France (2015 through 2016), India (2004 through 2014), Italy (2012 through 2016), and Taiwan (2016).
103730_18_ITEM7_P145_S5	We and our subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions around the world, many of which are still open to examination.
103730_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	Statement of operations' captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	We experienced a substantial, broad-based increase in demand for our products in 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	Demand for our products in 2016 increased compared to 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P150_S2	The increases in demand resulted in increases in net revenues compared to the prior year periods.
103730_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	We deduct, from the sales that we record to distributors, allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns, scrapped product, and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors.
103730_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	We make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made, although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods.
103730_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	We estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_18_ITEM7_P151_S3	We recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of $89.0 million, $86.9 million, and $83.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, or, as a percentage of gross sales, 3.3%, 3.6%, and 3.5%, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P151_S4	Actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately $87.4 million, $85.3 million, and $84.0 million, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P151_S5	Increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then-current business climate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	Royalty revenues, included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, were $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $3.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	The decrease is due to the expiration of certain licensing agreements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 26.9%, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased sales volume.
103730_18_ITEM7_P153_S2	We were able to offset the negative impacts of inflation and average selling price decline by our cost reductions and innovation, and maintain our contributive margin.
103730_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	Gross profit margins for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 24.5%, as compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	The increase was due primarily to higher volume, cost savings from our restructuring programs, and lower metals and materials prices.
103730_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our segments is provided below.
103730_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	Net revenues of the MOSFETs segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Changes in MOSFETs segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	Gross profit margins for the MOSFETs segment were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	The MOSFETs segment significantly increased its net revenues in 2017 versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	Sales volume increased in all regions and particularly in Asia, the segment's biggest market.
103730_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	Declining average selling prices and other negative factors had only small offsetting effects on the growth.
103730_18_ITEM7_P159_S3	Our IC products business contributed strongly to the growth.
103730_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	The gross profit margin for 2017 was significantly higher than the prior years and reflects the impact of the substantial completion of the cost reduction program (see below).
103730_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	The increase is primarily attributable to the revenue growth and the aforementioned cost reduction program, which exceeded the impact from lower average selling prices and cost inflation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	The prior year was also burdened by the recognition of fixed costs in inventory produced in 2015 due to the restructuring program and sold in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	The positive business climate led to less pricing pressure for our established MOSFETs products in 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	We experienced only a moderate decline in average selling prices in 2017 versus a significant decline in average selling prices in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	In 2013, we announced a cost reduction program to enhance the competitiveness of our MOSFETs segment and announced an extension of the program in November 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program is substantially implemented.
103730_18_ITEM7_P162_S2	The program included various cost reduction initiatives, primarily the transfer of manufacturing operations at our Santa Clara, California facility to other Vishay facilities or third-party subcontractors.
103730_18_ITEM7_P162_S3	We incurred cash charges of $26.7 million, primarily related to severance, to implement the program.
103730_18_ITEM7_P162_S4	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	We continue to make capital and R D investments in this business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	We will maintain our R D and management presence in the Silicon Valley area, and expect to move into a new R D facility in San Jose in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P163_S2	We are in the process of increasing manufacturing volume at third-party foundries and maximizing the output of our internal fab to meet the increased demand.
103730_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	Net revenues of the Diodes segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	Changes in Diodes segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	Gross profit margins for the Diodes segment were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	Net revenues of our Diodes segment increased significantly in 2017 versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	The increase was primarily from volume increases in all regions and sales channels, especially in Asia and Europe.
103730_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	We are increasing our manufacturing capacity in all critical lines to meet the increased demand.
103730_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	The declining average selling prices had a minor negative impact.
103730_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	The gross profit margin increased versus the prior year primarily due to increases in sales volume and the effects of our cost reduction activities.
103730_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	Declining average selling prices, cost inflation, and negative foreign currency effects only partially offset the increases.
103730_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	Pricing pressure for our established Diodes products was slightly reduced in 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	We experienced a moderate price decline versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	We own and operate a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_18_ITEM7_P172_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.
103730_18_ITEM7_P172_S3	The temporary shutdown adversely impacted 2015 revenues and margins of our Diodes segment (and total Vishay), but was also one of the primary reasons for the segment's volume increases in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Net revenues of the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	Changes in Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Gross profit margins for the Optoelectronic Components segment were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	The Optoelectronic Components segment net revenues increased significantly in 2017 versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	The volume increases, especially with distributors in all regions and European end customers, were only partially offset by a decrease in sales of our mobile sensor products in Asia and declining average selling prices.
103730_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	The increase in gross profit margin in 2017 versus the prior year is primarily due to the significant volume increase and general cost reduction activities, which offset the negative impact from lower average selling prices and general cost inflation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	The lower share of mobile sensors in 2017 also contributed to the gross profit margin increase.
103730_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	The overall positive business environment resulted in reduced pricing pressure for our established Optoelectronic Components products.
103730_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	We only experienced a slight decline in average selling prices versus the prior year versus a moderate average selling price decline in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	In 2015, we recorded long-lived depreciable and amortizable asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the Optoelectronic Components segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P179_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	Changes in Resistors Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	Gross profit margins for the Resistors Inductors segment were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	Net revenues of the Resistors Inductors segment increased significantly versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P183_S1	All regions experienced growth in net revenues with Europe and Asia experiencing the most significant growth.
103730_18_ITEM7_P183_S2	Distribution and the automotive and industrial end-markets contributed the most to the revenue increase.
103730_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	The gross profit margin increased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	The higher sales volume and cost reduction efforts were partially offset by some negative impacts of training requirements and overtime for additional production staff.
103730_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	Average selling prices declined slightly versus the prior year, consistent with historical performance.
103730_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	Market demand currently exceeds our capacity for certain product lines.
103730_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	Capital spending projects to expand capacity are underway with several expected to be completed in 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	In 2015, we announced global cost reduction programs which include targeted plans to streamline and consolidate certain product lines, including within our Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the programs were substantially completed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P187_S2	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	Changes in Capacitors segment net revenues were attributable to the following:
103730_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Gross profit margins for the Capacitors segment were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	Net revenues of the Capacitors segment in 2017 increased significantly versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P191_S1	All regions experienced growth in net revenues with Asia experiencing the most significant growth.
103730_18_ITEM7_P191_S2	Sales to distribution recovered from the 2016 decline and experienced a large increase.
103730_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	The gross profit margin increased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P192_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased sales volume and cost reduction efforts, partially offset by a less favorable product and customer mix, additional costs for overtime and training of new personnel, and unfavorable exchange rate impacts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	Average selling prices have decreased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	Capital spending projects are underway in response to the increased market demand for certain product lines.
103730_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	In 2015, we announced global cost reduction programs which include targeted plans to streamline and consolidate certain product lines, including within our Capacitors segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P195_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the programs were substantially completed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P195_S2	See "Cost Management" above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	In 2015, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $5.4 million in the Capacitors segment.
103730_18_ITEM7_P196_S1	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P197_S0	Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P198_S0	SG A increased slightly versus the prior year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P198_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and negative foreign currency impacts, which were partially offset by the effects of our cost reduction programs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P198_S2	The overall increase in SG A expenses in 2016 versus 2015 is primarily due to increased R D expenses, higher environmental remediation costs, and additional compensation costs in general, partially offset by lower amortization expense and our cost reduction programs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P199_S0	Certain items included in SG A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P200_S0	Certain intangible assets became fully amortized in the second fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P200_S1	We recognized indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 and amortizable intangible asset impairment charges of $57.6 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P200_S2	Additionally, in September 2016, we began to amortize our Siliconix tradenames, which were previously considered indefinite-lived, over their remaining useful life of 10 years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P200_S3	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P201_S0	In 2013 and 2015, we announced restructuring programs targeting SG A expenses.
103730_18_ITEM7_P201_S1	These programs were substantially implemented as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P201_S2	See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and "Cost Management" above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P202_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $2.2 million versus the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P202_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher average outstanding balances and slightly higher interest rates on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures, partially offset by decreases in the estimated values of the embedded derivatives associated with our convertible debentures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P203_S0	In 2017, we sold our 50% interest in an investment accounted for using the equity method, and recorded a loss aggregating to $6.1 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P203_S1	The loss recorded in March 2017 included our proportionate share of the investee's accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.1 million, recognized upon discontinuation of the equity investment, and the estimated cost of certain contingencies pending resolution related to the investee.
103730_18_ITEM7_P203_S2	In December 2017, the contingencies were favorably settled and we reduced the loss by $0.9 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P203_S3	The loss on disposal is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_18_ITEM7_P204_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P205_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $0.1 million versus the year ended December 31, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P205_S1	The increase is primarily due to higher average outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and increased amortization of the debt discounts associated with our convertible senior debentures, partially offset by decreases in the estimated values of the embedded derivatives associated with our convertible debentures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P206_S0	The following table analyzes the components of the line "Other" on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):
103730_18_ITEM7_P207_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the effective tax rates were 107.0%, 47.6%, and 244.1%, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P207_S1	Historically, the effective tax rates are generally less than the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P207_S2	While our effective tax rate has historically been less than the U.S. statutory rate, the effective tax rate for each of the years presented is higher than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to certain discrete items recorded in each year.
103730_18_ITEM7_P207_S3	These items were $230.6 million in 2017, $22.6 million in 2016, and $152.4 million in 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P208_S0	The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was significantly impacted by the effect of the TCJA (see "U.S. Tax Reform: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" above).
103730_18_ITEM7_P208_S1	As permitted by SAB No. 118, the net tax expense recorded in our financial statements for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the TCJA is considered "provisional," based on reasonable estimates.
103730_18_ITEM7_P208_S2	The net tax expense recorded was $234.9 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P208_S3	We are continuing to collect and analyze detailed information that could impact this amount, and may record adjustments to refine those estimates during the measurement period defined in SAB No. 118, as additional analysis is completed.
103730_18_ITEM7_P209_S0	Also during 2017, we recorded $5.8 million of tax benefit for periodic remeasurement related to the 2015 cash repatriation program described below, and $1.6 million of net tax expense for changes in uncertain tax positions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P210_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the discrete items include $34.9 million of additional tax expense related to the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan (see above and Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements), $8.7 million (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions largely related to statute expiration, and $3.6 million tax benefit for periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the cash repatriation program described below.
103730_18_ITEM7_P211_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the discrete items included $164.0 million of expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter primarily to repatriate $300.0 million of foreign earnings to the United States, following an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions (the "2015 cash repatriation program") .
103730_18_ITEM7_P211_S1	It also includes $8.9 million (tax benefit) for changes in valuation allowances and $2.6 million (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P212_S0	The 2015 cash repatriation program was expected to occur over several years, and the deferred tax liability is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each respective balance sheet date.
103730_18_ITEM7_P212_S1	Changes in the underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.
103730_18_ITEM7_P213_S0	As a result of the TCJA, we have terminated the 2015 cash repatriation plan and replaced it as described in "U.S. Tax Reform: Tax Cut and Jobs Act" above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P214_S0	We operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States.
103730_18_ITEM7_P214_S1	Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P215_S0	Part of our historical strategy has been to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
103730_18_ITEM7_P215_S1	Accordingly, our effective tax rate has historically been less than the U.S. statutory rate, except in years where there are material discrete items.
103730_18_ITEM7_P216_S0	The TCJA significantly reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate, to a rate that is less than the applicable tax rates of many of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P216_S1	Furthermore, our GAAP interest expense generally exceeds our U.S.-based operating income, resulting in pre-tax losses in the U.S.
103730_18_ITEM7_P216_S2	Accordingly, we have historically recorded U.S. federal tax benefits, at 35%, which had the effect of reducing our consolidated GAAP tax rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P216_S3	Accordingly, the reduction in the statutory U.S. tax rate will generally increase our consolidated GAAP tax rate due to the loss of these tax benefits recognized on a GAAP basis.
103730_18_ITEM7_P216_S4	We are still evaluating the effects of the TCJA on our future effective tax rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P216_S5	Other actions independent of the TCJA will also impact the future effective tax rate.
103730_18_ITEM7_P217_S0	Additional information about income taxes is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P218_S0	We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
103730_18_ITEM7_P218_S1	The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy, to reduce debt levels, and to pay dividends and repurchase stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P218_S2	We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past 16 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past 23 years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P219_S0	Management uses a non-GAAP measure, "free cash," to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
103730_18_ITEM7_P219_S1	See "Overview" above for "free cash" definition and reconciliation to GAAP.
103730_18_ITEM7_P220_S0	Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 21 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the past 16 years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P220_S1	We continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
103730_18_ITEM7_P221_S0	We continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash during the year ended December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P221_S1	We generated $200 million of free cash in 2017, which is higher than our historical average.
103730_18_ITEM7_P221_S2	There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels, or at all, going forward if the current economic environment worsens.
103730_18_ITEM7_P222_S0	Beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we have reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company's capital structure.
103730_18_ITEM7_P222_S1	We have completed three issuances of low-coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance.
103730_18_ITEM7_P222_S2	We utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase approximately 24% of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives.
103730_18_ITEM7_P223_S0	On May 2, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, pursuant to which we repurchased 1,752,454 shares of stock for $23.2 million in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P223_S1	That stock repurchase plan expired on May 2, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P224_S0	On August 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $150 million of our outstanding common stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P224_S1	The stock repurchase plan will expire on June 1, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P224_S2	The stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated or suspended at any time at the Company's direction in accordance with the plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P224_S3	We repurchased 2,250,236 shares of stock for $39.9 million since the inception of this plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P225_S0	In 2016, we acquired, in two privately negotiated transactions, all of the outstanding exchangeable notes due 2102.
103730_18_ITEM7_P225_S1	The total purchase price for the two transactions was $34.0 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P225_S2	The exchangeable unsecured notes were issued in 2002 in connection with an acquisition, and were subject to a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_18_ITEM7_P225_S3	The repurchased notes had been exchangeable for approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P226_S0	We also entered into a new, larger, revolving credit facility in 2010, which was amended and restated on August 8, 2013, and further amended and restated on December 10, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P226_S1	The amended and restated credit facility provides an aggregate commitment of $640 million of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020, and we have the ability to request up to $50 million of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P226_S2	The previous credit agreement was scheduled to mature on August 8, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM7_P226_S3	At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $150 million and $143 million, respectively, were outstanding under our credit facility.
103730_18_ITEM7_P227_S0	The amended and restated credit facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends to stockholders and share repurchases, provided our pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_18_ITEM7_P227_S1	If our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the credit facility allows such payments up to $75 million per annum (subject to a cap of $225 million for the term of the facility).
103730_18_ITEM7_P227_S2	The amended and restated credit facility provides us with significantly more flexibility to execute these transactions, and our ability to utilize some of our foreign-source income for these types of transactions provides even further financial flexibility.
103730_18_ITEM7_P228_S0	Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_18_ITEM7_P228_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
103730_18_ITEM7_P228_S2	Based on our current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_18_ITEM7_P228_S3	The interest rate on our borrowings will increase to LIBOR plus 2.00% if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to LIBOR plus 1.50% if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_18_ITEM7_P229_S0	We also pay a fee, also based on our leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P229_S1	The undrawn commitment fee, based on our current leverage ratio, is 0.35% per annum.
103730_18_ITEM7_P229_S2	Such undrawn commitment fee will increase to 0.50% per annum if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1 and will decrease to 0.30% per annum if our leverage ratio decreases below 1.50 to 1.
103730_18_ITEM7_P229_S3	Prior to the December 10, 2015 amendment and restatement, the credit agreement required Vishay to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount.
103730_18_ITEM7_P230_S0	The borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P230_S1	Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
103730_18_ITEM7_P230_S2	Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM7_P231_S0	The credit facility also limits or restricts us, from, among other things, incurring indebtedness, incurring liens on assets, making investments and acquisitions, and making asset sales, and making other restricted payments (assuming our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1), and requires us to comply with other covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios.
103730_18_ITEM7_P232_S0	The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
103730_18_ITEM7_P232_S1	The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article VI of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 10, 2015.
103730_18_ITEM7_P233_S0	We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P233_S1	Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 14.99 to 1 and 1.51 to 1, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P233_S2	We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
103730_18_ITEM7_P234_S0	If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
103730_18_ITEM7_P234_S1	Additionally, our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
103730_18_ITEM7_P235_S0	The balance of our revolving credit facility was $143 million at December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P235_S1	We borrowed $557 million and repaid $550 million on our credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P235_S2	The average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month-ends was $213 million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was $273 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, our convertible senior debentures are convertible by the holders under certain circumstances.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S1	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2016 evaluation of the conversion criteria, remained convertible subsequent to the April 1, 2017, July 1, 2017, and September 30, 2017 evaluations, and remain convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2017 evaluation, due to the sale price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 and the first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S2	The convertible debentures due 2040 became convertible subsequent to the September 30, 2017 evaluation of the conversion criteria and remain convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2017 evaluation due to the sale price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S3	Such debentures will remain convertible until March 31, 2018, at which time the conversion criteria will be reevaluated.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S4	At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of our common stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S5	We intend to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under our credit facility.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S6	Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2042 continues to be classified as a noncurrent liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S7	No conversions have occurred to date.
103730_18_ITEM7_P236_S8	The convertible debentures due 2041 are not currently convertible.
103730_18_ITEM7_P237_S0	As of December 31, 2017, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment were held in countries outside of the United States.
103730_18_ITEM7_P238_S0	The TCJA imposes a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings of 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets, payable in defined increments over eight years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P238_S1	As a result of this requirement, we provisionally expect to pay $180.0 million, net of estimated applicable foreign tax credits, and after utilization of net operating loss and R D and FTC Credit carryforwards.
103730_18_ITEM7_P238_S2	Based on our U.S. cash position, we expect that we will be required to repatriate amounts from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States to satisfy this tax obligation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P239_S0	These previously deferred foreign earnings may now be repatriated to the United States without additional U.S. federal taxation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P239_S1	However, any such repatriation could incur withholding and other foreign taxes in the source jurisdiction, and certain U.S. state taxes.
103730_18_ITEM7_P240_S0	Additionally, cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and principal and interest payments on our debt instruments need to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_18_ITEM7_P240_S1	Our U.S. subsidiaries have other operating cash needs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P241_S0	During 2017 and 2016, we repatriated $38.0 million and $46.0 million pursuant to our 2015 cash repatriation program.
103730_18_ITEM7_P241_S1	The 2015 cash repatriation program has been cancelled due to the TCJA, and replaced with the planned cash repatriation described in "U.S. Tax Reform: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P242_S0	Our substantially undrawn credit facility provides us with significant operating liquidity in the United States.
103730_18_ITEM7_P243_S0	Management expects to periodically pay down the balance of our revolving credit facility with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short-term financing needs.
103730_18_ITEM7_P243_S1	We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, regular dividend payments, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
103730_18_ITEM7_P243_S2	Additional acquisition activity, share repurchases, or conversion of our convertible debentures may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
103730_18_ITEM7_P243_S3	No principal payments on our debt are due before the maturity of our revolving credit facility in December 2020.
103730_18_ITEM7_P244_S0	As described above, we plan to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy the TCJA transition tax, which is payable in increments over eight years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P245_S0	We invest a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P245_S1	As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
103730_18_ITEM7_P246_S0	The interest rates on our short-term investments vary by location, but can be up to 150 bps higher than the interest rates on our cash accounts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P246_S1	The average interest rate on our short-term investments was 0.74% due to the low interest rate environment in Europe.
103730_18_ITEM7_P246_S2	Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.
103730_18_ITEM7_P247_S0	The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) (in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P248_S0	*Represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures, which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures, net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability.
103730_18_ITEM7_P249_S0	"Net cash and short-term investments (debt)" does not have a uniform definition and is not recognized in accordance with GAAP.
103730_18_ITEM7_P249_S1	This measure should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
103730_18_ITEM7_P249_S2	However, management believes that an analysis of "net cash and short-term investments (debt)" assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management.
103730_18_ITEM7_P250_S0	The measure, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
103730_18_ITEM7_P251_S0	Our financial condition as of December 31, 2017 continued to be strong, with a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 3.9 to 1, as compared to 4.1 to 1 as of December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P251_S1	The decrease is primarily due to increased trade accounts payable and income taxes payable, which were only partially offset by increases in nearly all current assets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P251_S2	Our ratio of total debt to Vishay stockholders' equity was 0.26 to 1 at December 31, 2017 as compared to a ratio of 0.23 to 1 at December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P251_S3	The increase in the ratio is primarily due to reclassification of the equity portion of our convertible debentures due 2040 from permanent to temporary equity due to the sale price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P252_S0	Cash flows provided by operating activities were $368.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to cash flows provided by operations of $296.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P252_S1	The improvement in operating cash flows is primarily due to the increase in pre-tax earnings.
103730_18_ITEM7_P252_S2	Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.0 million of cash contributions to our Taiwanese pension plans and restructuring payments of $33.0 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P253_S0	Cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $170.4 million, as compared to $134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7_P253_S1	We expect capital spending of approximately $210 million in 2018, in accordance with requirements of our markets.
103730_18_ITEM7_P253_S2	Some of this 2018 capital spending represents an acceleration of expected expansion from later years of our long-range plan.
103730_18_ITEM7_P254_S0	Cash paid for dividends to our common and Class B common stockholders totalled $37.0 million and $36.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM7_P254_S1	We expect dividend payments in 2018 to total approximately $38.9 million.
103730_18_ITEM7_P254_S2	However, any future dividend declaration and payment remains subject to authorization by our Board of Directors.
103730_18_ITEM7_P255_S0	As of December 31, 2017 we had contractual obligations as follows (in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM7_P256_S0	Commitments for long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P256_S1	Accordingly, the discounts and capitalized deferred financing costs associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of long-term debt commitments in the table above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P257_S0	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement and include fees under our revolving credit facility, which expires on December 10, 2020.
103730_18_ITEM7_P257_S1	Commitments for interest payments on long-term debt exclude non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042.
103730_18_ITEM7_P258_S0	Various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P258_S1	Among other things, approximately $575 million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into common stock.
103730_18_ITEM7_P258_S2	Also, although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures.
103730_18_ITEM7_P258_S3	Additionally, interest commitments for our revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at December 31, 2017, but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time.
103730_18_ITEM7_P259_S0	The TCJA imposes a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings of 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets, payable in defined increments over eight years.
103730_18_ITEM7_P259_S1	As a result of this requirement, we provisionally expect to pay $180.0 million, net of estimated applicable foreign tax credits, and after utilization of net operating loss and R D and FTC Credit carryforwards.
103730_18_ITEM7_P260_S0	Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 includes liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business.
103730_18_ITEM7_P260_S1	Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM7_P260_S2	Accordingly, we have classified the amount recorded as a current liability as payable within one year, and the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_18_ITEM7_P261_S0	There are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among Vishay and VPG in accordance with the terms of the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_18_ITEM7_P261_S1	The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_18_ITEM7_P261_S2	See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Tax Matters Agreement.
103730_18_ITEM7_P261_S3	These obligations are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above, but were not material to us as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P262_S0	Expected pension and postretirement plan funding is based on a projected schedule of benefit payments under the plans.
103730_18_ITEM7_P263_S0	We maintain long-term foundry arrangements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity for our semiconductor products.
103730_18_ITEM7_P263_S1	The purchase commitments in the table above represent the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these arrangements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P263_S2	Our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments.
103730_18_ITEM7_P264_S0	Other long-term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7_P264_S1	We include the current portion of the long-term liabilities in the table above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P264_S2	Other long-term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above, although actual timing of payments may be sooner.
103730_18_ITEM7_P265_S0	For a further discussion of our long-term debt, pensions and other postretirement benefits, leases, uncertain tax positions, and purchase commitments, see Notes 5, 6, 11, and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM7_P266_S0	We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than the operating leases described above.
103730_18_ITEM7_P267_S0	Normally, inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long-term contracts.
103730_18_ITEM7_P267_S1	Consequently, we can adjust our selling prices, to the extent permitted by competition and other market conditions, to reflect cost increases caused by inflation.
103730_18_ITEM7_P268_S0	See also "Commodity Price Risk" included in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional related information.
103730_18_ITEM7_P269_S0	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to certain financial risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	On a selective basis, we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The interest paid on our credit facility is based on a LIBOR spread.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	At December 31, 2017, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Our convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate, and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2017, we have $748.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $547.1 million of short-term investments, which earn interest at various variable rates.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Based on the debt and cash positions at December 31, 2017, we would expect a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately $4.0 million.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long-term debt.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Also see "Economic Outlook and Impact on Operations and Future Financial Results" included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional discussion of market risks.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of these exposures.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We entered into forward contracts with highly-rated financial institutions to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The notional amount of the forward contracts was $100 million as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The forward contracts are short-term in nature and are expected to be renewed at our discretion until the intercompany loans are repaid.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P8_S3	We have not designated the forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and as such the change in the fair value of contracts is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We do not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in Germany, Israel, and Asia.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S2	Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S3	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S4	Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in Israel, the Czech Republic, and China because the percentage of expenses denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in Israeli shekels, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi to total sales.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S5	Therefore, if the Israeli shekel, Czech koruna, and Chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is reduced.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S6	Where possible, we maintain local currency denominated cash balances in these countries approximately equal to the local currency liabilities to naturally hedge our exposures.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S7	We also have a slightly higher percentage of euro-denominated sales than expenses.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S8	Therefore, when the euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies, our operating profit is slightly increased.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P10_S9	Accordingly, we monitor several important cross-rates.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	We have performed sensitivity analyses of our consolidated foreign exchange risk as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P11_S2	The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately $9.0 million and $9.1 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P11_S3	For example, a 10% weakening in all foreign currencies would decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies, which would be offset by foreign exchange gains of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in U.S. dollars or have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical 10% movement in the value of the U.S. dollar, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price changes for these raw materials.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S2	The determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above, incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations, and face public scrutiny.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S3	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S4	For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S5	Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P13_S6	We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Silicon wafers are manufactured from high-purity silicon, a metalloid.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P15_S1	There have at times been industry-wide shortages of high-purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries, and limited growth in high-purity silicon manufacturing capacities.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P15_S2	Shifts in demand for high-purity silicon and in turn, silicon wafers, have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P16_S0	We are a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum, a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P16_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Palladium, a metal used to produce multi-layer ceramic capacitors, is currently found primarily in South Africa and Russia.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P17_S2	We periodically enter into short-term commitments to purchase palladium.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products, such as copper, are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P18_S1	Our policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget.
103730_18_ITEM7A_P19_S0	We estimate that a 10% increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by $6.1 million, assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices.
103730_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1 of this report.
103730_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

103730_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").
103730_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
103730_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
103730_18_ITEM15_P78_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
103730_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
103730_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
103730_18_ITEM15_P79_S2	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
103730_18_ITEM15_P79_S3	Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P79_S4	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P79_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
103730_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	We have audited Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
103730_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	In our opinion, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
103730_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements") and our report dated February 16, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
103730_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
103730_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
103730_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
103730_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
103730_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
103730_18_ITEM15_P85_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
103730_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
103730_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting incudes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of managements and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P87_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to provide future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
103730_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. ("Vishay" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
103730_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	Semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by the Company are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronics products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vishay and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained.
103730_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership is less than 100 percent, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P90_S2	Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis.
103730_18_ITEM15_P90_S3	Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
103730_18_ITEM15_P90_S4	All intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits are eliminated.
103730_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	The Company recognizes revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete.
103730_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed or determinable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P91_S2	For the portion of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
103730_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company historically has had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return.
103730_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	Consistent with industry practice, the Company also has a "stock, ship and debit" program whereby it considers requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors' inventory, to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing.
103730_18_ITEM15_P92_S2	In addition, the Company has contractual arrangements whereby it provides distributors with protection against price reductions initiated by the Company after product is sold by the Company to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor.
103730_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company records a reduction of revenue during each period, and records a related accrued expense for the period, based upon its estimate of product returns, scrap allowances, "stock, ship and debit" credits, and price protection credits that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period.
103730_18_ITEM15_P93_S1	The Company makes these estimates based upon sales levels to its distributors during the period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market conditions, and historical experience under the programs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P93_S2	While the Company utilizes a number of different methodologies to estimate the accruals, all of the methodologies take into account sales levels to distributors during the relevant period, inventory levels at the distributors, current and projected market trends and conditions, recent and historical activity under the relevant programs, changes in program policies, and open requests for credits.
103730_18_ITEM15_P93_S3	These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P93_S4	The Company believes that it has a reasonable basis to estimate future credits under the programs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in costs of products sold.
103730_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
103730_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	The amount charged to expense for research and development (exclusive of purchased in-process research and development) aggregated $67,153, $66,842, and $64,193, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	The Company spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new processes and for cost reduction measures.
103730_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P96_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
103730_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
103730_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets which the Company believes do not meet GAAP criteria of "more likely than not" to be realized.
103730_18_ITEM15_P97_S3	This criterion requires a level of judgment regarding future taxable income, which may be revised due to changes in market conditions, tax laws, or other factors.
103730_18_ITEM15_P97_S4	If the Company's assumptions and estimates change in the future, valuation allowances established may be increased, resulting in increased tax expense.
103730_18_ITEM15_P97_S5	Conversely, if the Company is ultimately able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then the related portion of the valuation allowance can be released, resulting in decreased tax expense.
103730_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
103730_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
103730_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company's belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
103730_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on management's best estimate of potential tax exposures.
103730_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by tax authorities and finally resolved.
103730_18_ITEM15_P100_S2	Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution.
103730_18_ITEM15_P100_S3	Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.
103730_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	The amount included in current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect only amounts expected to be settled in cash within one year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	Cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
103730_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	Highly liquid investments with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P102_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	The Company evaluates the past-due status of its trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale.
103730_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
103730_18_ITEM15_P104_S2	Bad debt expense (income realized upon subsequent collection) was $301, $61, and $(152) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or market.
103730_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand, technology developments, and market conditions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	Property and equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P106_S1	Machinery and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of seven to ten years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P106_S2	Buildings and building improvements are being depreciated over useful lives of twenty to forty years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P106_S3	Construction in progress is not depreciated until the assets are placed in service.
103730_18_ITEM15_P106_S4	The estimated cost to complete construction in progress at December 31, 2017 was approximately $79,000.
103730_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	Depreciation of capital lease assets is included in total depreciation expense.
103730_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	Depreciation expense was $148,883, $144,521, and $154,340 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	Gains and losses on the disposal of assets which do not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations are included in the determination of operating margin (within selling, general, and administrative expenses).
103730_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	Individually material gains and losses on disposal are separately disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition.
103730_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	Certain of the Company's tradenames were assigned indefinite useful lives.
103730_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
103730_18_ITEM15_P110_S2	These tests are performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
103730_18_ITEM15_P110_S3	The Company's business segments (see Note 15) represent its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P110_S4	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment tests performed in 2016 and 2015.
103730_18_ITEM15_P110_S5	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the Company has no recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
103730_18_ITEM15_P111_S1	Patents and acquired technology are being amortized over useful lives of seven to twenty-five years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P111_S2	Capitalized software is amortized over periods of three to ten years, primarily included in costs of products sold on the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P111_S3	Customer relationships are amortized over useful lives of five to twenty years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P111_S4	Noncompete agreements are amortized over periods of three to ten years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P111_S5	The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P112_S0	GAAP prescribes a quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P112_S1	The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative impairment test.
103730_18_ITEM15_P112_S2	If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required.
103730_18_ITEM15_P112_S3	If it is determined that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.
103730_18_ITEM15_P113_S0	The Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit.
103730_18_ITEM15_P113_S1	The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis (an income approach).
103730_18_ITEM15_P113_S2	If the net book value of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value, the Company would recognize an impairment charge.
103730_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	The carrying value of long-lived assets held-and-used, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.
103730_18_ITEM15_P114_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P114_S2	In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset group.
103730_18_ITEM15_P115_S0	Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_18_ITEM15_P115_S1	Losses on long-lived assets held-for-sale, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for anticipated disposal costs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P116_S0	See Note 3 for further information on the impairment tests performed in 2016 and 2015.
103730_18_ITEM15_P117_S0	Short-term investments and other assets reported on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include time deposits with financial institutions whose original maturity exceeds three months, but less than one year and investments in marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale.
103730_18_ITEM15_P117_S1	These assets include assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans (see Note 11) and assets that are intended to fund a portion of the Company's other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_18_ITEM15_P117_S2	These assets are reported at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the end of the reporting period.
103730_18_ITEM15_P117_S3	Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of their related tax consequences, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until sold.
103730_18_ITEM15_P117_S4	At the time of sale, the assets that are held in trust related to the Company's non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans, any gains (losses) calculated by the specific identification method are recognized as a reduction (increase) to benefits expense, within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_18_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business, including from time to time, derivative financial instruments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P118_S1	Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into contracts that are not considered derivative financial instruments in their entirety, but that include embedded derivative features.
103730_18_ITEM15_P118_S2	The convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 contain embedded derivatives that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
103730_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, outstanding derivative instruments were not material.
103730_18_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company reports derivative instruments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
103730_18_ITEM15_P120_S1	The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
103730_18_ITEM15_P120_S2	For instruments designated as hedges, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_18_ITEM15_P120_S3	Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, including embedded derivatives, are recorded in current period net earnings (loss).
103730_18_ITEM15_P121_S0	The Company has in the past used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations, thereby reducing exposure to market rate fluctuations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Company uses financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to mitigate a portion, but not all, of the risk associated with its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
103730_18_ITEM15_P122_S1	The purpose of the Company's foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P123_S0	Other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, held-to-maturity short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes payable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P123_S1	The carrying amounts of these financial instruments reported on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM15_P124_S0	Compensation costs related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P125_S0	The amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity (or liability) instruments issued.
103730_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
103730_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	For awards subject to graded vesting, the Company recognizes expense over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.
103730_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs") that are expected to vest and records cumulative adjustments in the period that the expectation changes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company has significant operations outside of the United States.
103730_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Company finances its operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM15_P128_S2	The Company's operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
103730_18_ITEM15_P129_S1	Translation adjustments do not impact the consolidated results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
103730_18_ITEM15_P129_S2	Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P129_S3	While the translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars does not directly impact the statement of operations, the translation effectively increases or decreases the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies.
103730_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
103730_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.
103730_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	The costs for a specific environmental remediation site are discounted if the aggregate amount of the obligation and the amount and timing of the cash payments for that site are fixed or reliably determinable based upon information derived from the remediation plan for that site.
103730_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters recorded at December 31, 2017 and 2016 do not include claims against third parties.
103730_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	Restructuring and severance costs reflect charges resulting from cost reduction programs implemented by the Company.
103730_18_ITEM15_P133_S1	Restructuring and severance costs include exit costs, severance benefits pursuant to an on-going arrangement, voluntary termination compensation under a defined program, and any related pension curtailment and settlement charges.
103730_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	The Company recognizes expense for one-time benefits only after management has committed to a plan, the plan is sufficiently detailed to provide the number, classification, and location of employees to be terminated as well as the expected completion date, the plan has been sufficiently communicated to employees such that they are able to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if terminated, and it is unlikely that the plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.
103730_18_ITEM15_P134_S1	If an employee is not required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense once the aforementioned criteria have been met.
103730_18_ITEM15_P134_S2	If an employee is required to render service beyond a minimum retention period, the Company recognizes expense over the period that the employee is required to render future service.
103730_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	The Company recognizes expense for on-going benefit arrangements when the liability is reasonably estimable and considered probable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	The Company recognizes expense for voluntary separation / early retirement when the employee delivers an irrevocable voluntary termination notice pursuant to a defined company program.
103730_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Company recognizes other exit costs as incurred.
103730_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers' liability, and vehicle liability.
103730_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	As part of its self-insurance program for certain risks, the Company created a wholly-owned captive insurance entity in 2007.
103730_18_ITEM15_P139_S1	At December 31, 2017, the captive insurance entity provides only property and general liability insurance, although it is licensed to also provide casualty and directors' and officers' insurance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P139_S2	The captive insurance entity had $560 accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2017 and no amounts accrued for outstanding claims at December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	Certain cash and investments held by the captive insurance entity are restricted primarily for the purpose of potential insurance claims.
103730_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	Restricted cash of $9,438 and $10,211 is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing required statutory reserves of the captive insurance entity.
103730_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash in a manner that reflects the Company's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
103730_18_ITEM15_P141_S1	The liability component at issuance is recognized at fair value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature.
103730_18_ITEM15_P141_S2	A discount is recorded if debentures are issued at a coupon rate which is below the rate of a similar instrument that did not have a conversion feature at issuance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P141_S3	The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance costs and the deferred tax impact, and is recorded as capital in excess of par.
103730_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	Debt discounts are amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt.
103730_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
103730_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	The ASU is the result of the FASB's simplification initiative intended to improve GAAP by reducing costs and complexity while maintaining or enhancing the usefulness of related financial statement information.
103730_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
103730_18_ITEM15_P144_S2	The Company adopted the ASU on January 1, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P144_S3	The ASU allowed prospective adoption of certain aspects, while requiring retrospective adoption of other aspects of the guidance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	The Company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits in January 1, 2017 retained earnings (accumulated deficit) of $386.
103730_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	The Company reclassified $542 and $639 of cash withholding taxes paid when shares were withheld for vested equity awards in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to financing cash flows.
103730_18_ITEM15_P145_S2	The Company retrospectively reclassified an immaterial amount of excess tax benefits as operating cash flows on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
103730_18_ITEM15_P145_S3	The Company will recognize forfeitures on its stock-based awards as they occur.
103730_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted in the United States.
103730_18_ITEM15_P146_S1	The TCJA represents sweeping changes in U.S. tax law.
103730_18_ITEM15_P146_S2	Under GAAP (specifically, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 740), the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.
103730_18_ITEM15_P146_S3	The total effect of tax law changes on deferred tax balances is recorded as a component of income tax expense.
103730_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	In response to the TCJA, the Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB No. 118") to provide guidance to registrants in applying ASC Topic 740 in connection with the TCJA.
103730_18_ITEM15_P147_S1	SAB No. 118 provides that in the period of enactment, the income tax effects of the TCJA may be reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate (to the extent a reasonable estimate can be determined), which would be subject to adjustment during a "measurement period".
103730_18_ITEM15_P147_S2	The measurement period begins in the reporting period of the TCJA's enactment and ends when a registrant has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740.
103730_18_ITEM15_P147_S3	SAB No. 118 also describes supplemental disclosures that should accompany the provisional amounts.
103730_18_ITEM15_P147_S4	The Company has applied the guidance in SAB No. 118 to account for the financial accounting impacts of the TCJA as of December 31, 2017, and has provided the applicable supplemental disclosures in Note 5.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S1	The ASU is the result of a convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S2	The ASU removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; provides more useful information to users of financial statements through expanded disclosure requirements; and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S4	The Company intends to retrospectively adopt the ASU effective January 1, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S5	Based on work performed to date, the Company expects to record a cumulative-effect adjustment of approximately $2,500 to January 1, 2016 retained earnings (accumulated deficit) upon the retrospective adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 for certain custom products where revenue will be recognized throughout the production process.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S6	The Company also expects to record a reclassification of warranty expenses from costs of products sold to contra-revenue of $4,154 and $6,103 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P148_S7	The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities .
103730_18_ITEM15_P149_S1	The ASU enhances the reporting model for financial instruments by addressing certain aspects, including requiring equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifying the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values; eliminating the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the disclosed fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost; and requiring the use of the exit price notion for fair value measurements of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P149_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
103730_18_ITEM15_P149_S3	The Company will recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) of $1,801 on January 1, 2018 for the cumulative change in fair value of available-for-sale equity investments previously recognized in other comprehensive income.
103730_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
103730_18_ITEM15_P150_S1	The ASU is the result of a project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P150_S2	Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company will recognize lease assets and liabilities for its operating leases which are not currently reported on its consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P150_S3	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with the ability to early adopt.
103730_18_ITEM15_P150_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its lease contracts.
103730_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .
103730_18_ITEM15_P151_S1	The ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P151_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020, with the ability to early adopt for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
103730_18_ITEM15_P151_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its financial assets measured at amortized cost.
103730_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.
103730_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	The ASU amends the income statement presentation requirements of net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
103730_18_ITEM15_P152_S2	The ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and requires retrospective adoption.
103730_18_ITEM15_P152_S3	Upon adoption, the Company will reclassify the components of net benefit costs other than the current service component, currently presented as $3,497 and $4,040 of cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $8,919 and $11,981 million of selling, general, and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to other expenses.
103730_18_ITEM15_P152_S4	The Company will also reclassify the $79,321 U.S. pension settlement charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 to other expenses.
103730_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	In addition to the changes due to the retrospective adoption of certain aspects of new accounting guidance described above, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Company seeks to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which the Company has substantial marketing and technical expertise.
103730_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company deposited the $6,750 purchase price of Sonntag Electronic GmbH ("Sonntag").
103730_18_ITEM15_P155_S1	The purchase price, net of cash acquired was $5,450.
103730_18_ITEM15_P155_S2	The acquisition was effective January 1, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	Sonntag is a distributor of electronic components in Germany.
103730_18_ITEM15_P156_S1	The inclusion of this business did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P156_S2	After allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimation of their fair values at the date of acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $3,485 related to this acquisition.
103730_18_ITEM15_P156_S3	The goodwill related to this acquisition is included in the Resistors Inductors reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
103730_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	Had this acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, the pro forma statements of operations would not be materially different than the consolidated statements of operations presented.
103730_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	On February 8, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of UltraSource, Inc., a U.S.-based, privately-held thin film circuit and thin film interconnect manufacturer, for $13,372, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P158_S1	This business will be incorporated into the Company's Resistors Inductors segment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	As a result of a review of the financial results and outlook for the MOSFETs segment following the completion of production transfers, Vishay determined that an interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was required for its Siliconix tradenames as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	As a result of this analysis, the Company determined that its Siliconix tradenames, with a carrying value of $20,359, were impaired.
103730_18_ITEM15_P160_S1	The Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,559 to write-down the tradenames to their fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P160_S2	The tradenames are no longer considered indefinite-lived and the remaining value is being amortized over 10 years, which was the estimated remaining useful life.
103730_18_ITEM15_P161_S0	The fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
103730_18_ITEM15_P162_S0	The evaluation of the fair value of indefinite-lived trademarks requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P162_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the assumed market-royalty rate; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue.
103730_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	In light of a sustained decline in market capitalization for Vishay and its peer group companies, and other factors (including the cost reduction programs announced during the third fiscal quarter of 2015 as described in Note 4), Vishay determined that interim goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests were required as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2015.
103730_18_ITEM15_P164_S0	Prior to completing the interim assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company performed a recoverability test of certain depreciable and amortizable long-lived assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P164_S1	As a result of those assessments, it was determined that the depreciable and amortizable assets associated with the Company's Capella business were not recoverable, and the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $57,600 to write-down the related assets to their fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company determined that the estimated fair value of the Capacitors reporting unit was less than the net book value of that reporting unit.
103730_18_ITEM15_P165_S1	Upon completion of the impairment analysis for the Capacitors reporting unit, the Company recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $5,380.
103730_18_ITEM15_P166_S0	The fair value of long-lived assets is measured primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
103730_18_ITEM15_P166_S1	The evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the determination of their fair value, requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P166_S2	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	The fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes is measured primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the reporting unit.
103730_18_ITEM15_P167_S1	The calculated results are evaluated for reasonableness using comparable company data.
103730_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P168_S1	These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.
103730_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P169_S1	Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge; could have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group's carrying value is recoverable, that an indefinite-lived asset is not impaired, or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired.
103730_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter.
103730_18_ITEM15_P170_S1	The interim impairment tests performed as the last day of the third fiscal quarters of 2016 and 2015, were effectively the annual impairment tests for 2016 and 2015.
103730_18_ITEM15_P170_S2	No impairment was identified as a result of the Company's annual impairment test for 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P171_S0	The recorded impairment charges are noncash in nature and do not affect Vishay's liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or debt covenants, and will not have a material impact on future operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P172_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P173_S0	Other intangible assets are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P174_S0	Amortization expense (excluding capitalized software) was $14,263, $14,842, and $21,829, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	Estimated annual amortization expense of intangible assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2017 for each of the next five years is as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	The Company places a strong emphasis on controlling its costs and combats general price inflation by continuously improving its efficiency and operating performance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P176_S1	When the ongoing cost containment activities are not adequate, the Company takes actions to maintain its cost competitiveness.
103730_18_ITEM15_P177_S0	The Company incurred significant restructuring costs in its past to reduce its cost structure.
103730_18_ITEM15_P178_S0	Historically, the Company's primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P178_S1	Since 2013, the Company's cost reduction programs have primarily focused on reducing fixed costs, including selling, general, and administrative expenses.
103730_18_ITEM15_P179_S0	In 2013, the Company announced various cost reduction programs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P179_S1	These programs were substantially implemented by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016, with some additional costs and adjustments incurred in 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P179_S2	Many of the severance costs were recognized ratably over the required stay periods.
103730_18_ITEM15_P179_S3	In November 2016, the Company announced an extension of one of these programs, which was substantially completed as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P180_S0	In 2015, the Company announced additional global cost reduction programs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P180_S1	These programs included a facility closure in the Netherlands.
103730_18_ITEM15_P180_S2	These programs were substantially implemented as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P180_S3	The cash costs of these programs, primarily severance, aggregated to $31,740.
103730_18_ITEM15_P181_S0	The following table summarizes restructuring and related expenses which were recognized and reported on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:
103730_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	Over a period of approximately 2 years and in a period of discrete steps, the manufacture of wafers for a substantial share of products was transferred into a more cost-efficient fab.
103730_18_ITEM15_P182_S1	As a consequence, certain other manufacturing previously occurring in-house was transferred to third-party foundries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P182_S2	This transfer of production was substantially completed by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	Employees generally were required to remain with the Company during the production transfer period.
103730_18_ITEM15_P183_S1	Accordingly, the Company accrued these severance costs ratably over the respective employees' remaining service periods.
103730_18_ITEM15_P183_S2	The Company incurred other exit costs associated with the production transfer, including certain contract termination costs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	As a result of a review of the financial results and outlook for the Company's MOSFETs segment following the completion of the aforementioned production transfers, in November 2016, the Company determined to implement further cost reductions for the MOSFETs segment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	On November 7, 2016, the Company announced an extension of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
103730_18_ITEM15_P185_S1	The revised program included various cost reduction initiatives, primarily the transfer of all remaining manufacturing operations at its Santa Clara, California facility to other Vishay facilities or third-party subcontractors.
103730_18_ITEM15_P185_S2	The Company incurred cash charges of $7,248, primarily related to severance, to implement these additional steps.
103730_18_ITEM15_P185_S3	The total cash charges for the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program were $26,668.
103730_18_ITEM15_P185_S4	The Company expects to maintain its R D and management presence in the Silicon Valley area.
103730_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	Other exit costs of $958 and $5,763 are included in the expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016, respectively, in the table above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P187_S2	The entire amount of the liability is considered current and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	The voluntary separation / early retirement program was offered to employees worldwide who were eligible because they met job classification, age, and years-of-service criteria as of October 31, 2013.
103730_18_ITEM15_P188_S1	The program benefits varied by country and job classification, but generally included a cash loyalty bonus based on years of service.
103730_18_ITEM15_P188_S2	All employees eligible for the program have left the Company.
103730_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	These employees generally were not aligned with any particular segment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P189_S1	The effective separation / retirement date for most employees who accepted the offer was June 30, 2014 or earlier, with a few exceptions to allow for a transition period.
103730_18_ITEM15_P189_S2	The Company recorded $13,373 of expenses for this program, primarily in 2013 and 2014.
103730_18_ITEM15_P189_S3	Substantially all amounts related to this program have been paid as of December 31, 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	In an effort to reduce costs and streamline production of its module products within its Diodes segment, the Company committed to two smaller cost reduction programs related to the transferring of production of certain of its products.
103730_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	The Company recorded restructuring and severance costs of $2,080 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and an adjustment of $(463) during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to these production transfer programs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P191_S1	Substantially all amounts related to these programs were paid as of December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	The global cost reduction programs announced in 2015 included a plan to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs company-wide, and targeted streamlining and consolidation of production for certain product lines within its Capacitors and Resistors Inductors segments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	The following table summarizes the activity to date related to this program:
103730_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	The following table summarizes the expense recognized by segment related to this program:
103730_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	Severance benefits are generally paid in a lump sum at cessation of employment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P195_S1	Other exit costs of $577 are included in the expenses incurred in 2017 in the tables above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P195_S2	The current portion of the liability is $5,089 and is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
103730_18_ITEM15_P195_S3	The non-current portion of the liability is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
103730_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted in the United States.
103730_18_ITEM15_P196_S1	The TCJA represents sweeping changes in U.S. tax law.
103730_18_ITEM15_P196_S2	Among the numerous changes in tax law, the TCJA permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018; imposes a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings; establishes a participation exemption system by allowing a 100% dividends received deduction on qualifying dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries; limits deductions for net interest expense; and expands the U.S. taxation of foreign earned income to include "global intangible low-taxed income" ("GILTI").
103730_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	The TCJA represents the first significant change in U.S. tax law in over 30 years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	As permitted by SAB No. 118 (see Note 1), the tax expense recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the TCJA is considered "provisional," based on reasonable estimates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	The Company is continuing to collect and analyze detailed information about the earnings and profits of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, the related taxes paid, the amounts which could be repatriated, the foreign taxes which may be incurred on repatriation, and the associated impact of these items under the TCJA.
103730_18_ITEM15_P198_S2	The Company may record adjustments to refine those estimates during the measurement period, as additional analysis is completed.
103730_18_ITEM15_P198_S3	Furthermore, the Company is continuing to evaluate the TCJA's provisions and may prospectively adjust its financial structure and business practices accordingly.
103730_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	As a result of the TCJA, the Company recognized a provisional tax benefit of $74,816 to remeasure its net deferred tax liabilities at the lower, 21% rate.
103730_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	The TCJA transitions the U.S. from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.
103730_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	Under previous law, companies could indefinitely defer U.S. income taxation on unremitted foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM15_P201_S1	The TCJA imposes a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign earnings of 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets, payable in defined increments over eight years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P201_S2	As a result of this requirement, the Company recognized provisional tax expense of $215,558, and provisionally expects to pay $180,000, net of estimated applicable foreign tax credits, and after utilization of net operating loss and R D and FTC Credit carryforwards.
103730_18_ITEM15_P201_S3	These previously deferred foreign earnings may now be repatriated to the United States without additional U.S. federal taxation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P201_S4	However, any such repatriation could incur withholding and other foreign taxes in the source and intervening foreign jurisdictions, and certain U.S. state taxes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P202_S0	Due to the changes in taxation of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and also because of the need to finance the payment of the transition tax, the Company has made the determination during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 that certain unremitted foreign earnings in Israel, Germany, Austria, and France are no longer permanently reinvested, and has recorded provisional tax expense of $213,000 to accrue the incremental foreign income taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions assuming the hypothetical repatriation to the United States of these approximately $1,100,000 of available foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM15_P202_S1	Due to the existence of the foreign cash taxes payable at the source, the Company expects to actually repatriate these amounts at a measured pace over several years, and may decide to ultimately not repatriate some of these amounts.
103730_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	There are additional amounts of unremitted foreign earnings in other countries, which continue to be reinvested indefinitely, and the Company has made no provision for incremental foreign income taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions related to these amounts.
103730_18_ITEM15_P203_S1	Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred foreign tax liability for these amounts is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company recognized income tax, including U.S. federal and state income taxes, incremental foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions, on $300,000 of foreign earnings.
103730_18_ITEM15_P204_S1	This tax expense was recognized in 2015 following an evaluation of the Company's anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and the Company's most efficient use of liquidity, and with consideration of the amount of cash that could be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P204_S2	The Company repatriated $38,000 and $46,000 pursuant to this program in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P204_S3	Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, the related deferred tax liability for the 2015 repatriation plan was $118,887.
103730_18_ITEM15_P204_S4	The Company has terminated the 2015 cash repatriation plan and recorded a provisional income tax benefit to reverse this deferred tax liability, which was replaced by the liability for the transition tax and foreign income and withholding taxes described above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P205_S0	The deferred tax liability related to these unremitted foreign earnings is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each balance sheet date.
103730_18_ITEM15_P205_S1	Changes in these underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.

103730_18_ITEM15_P214_S1	The 2015 cash repatriation program was expected to occur over several years, and the deferred tax liability is based on the available sources of cash, applicable tax rates, and other factors and circumstances, as of each respective balance sheet date.
103730_18_ITEM15_P214_S2	Changes in the underlying facts and circumstances result in changes in the deferred tax liability balance, which are recorded as tax benefit or expense.
103730_18_ITEM15_P215_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the discrete items include $34,853 of additional tax expense related to the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan (see Notes 10 and 11), $8,704 (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions related largely to statute expiration, and $3,553 (tax benefit) for periodic remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the 2015 cash repatriation program described below.

103730_18_ITEM15_P216_S1	The 2015 cash repatriation program has been terminated and replaced as described under the heading "US Tax Reform: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," above .
103730_18_ITEM15_P216_S2	Discrete items for 2015 also include $8,888 (tax benefit) for changes in valuation allowances and $2,629 (tax benefit) for changes in uncertain tax positions.

103730_18_ITEM15_P221_S0	The following table summarizes changes in the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits:
103730_18_ITEM15_P222_S0	All of the unrecognized tax benefits of $17,056 and $16,805, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized.
103730_18_ITEM15_P223_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
103730_18_ITEM15_P223_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $2,845 and $1,638, respectively.

103730_18_ITEM15_P224_S2	The tax provision for those years includes adjustments related to the resolution of these matters, as reflected in the table above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P224_S3	The tax returns of other non-U.S. subsidiaries which are currently under examination include France (2015 through 2016), India (2004 through 2014), Italy (2012 through 2016), and Taiwan (2016).
103730_18_ITEM15_P224_S4	The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in other taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world, many of which are still open to examination.
103730_18_ITEM15_P225_S0	The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that result from such examinations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P225_S1	These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current unrecognized tax benefits.
103730_18_ITEM15_P225_S2	The Company believes that in the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations will conclude or the statutes of limitation on certain income tax periods open to examination will expire, or both.
103730_18_ITEM15_P225_S3	Given the uncertainties described above, the Company can only determine an estimate of potential decreases in unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $2,730 to $5,149.
103730_18_ITEM15_P226_S0	Long-term debt consists of the following:
103730_18_ITEM15_P227_S0	The Company maintains a credit facility with a consortium of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Credit Facility").
103730_18_ITEM15_P227_S1	On December 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate commitment of $640,000 of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020.
103730_18_ITEM15_P227_S2	The credit agreement initially became effective December 1, 2010 and was first amended and restated on August 8, 2013.
103730_18_ITEM15_P227_S3	The Credit Facility, as amended and restated, also provides for the ability of Vishay to request up to $50,000 of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P228_S0	Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
103730_18_ITEM15_P228_S1	The applicable interest margin is based on Vishay's leverage ratio.
103730_18_ITEM15_P229_S0	Based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.
103730_18_ITEM15_P229_S1	Vishay also pays a fee, also based on its leverage ratio, on undrawn amounts.
103730_18_ITEM15_P229_S2	The undrawn commitment fee, based on Vishay's current leverage ratio, is 0.35% per annum.
103730_18_ITEM15_P229_S3	The previous credit agreement required Vishay to pay facility fees on the entire commitment amount.
103730_18_ITEM15_P230_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
103730_18_ITEM15_P230_S1	If the Company's leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows such payments up to $75,000 per annum (subject to a cap of $225,000 for the term of the facility).
103730_18_ITEM15_P231_S0	The borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and general intangibles (but excluding real estate, intellectual property registered or licensed for use in, or arising under the laws of, any country other than the United States, assets located outside of the United States and deposit and securities accounts), of Vishay and certain significant subsidiaries located in the United States, and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries; and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries.

103730_18_ITEM15_P232_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility also removes certain restrictions related to intercompany transactions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P232_S1	These changes are expected to enable the Company to streamline its complex subsidiary structure and provide greater operating flexibility.
103730_18_ITEM15_P233_S0	The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal or interest, failure to pay or default under other material debt, material misrepresentation or breach of warranty, violation of certain covenants, a change of control, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the insolvency of Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries, and the rendering of a judgment in excess of $25,000 against Vishay or certain of its significant subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P233_S1	Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the Company's obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit facility terminated.
103730_18_ITEM15_P234_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $486,211 and $490,136, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.
103730_18_ITEM15_P234_S1	Letters of credit totaling $3,789 and $6,864 were outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P235_S0	Vishay currently has three issuances of convertible senior debentures outstanding with generally congruent terms.
103730_18_ITEM15_P235_S1	The quarterly cash dividend program of the Company results in adjustments to the conversion rate and effective conversion price for each issuance of the Company's convertible senior debentures effective as of the ex-dividend date of each cash dividend.
103730_18_ITEM15_P236_S0	The following table summarizes some key facts and terms regarding the three series of outstanding convertible senior debentures following the adjustment made to the conversion rate of the debentures on the ex-dividend date of the December 21, 2017 dividend payment:
103730_18_ITEM15_P237_S0	Prior to three months before the maturity date, the holders may only convert their debentures under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter after the first full quarter subsequent to issuance, if the sale price of Vishay common stock reaches 130% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price of the debentures falls below 98% of the product of the sale price of Vishay's common stock and the conversion rate for a specified period; (3) Vishay calls any or all of the debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S0	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2016 evaluation of the conversion criteria, remained convertible subsequent to the April 1, 2017, July 1, 2017, and September 30, 2017 evaluations, and remain convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2017 evaluation due to the sale price of Vishay's common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 and first, second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S1	The convertible debentures due 2040 became convertible subsequent to the September 30, 2017 evaluation of the conversion criteria, and remain convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2017 evaluation due to the sale price of Vishay's common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S2	The debentures due 2040 and due 2042 will remain convertible until March 31, 2018, at which time the conversion criteria will be reevaluated.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S3	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon future conversion of any of the convertible senior debentures, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S4	The excess of the amount that the Company would pay to the holders of the debentures due 2040 and due 2042 upon conversion over the carrying value of the liability component of the debentures currently convertible has been reclassified as temporary equity on the consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S5	The Company intends to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under its credit facility.
103730_18_ITEM15_P238_S6	Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible debentures due 2040 and due 2042 continues to be classified as a non-current liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P239_S0	Vishay must provide additional shares upon conversion if there is a "fundamental change" in the business as defined in the indenture governing the debentures.
103730_18_ITEM15_P240_S0	Vishay may not redeem the debentures prior to the respective call dates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P240_S1	On or after the call date and prior to the maturity date, Vishay may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of Vishay's common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period prior to the date on which Vishay provides notice of redemption.
103730_18_ITEM15_P241_S0	GAAP requires an issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods.
103730_18_ITEM15_P241_S1	The resulting discount on the debt is amortized as non-cash interest expense in future periods.
103730_18_ITEM15_P242_S0	The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the convertible debentures are reflected in the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheets as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P243_S0	Interest is payable on the debentures semi-annually at the cash coupon rate; however, the remaining debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using an effective annual interest rate equal to the Company's estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P243_S1	In addition to ordinary interest, contingent interest will accrue in certain circumstances relating to the trading price of the debentures and under certain other circumstances beginning ten years subsequent to issuance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P244_S0	Interest expense related to the debentures is reflected on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
103730_18_ITEM15_P245_S0	On December 13, 2002, Vishay issued $105,000 in nominal (or principal) amount of its floating rate unsecured exchangeable notes due 2102 in connection with an acquisition.
103730_18_ITEM15_P245_S1	The notes were governed by a note instrument and a put and call agreement dated December 13, 2002.
103730_18_ITEM15_P245_S2	The notes could be put to Vishay in exchange for shares of its common stock and, under certain circumstances, could be called by Vishay for similar consideration.

103730_18_ITEM15_P246_S2	Vishay recognized gains on early extinguishment of debt of $4,597 presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P247_S0	Following the June 28, 2016 transaction, no exchangeable unsecured notes are outstanding.
103730_18_ITEM15_P248_S0	Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt, based on the terms stated in the respective agreements, are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P249_S0	The annual maturities of long-term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P249_S1	Accordingly, the discounts associated with the convertible debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042 are excluded from the calculation of the annual maturities of long-term debt in the table above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P250_S0	At December 31, 2017, the Company had committed and uncommitted short-term credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks aggregating approximately $15,000, with substantially no amounts borrowed.

103730_18_ITEM15_P253_S0	See Note 18 for further discussion on the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
103730_18_ITEM15_P254_S0	The Company's Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share while the common stock carries 1 vote per share.
103730_18_ITEM15_P254_S1	Class B shares are transferable only to certain permitted transferees while the common stock is freely transferable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P254_S2	Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis at any time into shares of common stock.
103730_18_ITEM15_P254_S3	Transfers of Class B shares other than to permitted transferees result in the automatic conversion of the Class B shares into common stock.
103730_18_ITEM15_P255_S0	The Board of Directors may only declare dividends or other distributions with respect to the common stock or the Class B common stock if it grants such dividends or distributions in the same amount per share with respect to the other class of stock.
103730_18_ITEM15_P255_S1	Stock dividends or distributions on any class of stock are payable only in shares of stock of that class.
103730_18_ITEM15_P255_S2	Shares of either common stock or Class B common stock cannot be split, divided, or combined unless the other is also split, divided, or combined equally.
103730_18_ITEM15_P256_S0	In 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program.
103730_18_ITEM15_P256_S1	Cash dividends were paid quarterly in 2017 and 2016 as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P257_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends and share repurchases, provided the Company's pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.

103730_18_ITEM15_P259_S1	The Company has reserved adequate shares to ensure it could issue the maximum amount of shares to be delivered upon a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the debentures.
103730_18_ITEM15_P260_S0	The caption "Other" on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations consists of the following:

103730_18_ITEM15_P261_S1	The $7,060 loss recorded in March 2017 included Vishay's proportionate share of the investee's accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1,110, recognized upon discontinuation of the equity investment, and the estimated cost of certain contingencies pending resolution related to the investee.
103730_18_ITEM15_P261_S2	In December 2017, the remaining contingencies related to the investee were favorably resolved and the Company reduced the loss by $948.
103730_18_ITEM15_P261_S3	The loss on disposal is not deductible for income tax purposes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P262_S0	On August 12, 2015, a major explosion occurred in the port of Tianjin, China.
103730_18_ITEM15_P262_S1	Vishay owns and operates a diodes manufacturing facility in Tianjin near the port.
103730_18_ITEM15_P262_S2	The shockwave of the explosion resulted in some damage to the facility and caused a temporary shutdown.

103730_18_ITEM15_P265_S0	During 2016, the Company received proceeds totaling $13,406 under its various insurance policies, of which $4,911 is classified as proceeds from the sale of property and equipment on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, and the remainder is considered cash flows from operating activities.
103730_18_ITEM15_P265_S1	The Company recorded, as a separate line on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, a gain of $8,809, equal to the proceeds received less the costs incurred for inventory, property, and equipment damage (at net book value) and related repair and clean-up costs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P266_S0	Other accrued expenses consist of the following:
103730_18_ITEM15_P267_S0	The cumulative balance of each component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the income tax effects allocated to each component are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P268_S0	Reclassifications of pension and other post-retirement actuarial items out of AOCI, including the recognition of the settlement charge for the termination of the Vishay Retirement Plan in 2016, are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 11).
103730_18_ITEM15_P269_S0	Historically, valuation allowances were recorded against the deferred taxes associated with certain unrecognized pension and other postretirement actuarial items.
103730_18_ITEM15_P269_S1	Changes in estimates related to these valuation allowances are recorded in the statement of operations and do not affect accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying pension or other postretirement benefit plan is extinguished.
103730_18_ITEM15_P269_S2	As a result of the termination and settlement of the Vishay Retirement Plan, the Company recorded $34,853 of additional income tax expense and the related reclassification adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income related to changes in estimates recorded in 2010.
103730_18_ITEM15_P270_S0	The amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of securities held by the Company's rabbi trust used to fund a deferred compensation plan was $817, $0, and $680 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P270_S1	These reclassifications are recorded as a component of compensation expense within Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P271_S0	The pre-tax amount of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reclassified out of AOCI as a result of sales of available-for-sale securities was $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

103730_18_ITEM15_P271_S2	The tax effect of the reclassifications of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities is recorded as a component of Income Tax Expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P272_S0	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes Vishay's proportionate share of other comprehensive income (loss) of nonconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method.
103730_18_ITEM15_P273_S0	The Company maintains various retirement benefit plans.
103730_18_ITEM15_P274_S0	GAAP requires employers to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, in its balance sheet.
103730_18_ITEM15_P274_S1	The recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet requires employers to recognize actuarial items (such as actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and transition obligations) as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax.
103730_18_ITEM15_P275_S0	The following table summarizes amounts recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets associated with these various retirement benefit plans:
103730_18_ITEM15_P276_S0	* - Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in this table pre-tax.
103730_18_ITEM15_P277_S0	The Company maintained several defined benefit pension plans which covered most full-time U.S. employees.
103730_18_ITEM15_P277_S1	These included pension plans which are "qualified" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code, and "non-qualified" pension plans which provide defined benefits primarily to U.S. employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_18_ITEM15_P278_S0	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P279_S0	The Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee issued updated mortality improvement scales in 2017 and 2016, which did not have a material effect on the Company's projected benefit obligations or future net periodic pension cost.
103730_18_ITEM15_P280_S0	The qualified U.S. pension plans historically included both contributory and non-contributory plans.
103730_18_ITEM15_P280_S1	The Company's principal qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Retirement Plan) was funded through Company and participant contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.
103730_18_ITEM15_P280_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans, which were assumed as a result of past acquisitions, were funded only through Company contributions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P281_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_18_ITEM15_P281_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees could participate in the plan, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits accrued after December 31, 2008.
103730_18_ITEM15_P281_S2	The Company's other qualified U.S. pension plans had all been effectively frozen in prior years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P281_S3	All of the Company's qualified U.S. pension plans were merged into the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S0	In the second fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company began the process of terminating the Vishay Retirement Plan.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S1	During the third fiscal quarter of 2016, the Company received a favorable determination letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and met all other applicable IRS and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation requirements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S2	The termination and settlement occurred in December 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S3	Plan participants had their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S4	The settlement resulted in a non-cash charge of $79,321 to recognize the unrecognized actuarial items related to the Vishay Retirement Plan recorded in 2016 in accumulated other comprehensive income.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S5	These non-cash charges are presented on a separate line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S6	The termination and settlement required no additional cash contributions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P282_S7	Excess plan assets were transferred to a qualified defined contribution retirement plan, and are presented on the accompanying reconciliation as a negative Company contribution.
103730_18_ITEM15_P283_S0	A final reconciliation of participant data subject to the settlement annuity contract was completed during the second fiscal quarter of 2017.
103730_18_ITEM15_P284_S0	The final annuity pricing adjustment and related items did not have a material impact on the Company's financial results.
103730_18_ITEM15_P285_S0	The Company's principal non-qualified U.S. pension plan (the Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan) was a contributory pension plan designed to provide similar defined benefits to covered U.S. employees whose benefits under the Vishay Retirement Plan would be limited by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
103730_18_ITEM15_P285_S1	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan was identical in construction to the Vishay Retirement Plan, except that the plan is not qualified under ERISA.
103730_18_ITEM15_P286_S0	The Vishay Non-qualified Retirement Plan, like all non-qualified plans, is considered to be unfunded.
103730_18_ITEM15_P286_S1	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_18_ITEM15_P286_S2	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_18_ITEM15_P286_S3	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P286_S4	Assets held in trust related to the non-qualified pension plan were $24,505 and $22,896 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P287_S0	In 2008, the Company adopted amendments to the Vishay Non-Qualified Retirement Plan such that effective January 1, 2009, the plan was frozen.
103730_18_ITEM15_P287_S1	Pursuant to these amendments, no new employees may participate in the plans, no further participant contributions were required or permitted, and no further benefits shall accrue after December 31, 2008.
103730_18_ITEM15_P287_S2	Benefits accumulated as of December 31, 2008 will be paid to employees upon retirement, and the Company will likely need to make additional cash contributions to the rabbi trust to fund this accumulated benefit obligation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P287_S3	To mitigate the loss in benefits of these employees, effective January 1, 2009, the Company increased the Company-match portion of its 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for employees impacted by the pension freeze.
103730_18_ITEM15_P288_S0	The Company also maintains other pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits primarily to former U.S. employees whose benefits under qualified pension plans were limited by ERISA.
103730_18_ITEM15_P288_S1	These non-qualified plans are all non-contributory plans, and are considered to be unfunded.
103730_18_ITEM15_P289_S0	In 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Felix Zandman, its Executive Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer.
103730_18_ITEM15_P289_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is providing an annual retirement benefit of approximately $614 to his surviving spouse.
103730_18_ITEM15_P289_S2	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund benefit payments under this plan.
103730_18_ITEM15_P289_S3	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_18_ITEM15_P289_S4	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P289_S5	Assets held in trust related to this non-qualified pension plan were $1,789 and $2,389 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P290_S0	The Company provides pension and similar benefits to employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries consistent with local practices.
103730_18_ITEM15_P290_S1	Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P291_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and funded status related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans:
103730_18_ITEM15_P292_S0	The plan assets are stated at fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P292_S1	See Note 18 for further discussion of the valuation of the plan assets.

103730_18_ITEM15_P295_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the projected and accumulated benefit obligations:
103730_18_ITEM15_P296_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension cost:
103730_18_ITEM15_P297_S0	Net periodic benefit cost in 2017 was significantly impacted by the termination and settlement of the Company's qualified U.S. pension plan in December 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P297_S1	The settlement resulted in the immediate recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial items related to the plan in 2016 that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and were being amortized into net periodic pension cost.
103730_18_ITEM15_P298_S0	See Note 10 for the pretax, tax effect and after tax amounts included in other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
103730_18_ITEM15_P298_S1	The estimated actuarial items for the defined benefit pensions plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during 2017 is $7,300.
103730_18_ITEM15_P299_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_18_ITEM15_P300_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic pension costs:
103730_18_ITEM15_P301_S0	The plans' expected return on assets is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.
103730_18_ITEM15_P301_S1	In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, advice from pension consultants and investment advisors, and current economic and capital market conditions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S0	The investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities, and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities and is adjusted for the expected duration of the obligation and the funded status of the plan.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S1	Investment allocations are made across a range of securities, maturities and credit quality.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S2	The Company's non-U.S. defined benefit plan investments are based on local laws and customs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S3	Most plans invest in cash and local government fixed income securities, although plans in certain countries have investments in equity securities.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S4	The plans do not invest in securities of Vishay or its subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S5	Negative investment returns could ultimately affect the funded status of the plans, requiring additional cash contributions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P302_S6	See Note 18 for further information on the fair value of the plan assets by asset category.
103730_18_ITEM15_P303_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P304_S0	The Company's anticipated 2017 contributions for defined benefit pension plans will approximate the expected benefit payments disclosed above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P305_S0	In the U.S., the Company maintains unfunded non-pension postretirement plans, including medical benefits for certain executives and their surviving spouses, which are funded as costs are incurred.
103730_18_ITEM15_P305_S1	The Company also maintains two unfunded non-pension postretirement plans at two European subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P306_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the benefit obligation, plan assets, and accrued benefit cost related to U.S. and non-U.S. non-pension defined benefit postretirement plans:
103730_18_ITEM15_P307_S0	Amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:
103730_18_ITEM15_P308_S0	Actuarial items consist of the following:
103730_18_ITEM15_P309_S0	The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost:
103730_18_ITEM15_P310_S0	The estimated actuarial items for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 are not material.
103730_18_ITEM15_P311_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of the respective years:
103730_18_ITEM15_P312_S0	The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit costs:
103730_18_ITEM15_P313_S0	The impact of a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation is not material.
103730_18_ITEM15_P314_S0	Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P315_S0	As the plans are unfunded, the Company's anticipated contributions for 2017 are equal to its estimated benefits payments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P316_S0	The Company participates in various other defined contribution and government-mandated retirement plans based on local law or custom.
103730_18_ITEM15_P316_S1	The Company periodically makes required contributions for certain of these plans, whereas other plans are unfunded retirement bonus plans which will be paid at the employee's retirement date.
103730_18_ITEM15_P316_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include $13,852 and $11,497, respectively, within accrued pension and other postretirement costs related to these plans.
103730_18_ITEM15_P317_S0	The Company's U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which provides for Company matching contributions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P317_S1	The Company's matching expense for the plans was $5,843, $5,039, and $5,369 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

103730_18_ITEM15_P318_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, these employees could defer a portion of their compensation until retirement, or elect shorter deferral periods.
103730_18_ITEM15_P318_S2	The Company maintains a liability within other noncurrent liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets related to these deferrals.
103730_18_ITEM15_P318_S3	The Company maintains a non-qualified trust, referred to as a "rabbi" trust, to fund payments under this plan.
103730_18_ITEM15_P318_S4	Rabbi trust assets are subject to creditor claims under certain conditions and are not the property of employees.
103730_18_ITEM15_P318_S5	Therefore, they are accounted for as other noncurrent assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P318_S6	Assets held in trust related to the deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $18,958 and $16,632, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P319_S0	The Company has various stockholder-approved programs which allow for the grant of share-based compensation to officers, employees, and non-employee directors.
103730_18_ITEM15_P320_S0	The amount of compensation cost related to stock-based payment transactions is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.
103730_18_ITEM15_P320_S1	The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
103730_18_ITEM15_P321_S0	The Company determines compensation cost for restricted stock units ("RSUs"), phantom stock units, and restricted stock based on the grant-date fair value of the underlying common stock adjusted for expected dividends paid over the required vesting period for non-participating awards.
103730_18_ITEM15_P321_S1	Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an officer, employee, or non-employee director provides service in exchange for the award.

103730_18_ITEM15_P328_S0	Each RSU entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock when the RSU vests.
103730_18_ITEM15_P329_S0	RSU activity is presented below (number of RSUs in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM15_P330_S0	The number of RSUs vested includes shares that the Company withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements.

103730_18_ITEM15_P333_S1	In the event of voluntary termination by the executive prior to attaining retirement age or termination for cause, the executive's outstanding RSUs and performance-based RSUs will be forfeited.
103730_18_ITEM15_P334_S0	The 2007 Program authorizes the grant of phantom stock units to the extent provided for in the Company's employment agreements with certain executives.
103730_18_ITEM15_P334_S1	Each phantom stock unit entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock at the individual's termination of employment or any other future date specified in the applicable employment agreement.
103730_18_ITEM15_P334_S2	Phantom stock units participate in dividend distribution on the same basis as the Company's common stock and Class B common stock.

103730_18_ITEM15_P340_S0	The Company uses various leased facilities and equipment in its operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P340_S1	In the normal course of business, operating leases are generally renewed or replaced by other leases.
103730_18_ITEM15_P340_S2	Certain operating leases include escalation clauses.
103730_18_ITEM15_P341_S0	Total rental expense under operating leases was $29,039, $27,431, and $27,210 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P342_S0	Future minimum lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:
103730_18_ITEM15_P343_S0	The Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials.
103730_18_ITEM15_P343_S1	The Company's manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P344_S0	Complying with current laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.
103730_18_ITEM15_P345_S0	The Company has engaged environmental consultants and attorneys to assist management in evaluating potential liabilities related to environmental matters.
103730_18_ITEM15_P345_S1	Management assesses the input from these consultants along with other information known to the Company in its effort to continually monitor these potential liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM15_P345_S2	Such assessments include the Company's share of remediation costs, information known to the Company concerning the size of the hazardous waste sites, their years of operation, and the number of past users and their financial viability.
103730_18_ITEM15_P346_S0	The Company has accrued environmental liabilities of $13,307, of which $4,727 is included in other accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and $8,580 is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
103730_18_ITEM15_P347_S0	While the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined, management does not believe that the final disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
103730_18_ITEM15_P348_S0	The Company's present and past facilities have been in operation for many years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P348_S1	These facilities have used substances and have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous.
103730_18_ITEM15_P348_S2	Therefore, it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future, which the Company cannot now predict.
103730_18_ITEM15_P349_S0	The Company is a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.
103730_18_ITEM15_P349_S1	The Company is of the opinion that these litigations or claims will not have a material negative effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
103730_18_ITEM15_P350_S0	The Company's Siliconix subsidiary maintains long-term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front-end capacity.
103730_18_ITEM15_P351_S0	Since 2004, Siliconix has maintained long-term foundry arrangements for semiconductor manufacturing with Tower Semiconductor, pursuant to which Siliconix transferred certain technology to Tower Semiconductor and committed to purchase a minimum amount of semiconductor wafers.
103730_18_ITEM15_P351_S1	The Company has minimum purchase commitments pursuant to the current arrangement of $41,166 and $15,758 for 2018 and 2019, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P351_S2	The minimum purchase commitments are based on a 18-month rolling forecast and, accordingly, the 2019 minimum purchase commitments will likely increase.
103730_18_ITEM15_P351_S3	The Company has the option to purchase wafers in addition to the minimum commitment and, accordingly, actual purchases may be different than the amounts disclosed above.
103730_18_ITEM15_P351_S4	The Company's 2017 purchases pursuant to the arrangement exceeded the minimum purchase commitment.
103730_18_ITEM15_P352_S0	The Company is a party to various product quality claims in the normal course of business.
103730_18_ITEM15_P352_S1	The Company provides warranties for its products which offer replacement of defective products.
103730_18_ITEM15_P352_S2	Annual warranty expenses are generally not significant.
103730_18_ITEM15_P353_S0	The Company periodically receives claims which arise from consequential damages which result from a customer's installation of an alleged defective Vishay component into the customer's product.
103730_18_ITEM15_P353_S1	Although not covered by its stated warranty, Vishay may occasionally reimburse the customer for these consequential damages.
103730_18_ITEM15_P354_S0	The Company has employment agreements with certain of its senior executives.
103730_18_ITEM15_P354_S1	These employment agreements provide incremental compensation in the event of termination.
103730_18_ITEM15_P354_S2	The Company does not provide any severance or other benefits specifically upon a change in control.
103730_18_ITEM15_P355_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues, a material portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the worldwide industrial, automotive, telecommunications, and computing markets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P355_S1	These markets have historically experienced wide variations in demand for end products.
103730_18_ITEM15_P355_S2	If demand for these end products should decrease, the producers thereof could reduce their purchases of the Company's products, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
103730_18_ITEM15_P356_S0	While no single customer comprises greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues, certain subsidiaries and product lines have customers which comprise greater than 10% of the subsidiary's or product line's net revenues.
103730_18_ITEM15_P356_S1	The loss of one of these customers could have a material effect on the results of operations of the subsidiary or product line and financial position of the subsidiary, which could result in an impairment charge which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P357_S0	Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P357_S1	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are generally limited due to the Company's large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P357_S2	As of December 31, 2017, one customer comprised 16.1% of the Company's accounts receivable balance.
103730_18_ITEM15_P357_S3	This customer comprised 15.4% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P357_S4	No other customer comprised greater than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P358_S0	The Company continually monitors the credit risks associated with its accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly.
103730_18_ITEM15_P358_S1	The credit risk exposure associated with the accounts receivable is limited by the allowance and is not considered material to the financial statements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P359_S0	The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with various major financial institutions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P359_S1	The Company is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are concentrated.
103730_18_ITEM15_P359_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the following financial institutions held over 10% of the Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance:
103730_18_ITEM15_P360_S0	Many of the Company's products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers.
103730_18_ITEM15_P360_S1	The Company's consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if there are significant price increases for these raw materials, the Company has difficulty obtaining these raw materials, or the quality of available raw materials deteriorates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P360_S2	For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, the Company may be unable to pass on the increased cost to the Company's customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used.
103730_18_ITEM15_P360_S3	For periods in which the prices are declining, the Company may be required to write down its inventory carrying cost of these raw materials which, depending on the extent of the difference between market price and its carrying cost, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net earnings.
103730_18_ITEM15_P361_S0	Vishay is a major consumer of the world's annual production of tantalum.
103730_18_ITEM15_P362_S0	Tantalum, a metal purchased in powder or wire form, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors.
103730_18_ITEM15_P362_S1	There are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder.
103730_18_ITEM15_P363_S0	From time to time, there have been short-term market shortages of raw materials utilized by the Company.
103730_18_ITEM15_P363_S1	While these shortages have not historically adversely affected the Company's ability to increase production of products containing these raw materials, they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for the Company.
103730_18_ITEM15_P363_S2	The Company cannot assure that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect the Company's ability to increase production, particularly during periods of growing demand for the Company's products.
103730_18_ITEM15_P364_S0	Certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, such as gold, copper, palladium, and other metals, are traded on active markets and can be subject to significant price volatility.
103730_18_ITEM15_P364_S1	To ensure adequate supply and to provide cost certainty, the Company's policy is to enter into short-term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of the raw materials utilized by the Company if market prices decline below budget.
103730_18_ITEM15_P364_S2	If after entering into these commitments, the market prices for these raw materials decline, the Company must recognize losses on these adverse purchase commitments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P365_S0	Recently enacted rules in the U.S. on conflict minerals, which include tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold, all of which are used in the Company's products, could result in increased prices and decreased supply of conflict minerals, which could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P366_S0	The Company has operations outside the United States, and approximately 77% of revenues earned during 2017 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States.
103730_18_ITEM15_P366_S1	Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, $1,282,120 of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by subsidiaries outside of the United States.
103730_18_ITEM15_P367_S0	Some of the Company's products are produced and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in countries which are subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability.
103730_18_ITEM15_P367_S1	This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest.
103730_18_ITEM15_P367_S2	These conditions could have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition, operating results, and ability to access its liquidity when needed.
103730_18_ITEM15_P368_S0	As of December 31, 2017 the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were concentrated in the following countries:
103730_18_ITEM15_P369_S0	Certain of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments deposited in U.S. financial institutions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P370_S0	Vishay has been in operation in Israel for 47 years.
103730_18_ITEM15_P370_S1	The Company has never experienced any material interruption in its operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars.
103730_18_ITEM15_P371_S0	Vishay is a global manufacturer and supplier of electronic components.
103730_18_ITEM15_P371_S1	Vishay operates, and its chief operating decision maker makes strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on, five reporting segments: MOSFETs, Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors Inductors, and Capacitors.
103730_18_ITEM15_P371_S2	These segments represent groupings of product lines based on their functionality:
103730_18_ITEM15_P372_S0	Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ("MOSFETs") function as solid state switches to control power.
103730_18_ITEM15_P373_S0	Diodes route, regulate, and block radio frequency, analog, and power signals; protect systems from surges or electrostatic discharge damage; or provide electromagnetic interference filtering.
103730_18_ITEM15_P374_S0	Optoelectronic components emit light, detect light, or do both.
103730_18_ITEM15_P375_S0	Resistors and inductors both impede electric current.
103730_18_ITEM15_P376_S0	Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current.
103730_18_ITEM15_P377_S0	Inductors use an internal magnetic field to change alternating current phase and resist alternating current.
103730_18_ITEM15_P378_S0	Capacitors store energy and discharge it when needed.
103730_18_ITEM15_P379_S0	Vishay's reporting segments generate substantially all of their revenue from product sales to the industrial, automotive, telecommunications, computing, consumer products, power supplies, military and aerospace, and medical end markets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P379_S1	A small portion of revenues are from royalties.
103730_18_ITEM15_P380_S0	The Company evaluates business segment performance on operating income, exclusive of certain items ("segment operating income").
103730_18_ITEM15_P380_S1	Only dedicated, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income.
103730_18_ITEM15_P380_S2	The Company's calculation of segment operating income excludes such selling, general, and administrative costs as global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups, as well as restructuring and severance costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and other items.
103730_18_ITEM15_P380_S3	Management believes that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company.
103730_18_ITEM15_P380_S4	These items represent reconciling items between segment operating income and consolidated operating income.
103730_18_ITEM15_P381_S0	Business segment assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.
103730_18_ITEM15_P382_S0	The Company also regularly evaluates gross profit by segment to assist in the analysis of consolidated gross profit.
103730_18_ITEM15_P382_S1	The Company considers segment operating income to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business operations of the segments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P383_S0	The following tables set forth business segment information:
103730_18_ITEM15_P384_S0	See Note 4 for restructuring and severance costs segment information.
103730_18_ITEM15_P385_S0	The following table summarizes net revenues based on revenues generated by subsidiaries located within the identified geographic area:
103730_18_ITEM15_P386_S0	The following table summarizes property and equipment based on physical location:
103730_18_ITEM15_P387_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
103730_18_ITEM15_P387_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units (see Note 12), convertible debt instruments (see Note 6), and other potentially dilutive securities.
103730_18_ITEM15_P388_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Vishay stockholders (shares in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM15_P389_S0	Diluted earnings per share for the years presented do not reflect the following weighted average potential common shares, as the effect would be antidilutive (in thousands) :
103730_18_ITEM15_P390_S0	In periods in which they are dilutive, if the potential common shares related to the exchangeable notes are included in the computation, the related interest savings, net of tax, assuming conversion/exchange is added to the net earnings used to compute earnings per share.
103730_18_ITEM15_P391_S0	The Company's convertible debt instruments are only convertible for specified periods upon the occurrence of certain events.
103730_18_ITEM15_P391_S1	The convertible debentures due 2042 became convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2016 evaluation of the conversion criteria, remained convertible subsequent to the April 1, 2017, July 1, 2017, and September 30, 2017 evaluations, and remain convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2017 evaluation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P391_S2	The convertible debentures due 2040 became convertible subsequent to the September 30, 2017 evaluation of the conversion criteria and remain convertible subsequent to the December 31, 2017 evaluation.
103730_18_ITEM15_P391_S3	In periods that the debentures are not convertible, the certain conditions which could trigger conversion of the remaining debentures have been deemed to be non-substantive, and accordingly, the Company assumes the conversion of these instruments in its diluted earnings per share computation during periods in which they are dilutive.
103730_18_ITEM15_P392_S0	At the direction of its Board of Directors, the Company intends, upon conversion, to repay the principal amounts of the convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of Vishay common stock.
103730_18_ITEM15_P392_S1	Accordingly, the debentures are included in the diluted earnings per share computation using the "treasury stock method" (similar to options and warrants) rather than the "if converted method" otherwise required for convertible debt.
103730_18_ITEM15_P392_S2	Under the "treasury stock method," Vishay calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the debentures based on the average market price of Vishay common stock during the period, and that number is included in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
103730_18_ITEM15_P392_S3	If the average market price is less than $12.95, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2040, if the average market price is less than $17.75, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2041, and if the average market price is less than $11.02, no shares are included in the diluted earnings per share computation for the convertible senior debentures due 2042.
103730_18_ITEM15_P393_S0	Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of businesses acquired consists of the following :
103730_18_ITEM15_P394_S0	The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy of the inputs used to measure fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P394_S1	This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
103730_18_ITEM15_P394_S2	The following is a brief description of those three levels:
103730_18_ITEM15_P395_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
103730_18_ITEM15_P396_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
103730_18_ITEM15_P396_S1	These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
103730_18_ITEM15_P397_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions.
103730_18_ITEM15_P398_S0	An asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
103730_18_ITEM15_P399_S0	The following table provides the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:
103730_18_ITEM15_P400_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-20, and as described in Note 3, the Company performed nonrecurring fair value measurements of its indefinite-lived Siliconix tradenames as of the last day of its third fiscal quarter of 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P400_S1	As a result of the fair value measurements, the Siliconix tradenames with a carrying value of $20,359 were written down to their fair value of $18,800, resulting in an impairment charge of $1,559, recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P401_S0	The Company's nonrecurring fair value measurement of its Siliconix tradenames is considered Level 3 measurements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P401_S1	See Note 3 for further information on the measurements and inputs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P402_S0	The Company maintains non-qualified trusts, referred to as "rabbi" trusts, to fund payments under deferred compensation and non-qualified pension plans.
103730_18_ITEM15_P402_S1	Rabbi trust assets consist primarily of marketable securities, classified as available-for-sale, and company-owned life insurance assets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P402_S2	The marketable securities held in the rabbi trusts are valued using quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P402_S3	The company-owned life insurance assets are valued in consultation with the Company's insurance brokers using the value of underlying assets of the insurance contracts.
103730_18_ITEM15_P402_S4	The fair value measurement of the marketable securities held in the rabbi trust is considered a Level 1 measurement and the measurement of the company-owned life insurance assets is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_18_ITEM15_P403_S0	The Company maintains defined benefit retirement plans in certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries.
103730_18_ITEM15_P403_S1	The assets of the plans are measured at fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P404_S0	Equity securities held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of equity securities that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P404_S1	The fair value measurement of the equity securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_18_ITEM15_P405_S0	Fixed income securities held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consist of government bonds in the Philippines and India and corporate notes that are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P405_S1	The fair value measurement of the fixed income securities is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_18_ITEM15_P406_S0	Cash held by the non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans consists of demand deposits on account in various financial institutions to fund current benefit payments.
103730_18_ITEM15_P406_S1	The carrying amount of the cash approximates its fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P407_S0	The Company holds available for sale investments in debt securities that are intended to fund a portion of its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations outside of the U.S.
103730_18_ITEM15_P407_S1	The investments are valued based on quoted market prices on the last business day of the year.
103730_18_ITEM15_P407_S2	The fair value measurement of the investments is considered a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_18_ITEM15_P408_S0	The convertible senior debentures, due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, issued by the Company on November 9, 2010, May 13, 2011, and May 31, 2012, respectively, contain embedded derivative features that GAAP requires to be bifurcated and remeasured each reporting period.
103730_18_ITEM15_P408_S1	Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative features, if any, is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
103730_18_ITEM15_P409_S0	The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative features.
103730_18_ITEM15_P409_S1	Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company's current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility, and the debentures' credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
103730_18_ITEM15_P409_S2	The first three aforementioned inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two aforementioned inputs are unobservable and thus require management's judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P410_S0	The fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_18_ITEM15_P411_S0	The Company enters into forward contracts with highly-rated financial institutions to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the legal entity's functional currency.
103730_18_ITEM15_P411_S1	The notional amount of the forward contracts was $100,000 and $100,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P411_S2	The forward contracts are short-term in nature and are expected to be renewed at the Company's discretion until the intercompany loans are repaid.
103730_18_ITEM15_P411_S3	We have not designated the forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and as such the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense).
103730_18_ITEM15_P411_S4	The Company estimates the fair value of the forward contracts based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using current market information and is considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
103730_18_ITEM15_P411_S5	Due to the timing of the renewal of the forward contracts, the value of the forward contracts were immaterial as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
103730_18_ITEM15_P412_S0	The Company does not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
103730_18_ITEM15_P413_S0	The fair value of the long-term debt, excluding the derivative liability and capitalized deferred financing costs, at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is approximately $1,071,200 and $860,600, respectively, compared to its carrying value, excluding the derivative liability and capitalized deferred financing costs, of $379,033 and $367,049, respectively.
103730_18_ITEM15_P413_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using a combination of quoted market prices for similar financing arrangements and expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates, which are considered level 2 inputs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P414_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's short-term investments were comprised of time deposits with financial institutions that have maturities that exceed 90 days from the date of acquisition; however they all mature within one year from the respective balance sheet dates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P414_S1	The Company's short-term investments are accounted for as held-to-maturity debt instruments, at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value.
103730_18_ITEM15_P414_S2	The investments are funded with excess cash not expected to be needed for operations prior to maturity; therefore, the Company believes it has the intent and ability to hold the short-term investments until maturity.
103730_18_ITEM15_P415_S0	At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary.
103730_18_ITEM15_P415_S1	No other-than-temporary impairments have been recognized on these securities, and there are no unrecognized holding gains or losses for these securities during the periods presented.
103730_18_ITEM15_P415_S2	There have been no transfers to or from the held-to-maturity classification.
103730_18_ITEM15_P415_S3	All decreases in the account balance are due to returns of principal at the securities' maturity dates.
103730_18_ITEM15_P416_S0	Interest on the securities is recognized as interest income when earned.
103730_18_ITEM15_P417_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were comprised of demand deposits, time deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased, and money market funds.
103730_18_ITEM15_P417_S1	The Company estimates the fair value of its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments using level 2 inputs.
103730_18_ITEM15_P417_S2	Based on the current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity, the fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity short-term investments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
103730_18_ITEM15_P418_S0	The Company's financial instruments also include accounts receivable, short-term notes payable, and accounts payable.
103730_18_ITEM15_P418_S1	The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values.
103730_18_ITEM15_P419_S0	On July 6, 2010, Vishay completed the spin-off of its measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company, Vishay Precision Group, Inc.
103730_18_ITEM15_P419_S1	Vishay's common stockholders received 1 share of VPG common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay common stock they held on the record date, June 25, 2010, and Vishay's Class B common stockholders received 1 share of VPG Class B common stock for every 14 shares of Vishay Class B common stock they held on the record date.

103730_18_ITEM15_P422_S0	In connection with the completion of the spin-off, Vishay and its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with VPG and its subsidiaries that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off.
103730_18_ITEM15_P422_S1	Among the agreements entered into with VPG and its subsidiaries were a transition services agreement, several lease agreements, and supply agreements.
103730_18_ITEM15_P422_S2	None of the agreements have had nor are expected to have a material impact on Vishay's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
103730_18_ITEM15_P422_S3	Some of these agreements have expired and have not been renewed.
103730_18_ITEM15_P423_S0	The license granted VPG the limited, exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use certain marks and names incorporating the term "Vishay" in connection with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, provision and performance of certain VPG products that do not compete with any products within Vishay's product range as constituted immediately following the separation and certain services provided in connection with the products.
103730_18_ITEM15_P423_S1	The license cannot be terminated except as a result of willful misconduct or liquidation bankruptcy of VPG.
103730_18_ITEM15_P424_S0	Until the spin-off, VPG was included in Vishay's consolidated federal income tax returns and with Vishay and/or certain of Vishay's subsidiaries in applicable combined or unitary state and local income tax returns.
103730_18_ITEM15_P424_S1	In conjunction with the spin-off, Vishay and VPG entered a tax matters agreement under which Vishay generally will be liable for all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes attributable to VPG with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the distribution date except to the extent that VPG has a liability for such taxes on its books at the time of the spin-off.
