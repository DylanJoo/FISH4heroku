912750_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In August 2010, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) alleging that we failed to provide adequate financial assurance for some of the water injection wells falling under EPA jurisdiction that are located at our Monument Butte field in Duchesne County, Utah (Monument Butte).
912750_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The injection wells are part of an enhanced oil recovery project designed to optimize production from Monument Butte.
912750_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, require operators of injection wells to file proof of financial assurance annually to cover the costs to plug and abandon the injection wells.
912750_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The NOV alleges that our 2010 filing (for 2009) did not meet the financial ratio tests required under SDWA regulations.
912750_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	Upon receipt of the NOV, we promptly complied with the EPA s request to put in place additional alternate financial assurance for the wells.
912750_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	We have held preliminary discussions with the EPA regarding potential settlement of this matter; however, the amount of penalty to be paid has not been ascertained and a schedule for resolving this matter with the EPA has not been established.
912750_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	The NOV was administrative in nature and did not contain any allegations of environmental spills, releases or pollution.
912750_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	In addition to the foregoing matter, we have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (1) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (2) commercial disputes, (3) personal injury claims and (4) property damage claims.
912750_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM4_P0_S0	There were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth quarter of 2010.

912750_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table shows selected consolidated financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements and selected reserve data derived from our supplementary oil and gas disclosures set forth in Item 8 of this report.
912750_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Reserves and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.
912750_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	Effective December 31, 2009, we adopted revised authoritative accounting and disclosure requirements for oil and gas reserves.
912750_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	As a result, 2010 and 2009 disclosures are not on a basis comparable to the prior years.
912750_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	Please see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations New Accounting Requirements, of this report.
912750_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties.
912750_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our domestic areas of operation include the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains, onshore Texas, Appalachia and the Gulf of Mexico.
912750_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Internationally, we are active in Malaysia and China.
912750_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely.
912750_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	the accounting for our oil and gas activities including among other items, the determination of ceiling test writedowns.
912750_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Any extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital.
912750_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Please see the discussion under Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in Item 1A of this report and Liquidity and Capital Resources below.
912750_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production.
912750_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs.
912750_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced.
912750_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Please see Proved Reserves below and Supplementary Financial Information Supplementary Oil and Gas Disclosures Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves in Item 8 of this report for the change in our total net proved reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves.
912750_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Reserves Proved Reserves.
912750_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are:
912750_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	the fair value of stock-based compensation.
912750_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We do not designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges.
912750_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience, significant non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had net derivative assets of $137 million, of which 35% was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black-Scholes) and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	We value these contracts using a model that considers various inputs including (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12-24 months as part of our risk management program.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We use hedging to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Items 1 and 2 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2010, our debt was comprised of:
912750_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because approximately 94% of our obligations were at fixed rates.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flow, to be immaterial.
912750_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, the management of our company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_11_ITEM8_P5_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates the quantities of oil and gas reserves in 2009 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures .
912750_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

912750_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
912750_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our domestic areas of operation include the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains, onshore Texas, Appalachia and the Gulf of Mexico.
912750_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	Internationally, we are active in Malaysia and China.
912750_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Our financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to Newfield, we, us or our are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	As an independent oil and gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil and gas.
912750_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that oil and gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	A substantial or extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital and on the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
912750_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	Our most significant financial estimates are associated with our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and the fair value of our derivative positions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform with the current year presentation.
912750_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	These reclassifications did not impact our net income, stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Substantially all of our oil and gas production is sold to a variety of purchasers under short-term (less than 12 months) contracts at market sensitive prices.
912750_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured.
912750_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	Revenues from the production of oil and gas on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_11_ITEM8_P20_S3	Differences between these sales and our entitled share of production are not significant.
912750_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Other on our consolidated statement of income.
912750_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Investments primarily consist of debt and equity securities, as well as auction rate securities, a majority of which are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value.
912750_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
912750_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_11_ITEM8_P24_S2	We realized interest income and net gains on our investment securities in 2010, 2009, and 2008, of $1 million, $2 million and $4 million, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility.
912750_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.
912750_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	Generally, our oil and gas receivables are collected within 45 to 60 days of production.
912750_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated.
912750_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and gas operations and oil produced in our operations offshore Malaysia and China but not sold.
912750_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our operations offshore Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	The product inventory consisted of approximately 277,000 barrels and 289,000 barrels of crude oil valued at cost of $15 million and $11 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	Cost for purposes of the carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
912750_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	We capitalized $79 million, $72 million and $69 million of internal costs in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	Interest expense related to unproved properties also is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized on a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, a particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2008 and through September 30, 2009, the present value (10% per annum discount rate) of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves was calculated using the end of period quoted market prices for oil and gas.
912750_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	The risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices decrease significantly or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	At December 31, 2010, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of $4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas and $79.42 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the U.S., Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	During the first quarter of 2009, natural gas prices decreased significantly as compared to prices in effect at December 31, 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	At March 31, 2009, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period-end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for natural gas and $49.65 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at March 31, 2009 exceeded the ceiling amount and, as a result, we recorded a charge of $1.3 billion ($854 million, after-tax) during the first quarter of 2009.
912750_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	At December 31, 2008, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period-end market prices of $5.71 per MMBtu for natural gas and $44.61 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion, after-tax) at December 31, 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P37_S2	In addition, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our Malaysian properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $71 million ($68 million, after-tax) at December 31, 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P37_S3	The ceiling with respect to our properties in China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the properties, requiring no writedown at December 31, 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	See Note 3, Oil and Gas Assets, for a detailed discussion regarding our acquisition and sales transactions during 2010, 2009 and 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized an impairment charge for all recorded goodwill in our domestic reporting unit in the amount of $62 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	The impairment charge resulted from the general decline in the economy and in the oil and gas industry and as a result, our market capitalization, as well as the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	If we were to book goodwill in the future, we would assess the carrying amount of goodwill by testing the goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on December 31, or more frequently if an event occurred or circumstances changed that had an adverse effect on the fair value of a reporting unit such that the fair value could be less than the book value of such unit.
912750_11_ITEM8_P40_S3	If the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its book value (including allocated goodwill), then goodwill would be reduced to its implied fair value and the amount of the impairment charged to earnings.
912750_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The fair value of a reporting unit is based on our estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves and from future exploration for and development of unproved reserves.
912750_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred.
912750_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming the normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for our company.
912750_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_11_ITEM8_P42_S3	Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of income.
912750_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	The change in our ARO for the three years ended December 31, 2010 is set forth below (in millions):
912750_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	We recorded a $14 million asset retirement obligation as a result of our acquisition of assets in the Maverick Basin.
912750_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	See Note 3, Oil and Gas Assets Maverick Basin Asset Acquisition.
912750_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions and as such we had not accrued related interest or penalties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	The tax years 2007-2010 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced a limited scope audit of our U.S. income tax return for the 2005 tax year.
912750_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	In 2010, the IRS issued a No Change letter for the 2005 tax year and closed the audit.
912750_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	We use a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
912750_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	See Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Our joint interest partners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers.
912750_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	If the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general was adversely affected, the ability of our joint interest partners to reimburse us could be adversely affected.
912750_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	The purchasers of our oil and gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Historically, we have sold our oil and gas production to several purchasers.
912750_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	The use of hedging transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	The counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	We monitor on an ongoing basis the credit ratings of our hedging counterparties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P54_S3	Although we have entered into hedging contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P54_S4	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P54_S5	At December 31, 2010, Barclays Capital, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley, Bank of Montreal, J Aron Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to 85% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production.
912750_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales of oil and gas production during 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	During 2009 and 2008, sales of our oil and gas production to Big West Oil LLC accounted for 16% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues (before the effects of hedging).
912750_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	An extended loss of Big West Oil LLC, or any of our other large purchasers of our Monument Butte field oil production, could have a material adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of the black wax crude oil, which we produce from this field.
912750_11_ITEM8_P55_S3	Due to the higher paraffin content of this production, it must remain heated during shipping so it cannot be transported in conventional pipelines, and there is limited refining capacity for it in the vicinity of our production.
912750_11_ITEM8_P55_S4	In poor economic environments and tight financial markets, there is an increased risk that the current purchasers of our production may fail to satisfy their obligations to us under our crude oil purchase contracts.
912750_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, Big West Oil LLC failed to pay for certain deliveries of crude oil and filed for bankruptcy protection.
912750_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	Although we continue to sell our black wax crude oil to Big West Oil LLC on a short-term basis that provides for more timely cash payments, during 2010 we commenced delivering crude oil to other purchasers in the vicinity in order to reduce our financial exposure to that purchaser.
912750_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	Despite the additional purchasers, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to sell to these purchasers or that similar substitute arrangements could be made for sales of our black wax crude oil with other purchasers if desired.
912750_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	We account for our derivative activities by applying authoritative accounting and reporting guidance which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
912750_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	All of the derivative instruments that we utilize are to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production.
912750_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	We have elected not to designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance, and, accordingly, account for them using the mark-to-market accounting method.
912750_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	values are reported currently in earnings.
912750_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	We have also utilized derivatives to manage our exposure to variable interest rates.
912750_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	See Note 4 Derivative Financial Instruments, for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as well as unrealized gains and losses on investments and changes in post-retirement benefits, all recorded net of tax.
912750_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	As of December 31, 2010, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of $11 million related to an unrealized loss on investments and $1 million related to an unrealized loss on post-retirement benefits.
912750_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	As of December 31, 2009, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of $11 million related to an unrealized loss on investments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities that was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	We adopted the disclosure requirements beginning January 1, 2009.
912750_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	Please see Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	The adoption did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which makes fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles, enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures, and provides greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	The additional guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
912750_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	We adopted the provisions for the period ended March 31, 2009.
912750_11_ITEM8_P63_S3	The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
912750_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	Although there is new terminology, the guidance is based on the same principles as those that previously existed.
912750_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	This guidance was effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
912750_11_ITEM8_P64_S3	Our adoption of these provisions beginning with the period ended June 30, 2009 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule).
912750_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Final Rule adopts revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on Form 10-K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009.
912750_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	The revisions were intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies.
912750_11_ITEM8_P65_S3	The amendments were also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology.
912750_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010-03), which aligned the FASB s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate.
912750_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule were not required.
912750_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	Our adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates.
912750_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices.
912750_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Our full-cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2010 and 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules.
912750_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	We historically have applied a policy of using our year-end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate.
912750_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or the prior year.
912750_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	On April 20, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-14, Accounting for Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (ASU 2010-14), which aligned the oil and gas financial accounting and reporting requirements prescribed by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-14 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons for the transfers and disclosure of major purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy.
912750_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which we will adopt for the quarter ending March 31, 2011.
912750_11_ITEM8_P74_S4	Adopting the disclosure requirements did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P74_S5	We do not expect adoption of the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures in 2011 to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (other than unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	Diluted earnings per share incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_11_ITEM8_P75_S3	Please see Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation.
912750_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010:
912750_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	The calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2010 does not include the effect of 0.7 million unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units because to do so would be anti-dilutive.
912750_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	The effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding has not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	Had we recognized net income for these periods, incremental shares attributable to the assumed exercise of outstanding options and the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units would have increased diluted weighted-average shares outstanding by two million shares and three million shares for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	Property and equipment consisted of the following at:
912750_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	Oil and gas properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which we own an interest.
912750_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	These unproved property costs include unevaluated leasehold acreage, geological and geophysical data costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, costs associated with wells currently drilling and capitalized interest.
912750_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	We exclude these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired.
912750_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	Unproved property costs are grouped by major prospect area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant.
912750_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	Costs associated with wells in progress are transferred to the amortization base upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results.
912750_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	All other costs excluded from the amortization base are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred.
912750_11_ITEM8_P81_S3	The amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for international operations if a reserve base has not yet been established.
912750_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following is a summary of our oil and gas properties not subject to amortization as of December 31, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	We believe that our evaluation activities related to substantially all of our conventional properties not subject to amortization will be completed within four years.
912750_11_ITEM8_P82_S2	Because of the size of our unconventional resource plays, their entire evaluation will take significantly longer than four years.
912750_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	At December 31, 2010, approximately 65% of oil and gas properties not subject to amortization were associated with our unconventional resource plays.
912750_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	On February 11, 2010, we acquired certain of TXCO Resources Inc. s assets in the Maverick Basin of southwest Texas for approximately $205 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	In the acquisition, we obtained an interest in approximately 300,000 net acres, primarily in the Pearsall and Eagle Ford shale plays, as well as production of 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
912750_11_ITEM8_P84_S2	Our consolidated financial statements include the cash flows and results of operations for these assets subsequent to the acquisition date.
912750_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $108 million, $9 million and $223 million, respectively, and sold various other oil and gas properties for approximately $12 million, $33 million and $9 million, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	We utilize swap, floor, collar and three-way collar derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production.
912750_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	With respect to a swap contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price.
912750_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	For a floor contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price.
912750_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	We are not required to make any payment in connection with the settlement of a floor contract.
912750_11_ITEM8_P88_S3	For a collar contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price, we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price and neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price.
912750_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	A three-way collar contract consists of a standard collar contract plus a put sold by us with a price below the floor price of the collar.
912750_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	This additional put requires us to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the put price.
912750_11_ITEM8_P89_S2	Combining the collar contract with the additional put results in us being entitled to a net payment equal to the difference between the floor price of the standard collar and the additional put price if the settlement price is equal to or less than the additional put price.
912750_11_ITEM8_P89_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar contract only.
912750_11_ITEM8_P89_S4	This strategy enables us to increase the floor and the ceiling price of the collar beyond the range of a traditional no cost collar while defraying the associated cost with the sale of the additional put.
912750_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	All of our derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	Substantially all of our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, volatility and, in the case of collars and floors, the time value of options.
912750_11_ITEM8_P90_S3	The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_11_ITEM8_P90_S4	Please see Note 7, Fair Value Measurements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	We recognize all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts on a mark-to-market basis in our consolidated statement of income under the caption Commodity derivative income.
912750_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	Settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating cash flows on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
912750_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	During the first six months of 2008, we entered into a series of transactions that had the effect of resetting all of our then outstanding crude oil hedges for 2009 and 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	At the time of the reset, the mark-to-market value of these hedge contracts was a liability of $502 million and we paid an additional $56 million to purchase option contracts.
912750_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding contracts with respect to our future production that are not designated for hedge accounting as set forth in the tables below.
912750_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had natural gas basis contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting to lock in the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points in the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent, as set forth in the table below.
912750_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	We previously hedged $50 million principal amount of our $175 million 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 through an interest rate swap.
912750_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	The swap provided for us to pay variable and receive fixed payments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P95_S2	During the first half of 2010, we repurchased our outstanding 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 and received approximately $2 million upon the termination and settlement of the swap.
912750_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
912750_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	Derivatives designated as a fair value hedge:
912750_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income related to our derivative financial instruments was as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
912750_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	Derivative designated as a fair value hedge:
912750_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	The total realized gain on commodity derivatives differs from the cash receipts on derivative settlements due to the recognition of option premiums associated with derivatives settled during the period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative instruments with that counterparty.
912750_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	At December 31, 2010, Barclays Capital, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley, Bank of Montreal, J Aron Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to 85% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production.
912750_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	A significant number of the counterparties to our derivative instruments also are lenders under our credit facility.
912750_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	Our credit facility, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	As of the indicated dates, our accounts receivable consisted of the following:
912750_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	During the third quarter of 2010, an oil export pipeline from our East Belumut platform was damaged by the activities of another company s marine vessel unrelated to our operations in Malaysia.
912750_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	All expenses associated with the repair and clean up operations are covered by insurance.
912750_11_ITEM8_P106_S2	We recorded a receivable of $9 million related to our insurance coverage for these costs, which is included in Accounts Receivable Other.
912750_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	As of the indicated dates, our accrued liabilities consisted of the following:
912750_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	can be derived from observable data or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_11_ITEM8_P113_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps, certain investments and interest rate swaps.
912750_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_11_ITEM8_P115_S1	Our valuation methodology for investments is a discounted cash flow model that considers various inputs including: (a) the coupon rate specified under the debt instruments, (b) the current credit ratings of the underlying issuers, (c) collateral characteristics and (d) risk adjusted discount rates.
912750_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as basis swaps, commodity options including, price collars, floors and three-way collars (as of December 31, 2010, our options were comprised of only three-way collars) and some financial investments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	Although we utilize third party broker quotes to assess the reasonableness of our prices and valuation techniques, we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2.
912750_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_11_ITEM8_P117_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
912750_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	The following tables summarize the valuation of our investments and financial instrument assets (liabilities) by pricing levels:
912750_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	The determination of the fair values above incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities, but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we continued to hold $30 million of auction rate securities maturing beginning in 2033 that are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	This amount reflects a decrease in the fair value of these investments of $17 million ($11 million net of tax), recorded under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_11_ITEM8_P121_S2	As of December 31, 2009, we held $40 million of auction rate securities, which reflected a decrease in the fair value of $15 million ($10 million net of tax).
912750_11_ITEM8_P121_S3	The debt instruments underlying these investments are mostly investment grade (rated BBB+ or better) and are guaranteed by the United States government or backed by private loan collateral.
912750_11_ITEM8_P121_S4	We do not believe the decrease in the fair value of these securities is permanent because we currently intend to hold these investments until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.
912750_11_ITEM8_P121_S5	Our current available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements provides us the liquidity to continue to hold these securities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	The following tables set forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for December 31, 2010:
912750_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted market prices as of the indicated dates, was as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	Amounts outstanding under our credit arrangements at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	As of the indicated dates, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	Because capacity under our credit facility was available to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations, if any, are classified as long-term.
912750_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	We previously hedged $50 million principal amount of our $175 million 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 through an interest rate swap.
912750_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	The swap provided for us to pay variable and receive fixed payments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P127_S2	During the first half of 2010, we repurchased our outstanding 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 and received approximately $2 million upon the termination and settlement of the swap.
912750_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	We have a revolving credit facility which provides for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of more than 15 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent, and matures June 2012.
912750_11_ITEM8_P128_S1	In the future, total loan commitments under the facility could be increased to a maximum of $1.65 billion if the existing lenders increase their individual loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the facility.
912750_11_ITEM8_P128_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 16% of total commitments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points or (b) a base Eurodollar rate substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (87.5 basis points per annum at December 31, 2010).
912750_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	We pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating (0.175% per annum at December 31, 2010).
912750_11_ITEM8_P130_S1	We incurred fees under this arrangement of approximately $2 million, $1 million and $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which are recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income.
912750_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0; maintenance of a ratio of total debt to earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns, and goodwill impairments) of at least 3.5 to 1.0.
912750_11_ITEM8_P131_S1	At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	Letters of credit are subject to an issuance fee of 12.5 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating (87.5 basis points at December 31, 2010).
912750_11_ITEM8_P132_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, as of December 31, 2010, we also have a total of $105 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	Our credit facility and senior subordinated notes contain standard events of default and, if any such events of default were to occur, our lenders could terminate future lending commitments under the credit facility and our lenders could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_11_ITEM8_P134_S1	In addition, our credit facility, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011.
912750_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	During the first half of 2010, we accepted for purchase and payment our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011.
912750_11_ITEM8_P136_S1	The tender offer and repurchase included the payment of an early redemption premium of $12 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P136_S2	This premium was recorded under the caption Operating expenses Other on our consolidated statement of income.
912750_11_ITEM8_P136_S3	We primarily funded the tender offer with a portion of the proceeds from our January 25, 2010 Senior Subordinated Notes issuance.
912750_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	In August 2004, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 5 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014.
912750_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	The net proceeds from the offering were $323 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	In April 2006, we issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 5 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016.
912750_11_ITEM8_P138_S1	The net proceeds from the offering were $545 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	In May 2008, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 1 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018.
912750_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	We received net proceeds from the offering of $592 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	In January 2010, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 and received net proceeds of $686 million (net of discount and offering costs).
912750_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	These notes were issued at 99.109% of par to yield 7%.
912750_11_ITEM8_P140_S2	We used $294 million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, $215 million to fund the acquisition of assets from TXCO Resources Inc. and funded a portion of the tender offer of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_11_ITEM8_P141_S1	The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness.
912750_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	We may redeem some or all of our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2014 at any time on or after September 1, 2009 and some or all of our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2016 at any time on or after April 15, 2011, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P142_S1	We also may redeem all but not part of our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2016 prior to April 15, 2011, at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	We may redeem some or all of our 7 1 / 8 % notes due 2018 at any time on or after May 15, 2013 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P143_S1	Prior to May 15, 2013, we may redeem all, but not part, of these notes at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_11_ITEM8_P143_S2	In addition, before May 15, 2011, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of these notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 107.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	We may redeem some or all of our 6 7 / 8 % notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P144_S1	Prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem some or all of these notes at a make-whole redemption price.
912750_11_ITEM8_P144_S2	In addition, before February 1, 2013, we may redeem up to 35% of these notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 106.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things:
912750_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets.
912750_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	For the indicated periods, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	For the indicated periods, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 was different than the amount computed using the federal statutory rate (35%) for the following reasons:
912750_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	As of the indicated dates, the components of our deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability were as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_11_ITEM8_P151_S1	NOL carryforwards of $273 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_11_ITEM8_P151_S2	To the extent not utilized, the NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2030.
912750_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	Utilization of NOL carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had NOL carryforwards for international income tax purposes of approximately $29 million.
912750_11_ITEM8_P153_S1	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $17 million of our international NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P153_S2	Therefore, valuation allowances were established for these items in 2005 and 2006.
912750_11_ITEM8_P153_S3	The remaining $12 million will expire in 2013.
912750_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices, estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	The rollforward of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	In 2009, we reversed the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset associated with our fourth quarter 2008 ceiling test writedown in Malaysia.
912750_11_ITEM8_P156_S1	The valuation allowance was released as a result of a substantial increase in our estimate of future taxable income in Malaysia due to increases in anticipated future crude oil prices.
912750_11_ITEM8_P157_S0	U.S. deferred taxes have not been recorded with respect to foreign income of $39 million that is permanently reinvested internationally.
912750_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	We currently do not have any foreign tax credits available to reduce U.S. taxes on this income if it was repatriated.
912750_11_ITEM8_P158_S0	We make stock-based compensation awards to employees through the Newfield Exploration Company 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan (the 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan) and to non-employee directors through the Newfield Exploration Company 2009 Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P158_S1	The fair value of grants under these plans are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	Historically, we have issued new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_11_ITEM8_P159_S1	Beginning in 2009, we began to utilize treasury shares when stock options are exercised, restricted stock is issued or restricted stock units vest.
912750_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	Shares available for grant under our 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan are reduced by 1.5 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan, and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had approximately (1) 1.4 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing employee and director plans if all future employee awards under our 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan are stock options, or (2) one million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing employee and director plans if all future employee awards under our 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_11_ITEM8_P160_S2	Thus far, the majority of the awards under our 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan have been granted as restricted stock unit awards.
912750_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	As of the indicated dates, our stock-based compensation consisted of the following:
912750_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	The excess tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital and is calculated as the amount by which the tax deduction we receive exceeds the deferred tax asset associated with recorded stock-based compensation expense.
912750_11_ITEM8_P162_S1	We did not realize an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation for 2010, 2009 or 2008 because we did not have sufficient taxable income to fully realize the deduction.
912750_11_ITEM8_P162_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had unrecognized net operating losses of $83 million related to stock-based compensation.
912750_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $55 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards.
912750_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	This compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P163_S2	The full amount is expected to be recognized within approximately five years.
912750_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	We have granted stock options under several plans.
912750_11_ITEM8_P164_S1	Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_11_ITEM8_P164_S2	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
912750_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following table provides information about stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
912750_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of our common stock at the indicated date, or at the time of exercise, exceeds the exercise price of the option.
912750_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	The fair value of the options granted during 2008 was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, assuming no dividends, a risk-free weighted-average interest rate of 2.83%, an expected life of 5.2 years and weighted-average volatility of 31.7%.
912750_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	On December 31, 2010, the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $72.11 per share.

912750_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	At December 31, 2010, our employees held an aggregate of 2.2 million shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that primarily vest over a service period of three to five years.
912750_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	The vesting of these shares and units is dependent upon the employee s continued service with our company.
912750_11_ITEM8_P170_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2010, our employees held 0.3 million shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting criteria (substantially all of which are considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	Under our non-employee director restricted stock plan as in effect on December 31, 2010, immediately after each annual meeting of our stockholders, each of our non-employee directors then in office receive a number of shares of restricted stock determined by dividing a specified market value by the closing sales price of our common stock on the date of the annual meeting.
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S1	In addition, each non-employee director who is appointed by our Board (not in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders) is granted restricted stock with the same market value as used for the previous annual meeting, with the number of shares of restricted stock determined by dividing the market value by the closing sales price of our common stock on the date of appointment.
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S2	With respect to grants made on the date of our 2009 annual meeting of stockholders, the market value of the award to non-employee directors was $100,000.
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S3	With respect to each annual meeting after our 2009 annual meeting, the Nominating Corporate Governance Committee of our Board determines the market value of the award by resolution in advance of the meeting.
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S4	In 2010, the market value of the award was $150,000.
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S5	If the Chairman of the Board is a non-employee director, the award amount may be greater than the award amount for the other non-employee directors.
912750_11_ITEM8_P171_S6	If a non-employee director Chairman of the Board is appointed not in connection with an annual meeting, the award amount will be determined by the Nominating Corporate Governance Committee on the date of appointment.
912750_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	Restrictions on restricted stock granted pursuant to the plan generally lapse on the day before the first annual meeting of stockholders after the date of grant.
912750_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	An aggregate of 200,000 shares of restricted stock were initially available for issuance pursuant to our non-employee director restricted stock plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	As of December 31, 2010, there were 137,277 shares of restricted stock available for grant and 29,360 shares of restricted stock outstanding under our non-employee director restricted stock plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	The following table provides information about restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
912750_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $39 million, $15 million and $3 million, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	Pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, for each six month period beginning on January 1 or July 1 during the term of the plan, each eligible employee has the opportunity to purchase our common stock for a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the period or the last day of the period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P176_S1	No employee may purchase common stock under the plan valued at more than $25,000 in any calendar year.
912750_11_ITEM8_P176_S2	Employees of our foreign subsidiaries are not eligible to participate in the plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	At our May 7, 2010 annual meeting, our stockholders approved the Newfield Exploration Company 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	This plan replaced our 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was terminated on June 30, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P177_S2	This plan became effective July 1, 2010 with one million shares of our common stock available for issuance.
912750_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	During 2010, options to purchase 83,009 shares of our common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plans.
912750_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	The weighted-average fair value of each option was $13.23 per share.
912750_11_ITEM8_P178_S2	The fair value of the options granted was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends, a risk-free weighted-average interest rate of 0.21%, an expected life of six months and weighted-average volatility of 45%.
912750_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	At December 31, 2010, 954,737 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the current plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	During 2009, options to purchase 139,207 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average fair value of $8.95 per share were issued under the plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends, a risk-free weighted-average interest rate of 0.29%, an expected life of six months and weighted-average volatility of 80.49%.

912750_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	As a result of our acquisition of EEX Corporation in November 2002, we assumed responsibility for a defined benefit pension plan for current and former employees of EEX and its subsidiaries.
912750_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	The plan was amended, effective March 31, 2003, to cease all future retirement benefit accruals.
912750_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	We filed for a standard termination with a proposed plan termination date of April 30, 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P183_S3	A favorable determination letter was received on March 16, 2009 from the Internal Revenue Service.
912750_11_ITEM8_P183_S4	During the second half of 2009, we completed the formal termination process and all participants received full payment of their obligation through an annuity purchase or a lump sum payment.
912750_11_ITEM8_P183_S5	Curtailment accounting was applied for year-end 2009 resulting in a charge of $3 million recorded to general and administrative expense associated with changes in the pension liability due to actual plan termination costs.
912750_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	We sponsor a post-retirement medical plan that covers all retired employees until they reach age 65.
912750_11_ITEM8_P184_S1	At December 31, 2010, both our accumulated benefit obligation and our accrued benefit costs were $8 million.

912750_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	The expected future benefit payments under our post-retirement medical plan for the next ten years are as follows (in millions):
912750_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	During 2010, our Board of Directors, with the recommendation of the Compensation Management Development Committee approved a new annual cash incentive compensation plan for all employees (the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan).
912750_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	Under the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Management Development Committee determines the annual award pool for all employees based upon a number of factors including the Company s performance against stated performance goals and in comparison with peer companies in our industry.
912750_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	All employees are eligible if employed on October 1 and December 31 of the performance period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P187_S2	Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2010, our annual cash incentive compensation will be paid in a single payment to employees during the first quarter after the end of the performance period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	Incentive compensation awards for periods prior to 2010 were made under our 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	That plan provided for the creation of an award pool that was equal to 5% of our adjusted net income (as defined in the plan) and it was administered by the Compensation Management Development Committee.
912750_11_ITEM8_P188_S2	Awards under the plan could have both a current and a long-term component with the long-term cash awards being paid in four annual installments consisting of 25% of the long-term award, plus interest.
912750_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	Total incentive compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $36 million, $28 million and $35 million, respectively.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	We sponsor a 401(k) profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S1	This plan covers all of our employees other than employees of our foreign subsidiaries.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S2	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the IRS.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S3	We also sponsor a highly compensated employee deferred compensation plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S4	This non-qualified plan allows an eligible employee to defer a portion of his or her salary or bonus on an annual basis.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S5	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the plan.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S6	Our contribution with respect to each participant in the deferred compensation plan is reduced by the amount of contribution made by us to our 401(k) plan for that participant.
912750_11_ITEM8_P190_S7	Our combined contributions to these two plans totaled $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	We have various commitments under non-cancellable operating lease agreements for office space and firm transportation.

912750_11_ITEM8_P193_S1	We have work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other related commitments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P193_S2	At December 31, 2010, these work-related commitments totaled $65 million, all of which were attributable to our international business.
912750_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	We also have various commitments for drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	The majority of these commitments are related to contracts for hydraulic well fracturing services and drilling rigs and payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties.
912750_11_ITEM8_P194_S2	As of December 31, 2010, future payments under these agreements are approximately $88 million in 2011, $71 million in 2012, and $14 million in 2013.
912750_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are primarily related to operations in our Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain divisions.

912750_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (1) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (2) commercial disputes, (3) personal injury claims and (4) property damage claims.
912750_11_ITEM8_P196_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are organizationally structured along geographic operating segments.
912750_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	Our current operating segments are the United States, Malaysia, China and Other International.
912750_11_ITEM8_P197_S2	The accounting policies of each of our operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
912750_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
912750_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	Income tax allocations have been determined based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment.
912750_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	Susan G. Riggs, our Treasurer, is a minority owner of Huffco International L.L.C. (Huffco).
912750_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	In May 1997, before Ms. Riggs joined us, we acquired from Huffco an entity now known as Newfield China, LDC, the owner of a 12% interest in a three field unit located on Blocks 04/36 and 05/36 in Bohai Bay, offshore China.
912750_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	incurred with respect to exploration and production in Block 05/36, plus the cash purchase price we paid Huffco for Newfield China ($6 million).
912750_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	During 2010 and 2009, Newfield China paid $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of dividends to Huffco on the preferred shares of Newfield China.
912750_11_ITEM8_P201_S2	Based on our estimate of the net present value of the proved reserves associated with Block 05/36, the indirect interest (through Huffco) in Newfield China s preferred shares held by Ms. Riggs had a net present value of approximately $175,000 at December 31, 2010.
912750_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	The results of operations by quarter for the indicated periods are as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	Effective December 31, 2009, we adopted revised authoritative accounting and disclosure requirements for oil and gas reserves.
912750_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	As a result, amounts for the fourth quarter of 2009 and all quarters during 2010 are not on a basis comparable to prior periods.
912750_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	The sum of the individual quarterly earnings (loss) per share may not agree with year-to-date earnings (loss) per share as each quarterly computation is based on the income or loss for that quarter and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter.
912750_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	Income (loss) from operations for the first quarter of 2009 includes a full cost ceiling test writedown of $1.3 billion.
912750_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	Costs incurred for oil and gas property acquisitions, exploration and development for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 are as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	Other items impacting the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties which are not included in total costs incurred are as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	Capitalized costs for our oil and gas producing activities consisted of the following at the end of each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010:
912750_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_11_ITEM8_P209_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_11_ITEM8_P209_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	Recent SEC and FASB Rule-Making Activities.
912750_11_ITEM8_P210_S1	On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the Final Rule adopting revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements.
912750_11_ITEM8_P210_S2	In addition, in January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-03, which aligned the FASB s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_11_ITEM8_P210_S3	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies New Accounting Requirements .
912750_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate.
912750_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	Such a change was accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance.
912750_11_ITEM8_P211_S2	Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule were not required.
912750_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	Our adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, as follows:
912750_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period.
912750_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates.
912750_11_ITEM8_P213_S2	Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices.
912750_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	Our full-cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2010 and 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules.
912750_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	We historically have applied a policy of using our year-end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate.
912750_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or the prior year.
912750_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.
912750_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	The technical employee responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, with more than 25 years of experience (including 15 years of experience in reserve estimation) and is a Registered Professional Engineer in Texas.
912750_11_ITEM8_P216_S3	For additional information regarding our reserves estimation process please see Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Reserves.
912750_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	The following table sets forth our total net proved reserves and our total net proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and the changes in our total net proved reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010:
912750_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	All of our reserves in Malaysia and China are associated with production sharing contracts and are calculated using the economic interest method.
912750_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	Total revisions in 2009 included 259 Bcfe of reserves that were no longer economic utilizing a natural gas price of $3.87 per MMBtu for our year-end 2009 reserve calculations.

912750_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Effective December 31, 2009, we adopted revised authoritative accounting and disclosure requirements for oil and gas reserves.
912750_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	As a result, 2011, 2010 and 2009 disclosures are not on a basis comparable to the prior years.
912750_12_ITEM6_P1_S2	Please see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations New Accounting Requirements, of this report.
912750_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
912750_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our principal domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore Texas.
912750_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Internationally, we focus on offshore oil developments in Malaysia and China.
912750_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely.
912750_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce.
912750_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced.
912750_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	Significant 2011 operational highlights include the following:
912750_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Production commenced in late 2011 from two new offshore developments in Malaysia East Piatu and Puteri, which are now providing combined net production of approximately 11,000 BOEPD as of February 15, 2012.
912750_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Significant 2011 financial highlights include the following:
912750_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	During 2011, we monetized approximately $406 million in sales of non-strategic assets and executed contracts to monetize an additional $335 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production and do not include the effects of the settlements of our hedges.
912750_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Please see Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from period-to-period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold.
912750_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, substantially all of the crude oil from our operations offshore Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into the FPSO.
912750_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	As a result, the timing of liftings may impact period-to-period results.
912750_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Revenues of $2.5 billion for 2011 were 31% higher than 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Approximately half of the increase in revenue for 2011 was due to higher average realized oil prices and half of the increase resulted from increased oil production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Revenues of $1.9 billion for 2010 were 41% higher than 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	For 2010, approximately 60% of the revenue increase was due to higher average realized oil and gas prices, 25% related to increased oil production and the remainder resulted from increased natural gas production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	(2) Historically, we reported natural gas liquids (NGLs) volumes in natural gas production volumes.
912750_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Effective January 1, 2011, we began reporting our NGLs in barrels and included NGLs with total oil and condensate production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	As such, all production volumes and average realized prices for periods prior to 2011 have been reclassified for comparability between periods.
912750_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our 2011 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 2% over 2010 production primarily due to increased production of 8% in our Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent divisions as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts, partially offset by production decreases in our onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico deepwater divisions due to natural field decline and weather- and equipment-related delays.
912750_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our 2010 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 14% over 2009 production primarily due to increased production of 18 Bcfe in our Mid-Continent division as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts, combined with increased production of 13 Bcfe as a result of the further development of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater discoveries.
912750_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our 2011 international oil production increased over 2010 levels primarily due to an increase in production of 13% in Malaysia as a result of new field developments on PM 323 and PM 329 and the timing of liftings.
912750_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	Our 2010 international oil production decreased slightly from 2009 levels primarily due to the timing of liftings from our oil production in Malaysia.
912750_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period-to-period is on a unit-of-production, or per Mcfe, basis.
912750_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two-year period ended December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our domestic operating expenses for 2011, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 21% over those for 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Lease operating expense (LOE) includes normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our oil and gas wells, non-recurring well workover and repair-related expenses and the costs to transport our production to the applicable sales points.
912750_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in domestic LOE per Mcfe resulted from a 50% ($0.26 per Mcfe) increase in the normally recurring portion of our LOE.
912750_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Recurring LOE in our Rocky Mountain division accounted for approximately 60% of the increase due to increased water handling and overall operating and service-related costs in the basins in which we operate.
912750_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	In addition, LOE increased ($0.08 per Mcfe) due to increased transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts in our Mid-Continent division throughout 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased due to a 21% increase in realized oil prices during 2011, coupled with a 4% increase in oil and natural gas production subject to production taxes.
912750_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Since late 2009, the shift of our capital investments toward the oil plays in our portfolio has resulted in an increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) rate.
912750_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in total DD A expense is related to the increase in the DD A rate, coupled with the slight increase in our production volumes during 2011 compared to 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	General and administrative (G A) expense per Mcfe increased during 2011 due to employee-related expenses associated with our growing domestic work force and approximately $7 million of legal expenses related to litigation in which we are the plaintiff.
912750_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	During 2011, we capitalized $83 million ($0.33 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $61 million ($0.25 per Mcfe) during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of $7 million ($0.03 per Mcfe) for certain claims related to the bankruptcy proceedings associated with TXCO Resources Inc.
912750_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Other expenses for 2010 included the early redemption premium of $12 million associated with the tender offer and repurchase of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011, partially offset by the $2 million cash received resulting from the termination of the associated interest rate swap.
912750_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Our international operating expenses for 2011, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 63% over 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	LOE per Mcfe increased due to non-recurring pipeline and facilities repair in Malaysia, fixed production costs associated with certain of our production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Malaysia and increased overall operating service costs from the various PSCs during 2011 compared to 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased significantly due to an increase, per the terms of the PSCs, in the tax rate per barrel of oil lifted and sold as a result of the 44% increase in realized oil prices in 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two-year period ended December 31, 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Our domestic operating expenses for 2010, stated on a Mcfe basis, decreased 60% as compared to 2009 primarily due to the full cost ceiling test writedown recorded at March 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	LOE per Mcfe increased 14% primarily due to increased product transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts during late 2009 and throughout 2010 in our Mid-Continent division.
912750_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased 20% primarily due to higher realized commodity prices during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Total G A expense increased 8% primarily due to increased employee-related expenses associated with our growing domestic workforce.
912750_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Employee-related expenses include incentive compensation expense which is based on our company performance in comparison with peer companies in our industry as defined in the incentive compensation plan in effect during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	During 2010, we capitalized $61 million ($0.25 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $58 million ($0.27 per Mcfe) in 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of $7 million ($0.03 per Mcfe) related to certain claims related to the bankruptcy proceedings associated with TXCO Resources Inc.
912750_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	In 2009, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.3 billion ($6.20 per Mcfe) due to significantly lower natural gas prices at March 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Other expenses for 2010 includes the early redemption premium of $12 million associated with the tender offer and repurchase of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011, partially offset by the $2 million cash received resulting from the termination of the associated interest rate swap.
912750_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Other expenses for 2009 includes long-term rig contract termination fees.
912750_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our international operating expenses for 2010, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 31% over the same period of 2009 primarily as a result of significantly higher production taxes during 2010 due to substantially higher realized oil prices.
912750_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	LOE per Mcfe increased 12% primarily due to fixed production and operating costs associated with certain of our PSCs in Malaysia, a change in the mix of produced, lifted and sold production from various PSCs during 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 and increased workover activity.
912750_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased significantly due to an increase, per the terms of the PSCs, in the tax rate per barrel of oil lifted and sold as a result of a 26% increase in realized oil prices during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011:
912750_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The increase in gross interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily resulted from increased borrowings under our credit arrangements and the September 2011 issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022.
912750_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in gross interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily resulted from the January 2010 issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, partially offset by the tender and repurchase of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 during the first half of 2010 and lower outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	See Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Interest expense related to unproved properties is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Capitalized interest increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to an increase in the average balance of unproved properties primarily resulting from the acquisition of assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah.
912750_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Capitalized interest increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the average balance of unproved properties primarily as a result of the Maverick Basin asset acquisition in February 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The significant fluctuations in commodity derivative income from period-to-period are due to the significant volatility of oil and gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these periods.
912750_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 36%, 37% and 39%, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory tax rate due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits, state income taxes and the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates.
912750_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Our effective tax rate generally approximates 37%.
912750_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	Our effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to the Malaysia tax benefit recorded in 2008.
912750_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices, the timing, amount, and location of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs.
912750_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and property acquisitions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	These activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	Lower prices for oil and gas may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce, and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as further described below.
912750_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, primarily cash flows from operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Approximately 80% of our expected 2012 domestic oil and gas production (excluding NGLs) supporting the current 2012 capital budget is hedged.
912750_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Our 2012 capital budget, excluding capitalized interest and overhead of $210 million, is approximately $1.5 to $1.7 billion and focuses on projects with higher return on investment and which we believe generate and lay the foundation for oil production growth in 2012 and thereafter.
912750_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Substantially all of the 2012 budget is allocated to oil or liquids-rich projects.
912750_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired.
912750_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling.
912750_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.
912750_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	We have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The acquisitions were funded with borrowings under our credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	During 2011, we received proceeds from the sale of certain non-strategic assets of approximately $406 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	We used the proceeds from these sales to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	In September 2011, we sold $750 million of 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022 and received proceeds of $742 million (net of discount and offering costs).
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	These notes were issued at 99.956% of par to yield 5 3 / 4 %.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S6	We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S7	We continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of $32 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S8	We attempt to sell these securities every 7-28 days until the auctions succeed, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S9	We currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent or that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P37_S10	See Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the auction rate securities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	In June 2011, we entered into a new revolving credit facility that matures in June 2016 and provides for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of 13 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the largest individual commitment by any lender was 13% of total commitments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we also have a total of $185 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements, please see Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	At February 21, 2012, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S5	In addition, we had no outstanding borrowings under either our credit facility or our money market lines of credit.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S6	Our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately $1.4 billion as of February 21, 2012.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S7	Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S8	Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S9	Although we anticipate that our 2012 capital spending (excluding acquisitions) will correspond with our anticipated 2012 cash flows from operations and property sales proceeds, we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from operations do not necessarily match.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S10	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had negative working capital of $157 million and $197 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S11	The changes in our working capital are primarily a result of the timing of the collection of receivables, drilling activities, payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S12	Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S13	We sell substantially all of our oil and gas production under floating price market sensitive contracts.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S14	We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12-24 months.
912750_12_ITEM7_P38_S15	See Oil and Gas Hedging below.
912750_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	We typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within 45-60 days of production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by DD A, ceiling test writedowns, other impairments or other non-cash charges or credits.
912750_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	Our net cash flows from operations were approximately $1.6 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our working capital requirements change each year as a result of the timing of drilling activities, receivable collections from purchasers and joint interest partners, payments made by us to vendors and other operators, the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations and the change in net cash receipts on derivative settlements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 was $2.2 billion compared to $2.0 billion for 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our capital investments of $2.2 billion for 2011 increased 34% from our capital investments of $1.7 billion during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	These amounts exclude acquisitions of $321 million and $314 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and recorded asset retirement obligations of $33 million and $13 million in the respective years.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Of the total $2.6 billion spent during 2011, we invested $1.5 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $237 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $433 million in acquisitions of proved and unproved property (leasehold) and domestic leasing activity and $333 million outside the United States.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	Our capital investments of $1.7 billion for 2010 increased 18% from our capital investments of $1.4 billion during 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	These amounts exclude acquisitions of $314 million and $2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and recorded asset retirement obligations of $13 million and $19 million in the respective years.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S5	Of the total $2.0 billion spent during 2010, we invested $1.2 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $248 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $400 million in acquisitions of proved and unproved property (leasehold) and domestic leasing activity and $173 million outside the United States.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S6	We have budgeted $1.5 to $1.7 billion for capital spending in 2012.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S7	The planned budget excludes capitalized interest and overhead of $210 million and acquisitions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S8	Substantially all of the 2012 budget is allocated to oil or liquids-rich projects.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S9	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S10	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling.
912750_12_ITEM7_P40_S11	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.
912750_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The assets include approximately 65,000 net acres, which are largely undeveloped and located in the Central Basin, which is just north of our Greater Monument Butte field.
912750_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Net cash flows provided by financing activities for 2011 were $684 million compared to $282 million for 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	repurchased $19 million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards.
912750_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	repurchased $17 million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards.
912750_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations by maturity as of December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	(1) Interest associated with our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit was calculated using a weighted-average interest rate of 1.99% at December 31, 2011 and is included through the maturity of the facility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	(2) Includes non-cancellable agreements for office space and cancellable agreements for drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for hydraulic well-fracturing services and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Due to our various working interests where these service contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	(3) As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	We have work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, natural gas transportation and fulfilling other related commitments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	At December 31, 2011, these work-related commitments totaled $133 million, all of which were attributable to our international business.
912750_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted.
912750_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions, we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	As of December 31, 2011, our delivery commitments through 2020 were as follows:
912750_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Senior Notes In September 2011, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022.
912750_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	We received net proceeds from the offering of $742 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_12_ITEM7_P51_S5	The indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The indenture also provides that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Senior Subordinated Notes In January 2010, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	We received net proceeds from the offering of $686 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S6	We may redeem some or all of our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2014 and our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2016 at any time, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S7	We may redeem some or all of our 7 1 / 8 % notes due 2018 at any time on or after May 15, 2013 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S8	Prior to May 15, 2013, we may redeem all, but not part, of our 7 1 / 8 % notes at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S9	We may redeem some or all of our 6 7 / 8 % notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S10	Prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a make-whole redemption price.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S11	In addition, before February 1, 2013, we may redeem up to 35% of our 6 7 / 8 % notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 106.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_12_ITEM7_P52_S12	The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things:
912750_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets.
912750_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis.
912750_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P54_S5	Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Oil and Gas Hedging As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12-24 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk.
912750_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate hedging arrangements with that counterparty.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	At December 31, 2011, Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of Montreal, J Aron Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to approximately 86% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	A significant number of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are also lenders under our credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	Historically, a majority of our hedged oil and gas production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	The price that we receive for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically averages $0.25-$0.50 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S6	Realized natural gas prices for our Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 90-95% of the Henry Hub Index.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S7	In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 5 Bcf of our natural gas production from January 2012 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S8	In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
912750_12_ITEM7_P58_S9	In the Mid-Continent, we have hedged basis associated with approximately 17 Bcf of our anticipated natural gas production from the Stiles/Britt Ranch area for the period January 2012 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
912750_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The price we receive for our Gulf Coast oil production, excluding NGLs, typically averages about 105-110% of the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price.
912750_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The price we receive for our oil production in the Rocky Mountains, excluding NGLs, is currently averaging about $15-$17 per barrel below the WTI price.
912750_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Oil production from our Mid-Continent properties, excluding NGLs, typically averages 90-95% of the WTI price.
912750_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	Crude oil from our operations in Malaysia typically sells at a slight discount to Tapis, or about 110-115% of WTI.
912750_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	Crude oil from our operations in China typically sells at $10-$15 per barrel greater than the WTI price.
912750_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	We do not designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges.
912750_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience, significant non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had net derivative assets of $137 million, of which 52% was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black-Scholes), and, as such, are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	We value these contracts using a model that considers various inputs including (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	Please see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities below and Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S4	We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S5	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S6	See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S7	For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories.
912750_12_ITEM7_P67_S8	Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category.
912750_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method.
912750_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates:
912750_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company.
912750_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Stock-based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules.
912750_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost.
912750_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment.
912750_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs.
912750_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, costs in effect at year-end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule).
912750_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Final Rule adopted revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on Forms 10-K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010-03), which aligned the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932), with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03 effective December 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	The following critical accounting policies and estimates discussions reflect the new rules unless stated otherwise.
912750_12_ITEM7_P74_S5	See New Accounting Requirements below for a full discussion.
912750_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	Such amounts include the costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals.
912750_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized.
912750_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones.
912750_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.
912750_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development costs, are amortized on a unit-of-production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves.
912750_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	Amortization is calculated separately on a country-by-country basis.
912750_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S4	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S5	Estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DD A expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S6	Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S7	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S8	To change our domestic DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 4%, or 145 Bcfe.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S9	To change our Malaysia DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in Malaysia of approximately 3%, or 4 Bcfe.
912750_12_ITEM7_P78_S10	Since production from our China operations is immaterial, any change in the DD A rate as a result of changes in our proved reserves in China would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	If net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	If required, it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower DD A expense in future periods.
912750_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	The ceiling value of oil and gas reserves is calculated based on the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	The full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting, if any.
912750_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	At December 31, 2011, the ceiling value of our oil and gas reserves was calculated based on the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.13 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Using these prices, the ceiling exceeded the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties by approximately $1.3 billion (net of tax) at December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Holding all other factors constant, if the applicable unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months for both oil and gas were to decline approximately 10% from prices used at December 31, 2011, the excess of our domestic cost center ceiling over our capitalized costs would be reduced by approximately 65%.
912750_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	At December 31, 2011, the Malaysia and China cost center ceilings exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $220 million and $390 million, respectively, net of tax.
912750_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	Holding all other factors constant, it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in Malaysia and China if the applicable unweighted average first-day-of-the-month oil price declined approximately 30% and 50%, respectively, from prices used at December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	At March 31, 2009, prior to our adoption of the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period-end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for natural gas and $49.65 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at March 31, 2009 exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.3 billion ($854 million, after-tax), resulting in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	Given the fluctuation of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	If the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S5	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently being drilled and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S6	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S7	Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S8	If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S9	In addition, a portion of the incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S10	To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled).
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S11	Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S12	Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S13	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S14	At December 31, 2011, we had a total of approximately $2.0 billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S15	The application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2011 resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each full cost pool.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S16	Holding all other factors constant, inclusion of approximately 75% of our domestic unevaluated property costs in the amortization base would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S17	Including all of our Malaysian unevaluated property costs in our Malaysia amortization base would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S18	At December 31, 2011, there were no costs withheld from the amortization base in China.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S19	Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S20	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S21	We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants.
912750_12_ITEM7_P84_S22	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	To change our domestic DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 10%, or $324 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S5	To change our Malaysia DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in Malaysia of approximately 15%, or $16 million.
912750_12_ITEM7_P86_S6	Since production from our China operations is immaterial, any change in the DD A rate as a result of changes in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in China would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date.
912750_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date.
912750_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill.
912750_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.
912750_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	The value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above.
912750_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	The accounting for business combinations changed effective January 1, 2009 and established how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
912750_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction.
912750_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	The standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 31, 2008.
912750_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	Since adoption of the standard, the assets we have acquired have not met the requirements to be accounted for as a business combination.
912750_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12-24 months.
912750_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Since late 2005, we have not designated future price risk management activities as accounting hedges.
912750_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we are likely to experience significant non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative.
912750_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts.
912750_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	For equity-based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock.
912750_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	Additionally, in 2011, we granted cash-settled restricted units that are accounted for under the liability method which require Newfield to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_12_ITEM7_P102_S4	See Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	New Accounting Requirements In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which made fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles, enhanced consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures, and provided greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	The additional guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	We adopted the provisions for the period ended March 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P103_S3	The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
912750_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Although there is new terminology, the guidance was based on the same principles as those that previously existed.
912750_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	This guidance was effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	Our adoption of these provisions beginning with the period ended June 30, 2009 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule).
912750_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	The Final Rule adopted revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on Form 10-K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	The revisions were intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies.
912750_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	The amendments were also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology.
912750_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010-03), which aligned the FASB s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate.
912750_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	Such a change was accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance.
912750_12_ITEM7_P106_S3	Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule were not required.
912750_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, as follows:
912750_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period.
912750_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates.
912750_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices.
912750_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Our full-cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules.
912750_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	We historically have applied a policy of using our year-end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate.
912750_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or the prior years.
912750_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	On April 20, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-14, Accounting for Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (ASU 2010-14), which aligned the oil and gas financial accounting and reporting requirements prescribed by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-14 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons for the transfers and disclosure of major purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S2	The guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S3	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which we adopted for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S4	Adopting the disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S5	In May 2011, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S6	The most significant change will require us, for Level 3 fair value measurements, to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S7	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P113_S8	We do not expect adoption of the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income.
912750_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	The guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity.
912750_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	The guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity s equity.
912750_12_ITEM7_P114_S3	The guidance is retrospective and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P114_S4	We elected early adoption of the provision for the year ended December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM7_P114_S5	Adopting the reporting requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities.
912750_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	The guidance will require disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement.
912750_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
912750_12_ITEM7_P115_S3	We do not expect adoption of the additional disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation.
912750_12_ITEM7_P116_S2	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM7_P116_S3	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12-24 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Item 7 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest Rates At December 31, 2011, our debt was comprised of: We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because approximately 97% of our obligations were at fixed rates.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Our variable rate debt is currently at interest rates of 2% or less.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	For a further discussion of our debt instruments, see the discussion and tables in Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P0_S4	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, the management of our company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newfield Exploration Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of net income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_12_ITEM8_P2_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates the quantities of oil and gas reserves in 2009 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures .
912750_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

912750_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Organization and Principles of Consolidation We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
912750_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our principal domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore Texas.
912750_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	Internationally, we focus on offshore oil developments in Malaysia and China.
912750_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	Our financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_12_ITEM8_P10_S4	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_12_ITEM8_P10_S5	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to Newfield, we, us or our are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Dependence on Oil and Gas Prices As an independent oil and gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil and gas.
912750_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that oil and gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	A substantial or extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital and on the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
912750_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	Our most significant financial estimates are associated with our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and the fair value of our derivative positions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	These reclassifications did not impact our net income, stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	Substantially all of our oil and gas production is sold to a variety of purchasers under short-term contracts (less than 12 months) and, most recently, long-term contracts in the Uinta Basin, at market sensitive prices.
912750_12_ITEM8_P14_S3	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_12_ITEM8_P14_S4	Revenues from the production of oil and gas on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_12_ITEM8_P14_S5	Differences between these sales and our entitled share of production are not significant.
912750_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	Other on our consolidated statement of net income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	Investments Investments consist primarily of debt and equity securities, as well as auction rate securities, a majority of which are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value.
912750_12_ITEM8_P16_S3	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	We realized interest income and net gains on our investment securities in 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $2 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.
912750_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	Generally, our oil and gas receivables are collected within 45 to 60 days of production.
912750_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated.
912750_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Inventories Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and gas operations and oil produced in our operations offshore Malaysia and China but not sold.
912750_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our operations offshore Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	The product inventory consisted of approximately 239,000 barrels and 277,000 barrels of crude oil valued at cost of $19 million and $15 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	Cost for purposes of the carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of production costs and depletion expense.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	Oil and Gas Properties We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S5	We capitalized $113 million, $79 million and $72 million of internal costs in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S6	Interest expense related to unproved properties is also capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P22_S7	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized on a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, a particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Prior to September 30, 2009, the present value (10% per annum discount rate) of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves was calculated using the end of period quoted market prices for oil and gas.
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S3	The risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S4	At December 31, 2011, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.13 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S5	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the U.S., Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P24_S6	As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	At December 31, 2010, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of $4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas and $79.42 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the U.S., Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2010.
912750_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	During the first quarter of 2009, natural gas prices decreased significantly as compared to prices in effect at December 31, 2008.
912750_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	At March 31, 2009, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period-end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for natural gas and $49.65 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials.
912750_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at March 31, 2009 exceeded the ceiling amount and, as a result, we recorded a charge of $1.3 billion ($854 million, after-tax) during the first quarter of 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P26_S3	See Note 3, Oil and Gas Assets, for a detailed discussion regarding our acquisition and sales transactions during 2011, 2010 and 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Other Property and Equipment Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred.
912750_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming the normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for our company.
912750_12_ITEM8_P28_S2	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_12_ITEM8_P28_S3	Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of net income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	The change in our ARO for the three years ended December 31, 2011 is set forth below (in millions): Income Taxes We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions and as such we had not accrued related interest or penalties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	The tax years 2008-2011 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	For equity-based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	Additionally in 2011, we granted cash-settled restricted units that are accounted for under the liability method which require Newfield to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P31_S4	See Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	Our joint interest partners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers.
912750_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	If the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general was adversely affected, the ability of our joint interest partners to reimburse us could be adversely affected.
912750_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The purchasers of our oil and gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Historically, we have sold our oil and gas production to several purchasers.
912750_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The use of hedging transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	We monitor the credit ratings of our hedging counterparties on an ongoing basis.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S3	Although we have entered into hedging contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S4	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S5	At December 31, 2011, Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of Montreal, J Aron Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to 86% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S6	Major Customers Sales of oil and gas production to Royal Dutch Shell plc and Tesoro Corporation accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues in 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S7	No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales of oil and gas production during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S8	During 2009, sales of our oil and gas production to Big West Oil LLC accounted for 16% of our consolidated revenues.
912750_12_ITEM8_P35_S9	We believe that the loss of Royal Dutch Shell plc would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are readily available.
912750_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	yellow wax crude oil, which we produce from this field.
912750_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	Due to the higher paraffin content of this production, it must remain heated during shipping so it cannot be transported in conventional pipelines, and there is limited refining capacity for it in the vicinity of our production.
912750_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	In poor economic environments and tight financial markets, there is an increased risk that the current purchasers of our production may fail to satisfy their obligations to us under our crude oil purchase contracts.
912750_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to sell to these purchasers or that similar substitute arrangements could be made for sales of our black and yellow wax crude oil with other purchasers if desired.
912750_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We account for our derivative activities by applying authoritative accounting and reporting guidance, which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
912750_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	All of the derivative instruments that we utilize are to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production.
912750_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	We have elected not to designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance, and, accordingly, account for them using the mark-to-market accounting method.
912750_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Under this method, the changes in contract values are reported currently in earnings.
912750_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	We also have utilized derivatives to manage our exposure to variable interest rates.
912750_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as well as unrealized gains and losses on investments and changes in post-retirement benefits, all recorded net of tax.
912750_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	As of December 31, 2011, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of an $8 million unrealized loss on investments and a $2 million unrealized loss on post-retirement benefits.
912750_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	As of December 31, 2010, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of an $11 million unrealized loss on investments and a $1 million unrealized loss on post-retirement benefits.
912750_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	New Accounting Requirements In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which made fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles, enhanced consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures, and provided greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The additional guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	We adopted the provisions for the period ended March 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P40_S3	The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
912750_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Although there is new terminology, the guidance was based on the same principles as those that previously existed.
912750_12_ITEM8_P41_S2	This guidance was effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P41_S3	Our adoption of these provisions beginning with the period ended June 30, 2009 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule).
912750_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Final Rule adopted revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on Form 10-K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	The revisions were intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies.
912750_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	The amendments were also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology.
912750_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010-03), which aligned the FASB s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate.
912750_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	Such a change was accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance.
912750_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule were not required.
912750_12_ITEM8_P44_S4	Our adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates.
912750_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices.
912750_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Our full-cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules.
912750_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	We historically have applied a policy of using our year-end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate.
912750_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the first three quarters of 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	On April 20, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-14, Accounting for Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (ASU 2010-14), which aligned the oil and gas financial accounting and reporting requirements prescribed by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-14 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons for the transfers and disclosure of major purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy.
912750_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	The guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
912750_12_ITEM8_P50_S3	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which we adopted for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P50_S4	Adopting the disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	The most significant change will require us, for Level 3 fair value measurements, to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P51_S3	We do not expect adoption of the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	The guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
912750_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	The guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity s equity.
912750_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	The guidance is retrospective and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P52_S4	We elected early adoption of the provision for the year ended December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P52_S5	Adopting the reporting requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	The guidance will require disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement.
912750_12_ITEM8_P53_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
912750_12_ITEM8_P53_S3	We do not expect adoption of the additional disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (other than unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Diluted earnings per share incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	Please see Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011:
912750_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	(1) The calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 does not include the effect of 1.4 million and 0.7 million, respectively, of unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units and stock options because to do so would be anti-dilutive.
912750_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	(2) The effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding has not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2009 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	Had we recognized net income for that period, incremental shares attributable to the assumed exercise of outstanding options and the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units would have increased diluted weighted-average shares outstanding by two million shares for the year ended December 31, 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Oil and Gas Assets: Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following at: Oil and gas properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which we own an interest.
912750_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	These unproved property costs include unevaluated leasehold acreage, geological and geophysical data costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, costs associated with wells currently drilling and capitalized interest.
912750_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	We exclude these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired.
912750_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Unproved property costs are grouped by major prospect area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant.
912750_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	Costs associated with wells in progress are transferred to the amortization base upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results.
912750_12_ITEM8_P59_S2	All other costs excluded from the amortization base are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred.
912750_12_ITEM8_P59_S3	The amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for international operations if a reserve base has not yet been established.
912750_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	The following is a summary of our oil and gas properties not subject to amortization as of December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	We believe that our evaluation activities related to substantially all of our conventional properties not subject to amortization will be completed within four years.
912750_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	Because of the size of our unconventional resource plays, the entire evaluation will take significantly longer than four years.
912750_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	At December 31, 2011, approximately 70% of oil and gas properties not subject to amortization were associated with our unconventional resource plays.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	In February 2010, we acquired certain of TXCO Resources Inc. s assets in the Maverick Basin of southwest Texas for approximately $205 million.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	In the acquisition, we obtained an interest in approximately 300,000 net acres, primarily in the Pearsall and Eagle Ford shale plays, as well as production of 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	Our consolidated financial statements include the cash flows and results of operations for these assets subsequent to the acquisition date.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S3	In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million (includes $4 million in purchase price adjustments).
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S4	The assets include approximately 65,000 net acres, which are largely undeveloped and located north of our Greater Monument Butte field.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S5	Other Asset Acquisitions and Sales During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $1 million, $108 million and $9 million, respectively, and sold various other oil and gas properties for approximately $434 million, $12 million and $33 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S6	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_12_ITEM8_P61_S7	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments: Commodity Derivative Instruments We utilize swap, floor, collar and three-way collar derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production.
912750_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	With respect to a swap contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	For a floor contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	We are not required to make any payment in connection with the settlement of a floor contract.
912750_12_ITEM8_P63_S3	For a collar contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price, we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price and neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	A three-way collar contract consists of a standard collar contract plus a put sold by us with a price below the floor price of the collar.
912750_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	This additional put requires us to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the put price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P64_S2	Combining the collar contract with the additional put results in us being entitled to a net payment equal to the difference between the floor price of the standard collar and the additional put price if the settlement price is equal to or less than the additional put price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P64_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar contract only.
912750_12_ITEM8_P64_S4	This strategy enables us to increase the floor and the ceiling price of the collar beyond the range of a traditional no cost collar while defraying the associated cost with the sale of the additional put.
912750_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	All of our derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	Substantially all of our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, volatility and, in the case of collars and floors, the time value of options.
912750_12_ITEM8_P65_S3	The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_12_ITEM8_P65_S4	Please see Note 7, Fair Value Measurements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	We recognize all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts on a mark-to-market basis in our consolidated statement of net income under the caption Commodity derivative income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	Settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating cash flows on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
912750_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding contracts with respect to our future production that are not designated for hedge accounting as set forth in the tables below.
912750_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Basis Contracts At December 31, 2011, we had natural gas basis contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting to lock in the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points in the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent, as set forth in the table below.
912750_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Interest Rate Swap We previously hedged $50 million principal amount of our $175 million 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 through an interest rate swap.
912750_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	The swap provided for us to pay variable and receive fixed payments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	During the first half of 2010, we repurchased our outstanding 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 and received approximately $2 million upon the termination and settlement of the swap.
912750_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
912750_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in income related to our derivative financial instruments was as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	The total realized gain on commodity derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 differs from the net cash receipts on derivative settlements due to the recognition of option premiums associated with derivatives settled during the respective periods.
912750_12_ITEM8_P72_S2	There were no option premiums recognized during the year ended December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative instruments with that counterparty.
912750_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	At December 31, 2011, Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of Montreal, J Aron Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to approximately 86% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production.
912750_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The counterparties to the majority of our derivative instruments also are lenders under our credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	Our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	As of the indicated dates, our accounts receivable consisted of the following:
912750_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	6. Accrued Liabilities: As of the indicated dates, our accrued liabilities consisted of the following:
912750_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	Fair Value Measurements: Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps and certain investments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	Our valuation methodology for investments is a discounted cash flow model that considers various inputs including: (a) the coupon rate specified under the debt instruments, (b) the current credit ratings of the underlying issuers, (c) collateral characteristics and (d) risk adjusted discount rates.
912750_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as basis swaps, commodity options including, price collars, floors and three-way collars (as of December 31, 2011, our options were comprised of only three-way collars) and some financial investments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Although we utilize third-party broker quotes to assess the reasonableness of our prices and valuation techniques, we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2.
912750_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
912750_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	The following tables summarize the valuation of our investments and financial instrument assets (liabilities) by pricing levels:
912750_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	The determination of the fair values above incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), if any.
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we continued to hold $32 million of auction rate securities maturing beginning in 2033 that are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S2	This amount reflects a decrease in the fair value of these investments of $13 million ($8 million net of tax), recorded under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we held $30 million of auction rate securities, which reflected a decrease in the fair value of $17 million ($11 million net of tax).
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S4	The debt instruments underlying our auction rate securities are mostly investment grade (rated BBB+ or better) and are guaranteed by the United States government or backed by private loan collateral.
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S5	We do not believe the decrease in the fair value of these securities is permanent because we currently intend to hold these investments until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.
912750_12_ITEM8_P87_S6	Our current available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements provides us the liquidity to continue to hold these securities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	The following tables set forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods:
912750_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted market prices as of the indicated dates, was as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	Amounts outstanding under our credit arrangements at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	As of the indicated dates, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	(1) Because capacity under our credit facility was available to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations are classified as long-term.
912750_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	In June 2011, we entered into a new revolving credit facility that matures in June 2016.
912750_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	The terms of the credit facility provide for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of 13 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent.
912750_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	In September 2011, we entered into the first amendment to the credit facility, which allows us to issue senior notes or other debt instruments that are secured equally and ratably with the credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 13% of total commitments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (75 basis points per annum at December 31, 2011) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (175 basis points per annum at December 31, 2011).
912750_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating (30 basis points per annum at December 31, 2011).
912750_12_ITEM8_P95_S2	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our current and previous credit facilities of approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of net income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns, and goodwill impairments) to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S2	Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating (175 basis points at December 31, 2011).
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S4	Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we also have a total of $185 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S5	The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; a change of control; or certain other material adverse changes in our business.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S6	Our senior notes and senior subordinated notes also contain standard events of default.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S7	If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S8	In addition, our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S9	Senior Notes In September 2011, we sold $750 million of 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022 and received proceeds of $742 million (net of discount and offering costs).
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S10	These notes were issued at 99.956% of par to yield 5 3 / 4 %.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S11	We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S12	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_12_ITEM8_P96_S13	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	The indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	The indenture also provides that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	Senior Subordinated Notes In January 2010, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S3	We received net proceeds from the offering of $686 million.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S4	Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S5	The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S6	We may redeem some or all of our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2014 and our 6 5 / 8 % notes due 2016 at any time, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S7	We may redeem some or all of our 7 1 / 8 % notes due 2018 at any time on or after May 15, 2013 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S8	Prior to May 15, 2013, we may redeem all, but not part, of these notes at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S9	We may redeem some or all of our 6 7 / 8 % notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S10	Prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem some or all of these notes at a make-whole redemption price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S11	In addition, before February 1, 2013, we may redeem up to 35% of these notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 106.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_12_ITEM8_P99_S12	The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things:
912750_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets.
912750_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	Income Taxes: For the indicated periods, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	For the indicated periods, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 was different than the amount computed using the federal statutory rate (35%) for the following reasons:
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	As of the indicated dates, the components of our deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability were as follows: As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $2 billion for federal income tax and $1 billion for state income tax purposes, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S1	NOL carryforwards of $273 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S2	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $127 million of our various gross state NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S3	To the extent not utilized, the NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2031.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S4	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had gross NOL carryforwards for international income tax purposes of approximately $48 million and $29 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated international NOL carryforwards of $31 million and utilized international NOLs of $12 million which were generated in 2010.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S6	Our international NOLs must be utilized during the term of the respective production sharing contract in the appropriate jurisdiction.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S7	In addition, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $17 million of international NOLs, which we currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P104_S8	As a result, valuation allowances were established for these items in 2005 and 2006.
912750_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	Utilization of NOL carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices, estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing NOL carryforwards.
912750_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	The rollforward of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	In 2011, we recorded a $5 million valuation allowance related to various NOLs which were generated in certain of the states where we conduct operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P108_S1	In 2009, we reversed the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset associated with our fourth quarter 2008 ceiling test writedown in Malaysia.
912750_12_ITEM8_P108_S2	The valuation allowance was released as a result of a substantial increase in our estimate of future taxable income in Malaysia due to increases in anticipated future crude oil prices.
912750_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	U.S. deferred taxes have not been recorded with respect to foreign income of $39 million that is permanently reinvested internationally.
912750_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	We currently do not have any foreign tax credits available to reduce U.S. taxes on this income if it was repatriated.
912750_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	Stock-Based Compensation: On May 5, 2011, at our 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved the Newfield Exploration Company 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan (the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan), and our 2009 Omnibus Stock Plan and 2009 Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan were terminated such that no new grants will be made under the previous plans.
912750_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	All stock-based compensation equity awards to employees and non-employee directors will be granted under the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	Outstanding awards under those previous plans were not impacted by the termination of those previous plans.
912750_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	In February 2011, we also granted cash-settled restricted stock units to employees that were not issued under any of our plans as they will be settled in cash upon vesting and are accounted for as liability awards.
912750_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	We issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	Beginning in 2009, we began to primarily utilize treasury shares when restricted stock is issued or restricted stock units vest.
912750_12_ITEM8_P112_S2	Shares available for grant under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan are reduced by 1.87 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan, and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P112_S3	At December 31, 2011, we had approximately (1) 6.3 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing employee and director plans if all future employee awards under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan are stock options, or (2) 3.4 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing employee and director plans if all future employee awards under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_12_ITEM8_P112_S4	Thus far, the majority of the awards under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan have been granted as restricted stock unit awards.
912750_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	As of the indicated dates, our stock-based compensation consisted of the following:
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	The excess tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital and is calculated as the amount by which the tax deduction we receive exceeds the deferred tax asset associated with recorded stock-based compensation expense.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	We did not realize an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation for 2011, 2010 or 2009 because we did not have sufficient taxable income to fully realize the deduction.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S2	At December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized net operating losses of $122 million related to stock-based compensation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $81 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S4	This compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S5	The full amount is expected to be recognized within approximately five years.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S6	We have granted stock options under several plans.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S7	Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S8	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
912750_12_ITEM8_P114_S9	The following table provides information about stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
912750_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	(1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of our common stock at the indicated date, or at the time of exercise, exceeds the exercise price of the option.
912750_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	On December 31, 2011, the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $37.73 per share.
912750_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2011: Restricted Stock.
912750_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	At December 31, 2011, our employees held an aggregate of 2.2 million shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that primarily vest over a service period of three to five years.
912750_12_ITEM8_P117_S1	The vesting of these shares and units is dependent upon the employee s continued service with our company.
912750_12_ITEM8_P117_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2011, our employees held 0.3 million shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting criteria (substantially all of which are considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_12_ITEM8_P117_S3	The following table provides information about restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
912750_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $32 million, $39 million and $15 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	During the first quarter of 2011, we granted cash-settled restricted stock units to employees that vest over three years.
912750_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	The value of the awards, and the associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company s stock price.
912750_12_ITEM8_P119_S2	As of December 31, 2011, 132,065 cash-settled restricted stock units were outstanding.
912750_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	Pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, for each six month period beginning on January 1 or July 1 during the term of the plan, each eligible employee has the opportunity to purchase our common stock for a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the period or the last day of the period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P120_S1	No employee may purchase common stock under the plan valued at more than $25,000 in any calendar year.
912750_12_ITEM8_P120_S2	Employees of our foreign subsidiaries are not eligible to participate in the plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	At our May 7, 2010 annual meeting, our stockholders approved the Newfield Exploration Company 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P121_S1	This plan replaced our 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was terminated on June 30, 2010.
912750_12_ITEM8_P121_S2	This plan became effective July 1, 2010 with one million shares of our common stock available for issuance.

912750_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	Pension Plan Obligation: As a result of our acquisition of EEX Corporation in November 2002, we assumed responsibility for a defined benefit pension plan for current and former employees of EEX and its subsidiaries.
912750_12_ITEM8_P123_S1	The plan was amended, effective March 31, 2003, to cease all future retirement benefit accruals.
912750_12_ITEM8_P123_S2	We filed for a standard termination with a proposed plan termination date of April 30, 2008.
912750_12_ITEM8_P123_S3	A favorable determination letter was received on March 16, 2009 from the Internal Revenue Service.
912750_12_ITEM8_P123_S4	During the second half of 2009, we completed the formal termination process and all participants received full payment of their obligation through an annuity purchase or a lump sum payment.
912750_12_ITEM8_P123_S5	Curtailment accounting was applied for year-end 2009 resulting in a charge of $3 million recorded to general and administrative expense associated with changes in the pension liability due to actual plan termination costs.
912750_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	We sponsor a post-retirement medical plan that covers all retired employees until they reach age 65.
912750_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	At December 31, 2011, both our accumulated benefit obligation and our accrued benefit costs were $11 million.

912750_12_ITEM8_P124_S3	The expected future benefit payments under our post-retirement medical plan for the next ten years are as follows (in millions):
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan During 2010, our Board of Directors, with the recommendation of the Compensation Management Development Committee approved a new annual cash incentive compensation plan for all employees (the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan).
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S1	Under the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Management Development Committee determines the annual award pool for all employees based upon a number of factors including the Company s performance against stated performance goals and in comparison with peer companies in our industry.
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S2	All employees are eligible if employed on October 1 and December 31 of the performance period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S3	Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2010, our annual cash incentive compensation is paid in a single payment to employees during the first quarter after the end of the performance period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S4	Incentive compensation awards for periods prior to 2010 were made under our 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S5	That plan provided for the creation of an award pool that was equal to 5% of our adjusted net income (as defined in the plan) and it was administered by the Compensation Management Development Committee.
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S6	Awards under the plan could have both a current and a long-term component with the long-term cash awards being paid in four annual installments consisting of 25% of the long-term award, plus interest.
912750_12_ITEM8_P125_S7	Total incentive compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $39 million, $36 million and $28 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	401(k) and Deferred Compensation Plans We sponsor a 401(k) profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S1	This plan covers all of our employees other than employees of our foreign subsidiaries.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S2	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the IRS.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S3	We also sponsor a highly compensated employee deferred compensation plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S4	This non-qualified plan allows an eligible employee to defer a portion of his or her salary or bonus on an annual basis.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S5	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the plan.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S6	Our contribution with respect to each participant in the deferred compensation plan is reduced by the amount of contribution made by us to our 401(k) plan for that participant.
912750_12_ITEM8_P126_S7	Our combined contributions to these two plans for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $8 million, $6 million and $5 million, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	Commitments and Contingencies: Lease Commitments We have various commitments under non-cancellable operating lease agreements for office space and firm transportation.

912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	Other Commitments As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities.
912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S3	We have work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, transportation of our production and fulfilling other related commitments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S4	At December 31, 2011, these work-related commitments totaled $133 million, all of which were attributable to our international business.
912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S5	We also have various commitments for drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S6	The majority of these commitments are related to contracts for hydraulic well fracturing services and drilling rigs and payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P127_S7	As of December 31, 2011, future payments under these agreements are approximately $256 million in 2012, $84 million in 2013, $11 million in 2014 and $3 million in 2015.
912750_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	payments, (2) commercial disputes, (3) personal injury claims and (4) property damage claims.
912750_12_ITEM8_P129_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	Segment Information: While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are organizationally structured along geographic operating segments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P130_S1	Our current operating segments are the United States, Malaysia, China and Other International.
912750_12_ITEM8_P130_S2	The accounting policies of each of our operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
912750_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P131_S1	Income tax allocations have been determined based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment.
912750_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	Related Party Transaction: Susan G. Riggs, our Treasurer, is a minority owner of Huffco International L.L.C. (Huffco).
912750_12_ITEM8_P132_S1	In May 1997, before Ms. Riggs joined us, we acquired from Huffco an entity now known as Newfield China, LDC, the owner of a 12% interest in a three field unit located on Blocks 04/36 and 05/36 in Bohai Bay, offshore China.
912750_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	respect to exploration and production in Block 05/36, plus the cash purchase price we paid Huffco for Newfield China ($6 million).
912750_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Newfield China paid $5 million, $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of dividends to Huffco on the preferred shares of Newfield China.
912750_12_ITEM8_P133_S2	Based on our estimate of the net present value of the proved reserves associated with Block 05/36, the indirect interest (through Huffco) in Newfield China s preferred shares held by Ms. Riggs had a net present value of approximately $240,000 at December 31, 2011.
912750_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited): The results of operations by quarter for the indicated periods are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	(1) The sum of the individual quarterly earnings (loss) per share may not agree with year-to-date earnings (loss) per share as each quarterly computation is based on the income or loss for that quarter and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter.
912750_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES UNAUDITED Costs Incurred Costs incurred for oil and gas property acquisitions, exploration and development for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	(3) Other items impacting the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties which are not included in total costs incurred are as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES UNAUDITED (Continued) Capitalized Costs Capitalized costs for our oil and gas producing activities consisted of the following at the end of each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011:
912750_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	Reserves Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_12_ITEM8_P139_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P139_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the Final Rule adopting revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements.
912750_12_ITEM8_P140_S1	In addition, in January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-03, which aligned the FASB s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC s Final Rule.
912750_12_ITEM8_P140_S2	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies New Accounting Requirements .
912750_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010-03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate.
912750_12_ITEM8_P141_S1	Such a change was accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance.
912750_12_ITEM8_P141_S2	Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule were not required.
912750_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES UNAUDITED (Continued) Our adoption of ASU 2010-03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as follows:
912750_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period.
912750_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates.
912750_12_ITEM8_P143_S2	Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices.
912750_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	Our full-cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules.
912750_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	We historically have applied a policy of using our year-end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate.
912750_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or the prior year.
912750_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_12_ITEM8_P146_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.
912750_12_ITEM8_P146_S2	The technical employee responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, with more than 30 years of experience (including 20 years of experience in reserve estimation).
912750_12_ITEM8_P146_S3	For additional information regarding our reserves estimation process, please see Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Reserves.
912750_12_ITEM8_P146_S4	The following is a discussion of our proved reserves and reserve additions and revisions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	Our proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2011 were 2.3 Tcf compared to 2.5 Tcf at year-end 2010 and 2.6 Tcf at year-end 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S1	Our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year-end 2011 were 263 million barrels compared to 204 million barrels at year-end 2010 and 169 million barrels at year-end 2009.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S2	Natural gas comprised about 60%, 67% and 72% of our proved reserves at year-end 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S3	During 2011, we added 621 Bcfe net proved reserves as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases of reserves in place) and revisions, as described below.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S4	We expect the majority of future reserve additions to be associated with infill drilling, extensions of current fields and new discoveries, as well as improved recovery operations and purchases of proved properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S5	The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S6	We added 857 Bcfe of proved reserves through discoveries, extensions and other additions, and 52 Bcfe through purchases.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S7	Drilling additions related primarily to activities in our resource plays in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S8	Of the drilling additions, 430 Bcfe or 72 million BOE were proved undeveloped additions in the Rocky Mountains, associated primarily with the Williston Basin and Monument Butte field.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S9	In addition, 16 million barrels of oil of proved developed reserves were added reflecting our continued focus on higher margin oil projects.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S10	We added 676 Bcfe of proved reserves during 2010.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S11	Approximately 414 Bcfe of the additions resulted from successful development drilling, primarily in our Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain divisions, where we added 322 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves primarily associated with our Woodford Shale, Williston Basin and Monument Butte fields.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S12	In addition, during 2010, extensions and other additions totaled 236 Bcfe, reflecting the shift in our investment strategy from natural gas to higher margin oil projects.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S13	We added 1,342 Bcfe of proved reserves during 2009, approximately 521 Bcfe of which were the result of successful development drilling in our Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain business units.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S14	Domestic extensions, discoveries and other additions also included 693 Bcfe of additions resulting from the change in the SEC definition of proved reserves, expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond one direct offset away from producing wells.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S15	These locations were primarily in the Woodford Shale and Monument Butte fields.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S16	Our total proved reserve revisions in 2011 were 288 Bcfe.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S17	Price-related and other revisions were negligible.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S18	Of proved undeveloped reserves, 87 Bcfe were reclassified to probable reserves as we directed capital to higher margin oil drilling and the locations associated with these reserves moved outside of a five-year development horizon.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S19	Negative performance revisions in 2011 were 198 Bcfe, which included (i) well performance as efforts to extend the Monument Butte-Green River section to the northwest encountered higher than expected natural gas production, (ii) the timing of waterflood response recognition in Monument Butte, (iii) wellbore failures in gas reservoirs along the Gulf Coast and (iv) offset well interference in older vertical natural gas wells in the Mid-Continent, which were adversely impacted by new horizontal well completions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S20	Our revisions in 2010 include the reclassification of approximately 315 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves (nearly all Mid-Continent natural gas reserves) to probable reserves because a slower pace of development activity placed them beyond the five-year development horizon.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S21	This change reflected a shift in our investment strategy toward oil projects.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S22	Excluding this reclassification, our revisions were 26 Bcfe, consisting of positive price-related revisions of 56 Bcfe, partially offset by 30 Bcfe of performance-related revisions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S23	Total revisions in 2009 were a negative 384 Bcfe, or 13% of the beginning of year reserve base.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S24	The revisions included a negative price revision of 259 Bcfe primarily related to our onshore natural gas plays, such as the Woodford Shale, and were primarily proved undeveloped reserves.
912750_12_ITEM8_P147_S25	The remaining 125 Bcfe of revisions in 2009 were negative performance revisions and were principally proved developed producing reserve revisions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES UNAUDITED (Continued) Sales.
912750_12_ITEM8_P148_S1	In 2011, we sold 122 Bcfe of proved reserves associated with non-strategic properties.
912750_12_ITEM8_P148_S2	In 2010, sales of reserves were negligible.
912750_12_ITEM8_P148_S3	During 2009, we sold approximately 35 Bcfe of reserves associated with our domestic operations.
912750_12_ITEM8_P148_S4	The following table sets forth our total net proved reserves and our total net proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and the changes in our total net proved reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011:
912750_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	(1) All of our reserves in Malaysia and China are associated with production sharing contracts and are calculated using the economic interest method.
912750_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	(2) Effective December 31, 2009, the SEC changed the definition of proved reserves, expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond one direct offset away from producing wells.
912750_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	The following information was developed utilizing procedures prescribed by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932).
912750_12_ITEM8_P151_S1	The information is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_12_ITEM8_P151_S2	The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be viewed as representative of the current value of our proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_12_ITEM8_P151_S3	It and the other information contained in the following tables may be useful for certain comparative purposes, but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating us or our performance.
912750_12_ITEM8_P151_S4	In reviewing the information that follows, we believe that the following factors should be taken into account:
912750_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	future net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation.
912750_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	Under the standardized measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying the prices used in estimating our proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves.
912750_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	Future cash inflows do not reflect the impact of open hedge positions.
912750_12_ITEM8_P154_S1	See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments.
912750_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on year-end costs in order to arrive at net cash flows before tax.
912750_12_ITEM8_P155_S1	Future income tax expense has been computed by applying year-end statutory tax rates to aggregate future pre-tax net cash flows reduced by the tax basis of the properties involved and tax carryforwards.
912750_12_ITEM8_P155_S2	The standardized measure is derived from using a discount rate of 10% a year to reflect the timing of future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

912750_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Oil, gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, gas and NGLs.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Lower prices may reduce the amount of oil, gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Oil, gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	The market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulation.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Significant declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	reducing the carrying value of our assets.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that we expect to be greater than cash flows from operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We anticipate that our 2013 capital investment levels will exceed our estimate of cash flows from operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We expect to sell non-strategic assets and use available capacity under our credit arrangements to fund the shortfall.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected if:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	our customers or working interest owners default on their obligations to us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Actual quantities of oil, gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Estimating accumulations of oil, gas and NGLs is complex.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The proved and probable reserve information set forth in this report is based on our prepared estimates.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Actual quantities of oil, gas and NGL reserves, future production, oil, gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates, with the variability likely to be higher for probable reserves estimates.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S7	In addition, we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities and prevailing oil, gas and NGL prices.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S9	You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P7_S10	In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on SEC pricing, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year-end.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	This is called a ceiling test writedown.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We recorded a ceiling test writedown of approximately $1.5 billion ($948 million after-tax) at December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Although a ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flows from operations, it does reduce our stockholders equity.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may experience further ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in the future.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The risk that we will be required to further writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Drilling is a high-risk activity .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Further, offshore and deepwater operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoon or other adverse weather conditions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our international operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In connection with our operations, we generally require our contractors, which include the contractor, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliate companies, its subcontractors, their agents, employees, directors and officers, to agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees, contractors and subcontractors and any property damage suffered by the contractors.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The occurrence of any of the foregoing events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage or not indemnified, could reduce revenue and the funds available to us for our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	See also We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource damages and other environmental damages.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Further, changes to existing environmental regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers or our customers.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	For example, governments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in some manner.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In the absence of dedicated federal legislation to address climate change mitigation, the U.S. EPA has taken several actions and rulemakings to regulate, measure or monitor GHG emissions under the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, or CAA.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, as well as from certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities on an annual basis.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The new regulations could impact certain facilities in which we have interests (legal, equitable, operated or non-operated) by increasing regulatory risks and reporting requirements.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In December 2009, the U.S. EPA also issued an endangerment finding under the CAA concluding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere from motor vehicles threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The finding, once made, required the EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions from new cars and light trucks under the CAA.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Indirectly, it also triggered the EPA s obligation to regulate GHG emissions under existing relevant air permitting programs for large stationary sources.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	On January 2, 2011, the EPA initiated Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting requirements for carbon dioxide and other GHGs from large and modified stationary sources.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Permits limiting GHGs have been issued for a variety of new or modified facilities under the Clean Air Act PSD program.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	GHG emissions also trigger Title V operating permit requirements for new and existing sources that exceed certain established emission thresholds.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	The PSD permitting requirement is triggered when a new or modified facility emits specified levels of GHGs (e.g., 75,000-100,000 tons per year).
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Emission levels in excess of these thresholds can then trigger preconstruction permit requirements and application of best available control technology (BACT) as determined on a source-by-source basis.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S8	In most cases, based on cost, the BACT compliance option selected for GHGs is increased energy efficiency.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S9	In addition, the U.S. Congress continues to consider adopting tax, energy or environmental market-based mechanisms to promote or require the reduction of GHG emissions from certain industrial sectors.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Any such legislation or regulatory programs, depending on design and scope, could increase the cost of oil and gas production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S11	Some states like California have implemented state-wide GHG mitigation programs to reduce GHG emissions through a mixture of regulatory programs, including a low carbon fuel standard and cap-and-trade market applicable to, among others, electric utilities and transportation fuels.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S12	Further, the U.S. Congress has previously proposed legislation that would directly impact our industry.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S13	In response to the 2010 Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Congress was considering a number of legislative proposals relating to the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and offshore that could result in significant additional laws or regulations governing our operations in the United States, including a proposal to raise or eliminate the cap on liability for oil spill cleanups under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S14	These and other potential regulations, if introduced and passed in Congress, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P24_S15	See also The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other hydrocarbon products that we produce.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties, including our unconventional resource plays in the Woodford Shale of Oklahoma, the Granite Wash of Texas and Oklahoma, the Uinta Basin of Utah and the Eagle Ford and Pearsall shales of southwest Texas, which represented approximately 64% of our proved reserves and approximately 67% of our probable reserves at year-end 2012.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT) and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process, and the RCT adopted rules regarding the same in December 2011.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	On September 11, 2012, the RCT approved new regulations relating to the commercial recycling of produced water and/or hydraulic-fracturing flowback fluid, and on December 17, 2012, proposed revised amendments to rules of casing, cementing, well control and completion of oil and gas wells.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	In the past three years, news reports indicate that at least 23 states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P27_S7	In the event state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Notwithstanding state regulatory requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing, there are steps by federal governmental agencies that are either underway or are being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and recently released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, on May 11, 2012, the BLM issued a proposed rule that would require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, set requirements for well-bore integrity and establish flowback water standards for all hydraulic fracturing operations on federal public lands and American Indian Tribal lands.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	design complies with all federal, state, tribal and local regulations; (b) the stimulation was completed in accordance with the design approved by BLM and all applicable regulations; and (c) the well-bore integrity was maintained during the fracturing process and flowback water was properly stored, treated and disposed.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	On January 22, 2013, however, BLM withdrew the proposed disclosure rule and intends to release a revised proposal in 2013.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with initial results in 2013 and final results by 2014.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In a November 18, 2011 report, the Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board issued 20 recommendations to federal agencies, states and private entities that are intended to reduce the environmental impact and assure the safety of shale gas production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Given the heightened awareness regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing, it is possible that regulatory agencies or private parties may suggest that hydraulic fracturing has caused groundwater contamination, whether or not such allegations are accurate.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	For example, on December 8, 2011, the EPA released a preliminary report indicating that hydraulic fracturing is responsible for groundwater contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, although the EPA s draft report has been hotly criticized as ignoring certain facts and utilizing incorrect data.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, the EPA has alleged in an enforcement action against an operator in Texas that the operator contaminated local groundwater wells, although the RTC found after an evidentiary hearing that the operator was not responsible for the contamination.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Thus, regulatory agencies or private parties alleging groundwater contamination linked to hydraulic fracturing could trigger defense costs in administrative or civil litigation to rebut the allegations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Additionally, certain members of the Congress have called upon (a) the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, (b) the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and (c) the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	These on-going or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Further, on August 16, 2012, the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Specifically, the EPA finalized rules under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S9	The EPA regulations include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically-fractured gas wells.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S10	Before January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion either by flaring using a completion combustion device or by capturing the gas using green completions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P30_S11	After January 1, 2015, operators must capture the gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Further, the regulations under NESHAPS include specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We are currently evaluating the effect these regulations could have on our business.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Compliance with such regulations could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	and gas production activities using hydraulic-fracturing techniques.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S7	We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S8	In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Our use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S10	As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24 to 36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S11	As of December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S12	In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S13	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the relevant underlying commodity reference prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S14	While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P32_S15	Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the hedged volume or there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge transaction.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Reform Act) was enacted to establish federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and over entities, such as Newfield, that participate in that market.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The Dodd-Frank Reform Act includes provisions that require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has begun to formally determine the types of swaps that will be subject to the mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end-users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If our swap activities are not exempt from mandatory clearing or exchange trading, or from margin requirements for uncleared swaps, we could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for those activities.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	There are substantial costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Reform Act that create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risk associated with anticipated production of oil and gas.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules and regulations promulgated by CFTC could potentially increase the cost of Newfield s swap contracts (including through requirements to post margin or collateral for cleared and uncleared swaps, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of our swap contracts, reduce the availability of swaps to hedge or mitigate risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing swap contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, or our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The CFTC also adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Reform Act to expand aggregate position limits to include certain swaps that are economically equivalent to certain types of commodity futures, including specified energy commodity futures and related transactions, which would apply to swap transactions in which we engage beyond certain thresholds.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would have been exempt from those limits, and the rules could require additional oversight monitoring and reporting.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In September 2012, a U.S. federal district court vacated the position limits regulations and remanded them to the CFTC for additional action.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	On November 15, 2012, CFTC filed a notice of appeal of that court decision.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If the position limit regulations are ultimately reinstated or readopted substantially in the form originally adopted, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Unless we establish production in paying quantities on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire and we will lose the right to develop the related properties.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These changes include, among other proposals:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These proposals were also included in President Obama s Proposed Fiscal Year 2013 Budget.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The passage of such legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. Federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	There is limited transportation and refining capacity for our black and yellow wax crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell our current production or to increase our production in the Uinta Basin.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	content than crude oil found in most other major North American basins.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Due to its wax content, the oil is heated in the field and transported in insulated trucks during shipping.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	At this time, our transportation options are limited.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Substantially all of our production is transported by truck to refiners in the Salt Lake City area.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We are exploring the feasibility of transporting future oil volumes by rail or pipeline.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We currently have agreements in place with area refiners that secure base load sales of substantially all of our expected production in the Uinta Basin through the end of 2013.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, we have executed long-term supply agreements (7 and 10 years) with Tesoro and HollyFrontier, who are expanding their local refineries.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Our commitments begin in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S6	The inability of Tesoro or HollyFrontier to complete their expansions or an extended loss of any of our largest purchasers or inability to secure new markets outside of the Salt Lake City area could have a material adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of our black and yellow wax crude oil.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S7	The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P43_S8	The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	We have risks associated with our non-U.S. operations .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our international operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Exploration in international deepwater involves significant financial risks, and we may be unable to obtain the drilling rigs or support services necessary for our deepwater drilling and development programs in a timely manner or at acceptable rates .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Much of our international deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and requires substantial capital investment, and it is difficult to estimate the timing of our production.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Because of the size of significant projects in which we invest, we may not serve as the operator.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S4	As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations related to these projects or their associated costs.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital or lead to unexpected future losses.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Competition for experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S7	Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S8	Competition for these professionals remains strong.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P47_S9	We are likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and retain these professionals.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our competitors include national oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	In addition, high commodity prices and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S4	We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S7	As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for certain drilling rights if our competitors are seeking the same.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S8	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S10	See also The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S11	We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S12	Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S13	Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S14	Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S15	We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S16	We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability and other coverages.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S17	Consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P48_S18	For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).
912750_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Inspections will not likely be performed on every well or facility, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We depend on computer and telecommunications systems and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility .
912750_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	These restrictions could limit our ability to:
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these ratios and conditions.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S4	This failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions, even if sufficient funds were available.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S6	If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S7	Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our Company.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S8	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change of control of our Company, to acquire us or to replace incumbent management.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P58_S9	In addition, our change of control severance plan and agreements and our omnibus stock plans contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, upon a change of control.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
912750_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of our Company.
912750_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	under EPA jurisdiction that are located at our Monument Butte field in Duchesne County, Utah (Monument Butte).
912750_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The injection wells are part of an enhanced oil recovery project designed to optimize production from Monument Butte.
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	Regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) require operators of injection wells to file proof of financial assurance annually to cover the costs to plug and abandon the injection wells.
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The NOV alleges that our 2010 and 2009 filings (for 2009 and 2008) did not meet the financial ratio tests that are acceptable as one form of required financial assurance under SDWA regulations.
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	The NOV was completely administrative in nature and did not contain any allegations of environmental spills, releases or pollution.
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	Upon receipt of the NOV, we promptly complied with the EPA s request to put in place alternate financial assurance for the wells even though we in fact believed we did meet the financial ratio tests.
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	We held preliminary discussions with the EPA regarding potential settlement of this matter; however, the EPA determined that the NOV could not be resolved within the EPA s settlement authority under the SDWA and required a referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ).
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	We intend to vigorously defend against the DOJ s allegations.
912750_13_ITEM3_P1_S6	Although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the names of, ages (as of February 20, 2013) of and positions held by our executive officers.

912750_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	dividends were reinvested on the relevant payment dates.
912750_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	For 2012, we decided to update our peer group to be consistent with the peer group used by the Company to compare executive compensation and determine total stockholder return under its 2012 performance stock awards granted to executives.

912750_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	selected consolidated financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements and selected reserve data derived from our supplementary oil and gas disclosures set forth in Item 8 of this report.
912750_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Reserves and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.
912750_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Effective December 31, 2009, we adopted revised authoritative accounting and disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC for oil and gas reserves.
912750_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	As a result, certain 2008 disclosures and amounts are not on a basis comparable to other periods presented.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our principal domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore Gulf Coast.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Internationally, we focus on offshore oil developments in Malaysia and China.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	In February 2013, we initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to our international businesses.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and affect:
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	In addition, we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these assets, are capitalized.
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	The net capitalized costs for our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	If these costs exceed the limit, we are required to charge the excess to earnings, also referred to as a ceiling test writedown.
912750_13_ITEM7_P1_S6	As of December 31, 2012, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.5 billion ($948 million, after-tax).
912750_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The risk of incurring a ceiling test writedown increases when commodity prices are low for a sustained period of time.
912750_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	If there are further declines in SEC pricing, we may be required to record a ceiling test writedown in future periods.
912750_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs and do not include the effects of the settlements of our derivative positions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Please see Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold.
912750_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition, substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs or onshore storage terminals, and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into the FPSO.
912750_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	As a result, the timing of liftings may impact period-to-period results.
912750_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, our revenues were up $96 million, or 4%, over 2011 and reflect our continued focus on increasing our liquids production and allowing our natural gas production to decline.
912750_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Oil production was up 24% in 2012, and when combined with slightly higher prices, added an additional $431 million compared to 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Substantially offsetting the uplift in revenues from oil were lower gas prices and volumes that resulted in $326 million less gas revenues in 2012 compared to 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	Increased NGL production of 30% was more than offset by a 30% decline in NGL prices during the year.
912750_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	For 2011, approximately half of the increase in revenue was due to higher average realized oil prices and half of the increase resulted from increased oil production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	The following table reflects our production and average realized commodity prices for each of the years ended December 31.
912750_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	(2) Historically, we reported natural gas liquid (NGL) volumes combined with oil and condensate production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Effective in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, we began reporting NGL production separately from crude oil and condensate production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	As such, all production volumes and average realized prices for periods prior to 2012 have been reclassified for comparability between periods.
912750_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our 2012 domestic oil, natural gas and NGL production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, decreased 9% compared to 2011 production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	The decrease relates primarily to the sale of assets in the Gulf of Mexico and natural declines in our natural gas assets due to lack of investment as our investments have been focused on oil and liquids projects.
912750_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	Our domestic oil and liquids production increased approximately 13% in 2012 when compared to the prior year.
912750_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our 2011 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 2% over 2010 production primarily due to increased production of 8% in our Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent regions as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts, partially offset by production decreases in our onshore Gulf Coast region and Gulf of Mexico deepwater operations due to natural field decline and weather- and equipment-related delays.
912750_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our 2012 international oil production increased by 48% over 2011 levels primarily due to an increase of 53% in Malaysia production resulting from continued successful drilling on our East Belamut field, as well as full-year production on our East Piatu and Puteri fields, brought online during the fourth quarter of 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our 2011 international oil production increased over 2010 levels primarily due to an increase in production of 13% in Malaysia as a result of new field developments from our East Piatu and East Belamut fields and the timing of liftings.
912750_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 The following table compares information about our operating expenses between the following periods: Domestic Operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Excluding the ceiling test writedown, the increase in our depletion rate due to price related downward reserve revisions and the impact of selling our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, our operating expenses increased 21%.
912750_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Recurring LOE increased $0.05 per Mcfe to $0.93 per Mcfe.
912750_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase was due to higher compression, fuel, electricity, and rental equipment costs coupled with declining natural gas production in our Mid-Continent region.
912750_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Partially offsetting this increase was improved recurring LOE per unit in our Rocky Mountain and Onshore Gulf Coast regions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Increases in our non-recurring LOE of $42 million accounted for 87% of the increase in total domestic LOE primarily due to the following:
912750_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	repairs to plugged flow lines in our deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations, which were subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2012, was the primary driver of an additional increase of $12 million in non-recurring LOE; and Transportation costs related to firm transportation agreements in our Mid-Continent region accounted for $0.08 per Mcfe of the increase.
912750_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our average depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) rate increased $0.50 per Mcfe during 2012 and reflects our continued focus on oil and liquids rich gas developments that are more capital intensive on a per Mcfe basis as compared to natural gas developments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	While our average DD A rate in 2011 was $2.46, our rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $2.58.
912750_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	During 2012, this rate increased as the additional cost of each Mcfe added was higher.
912750_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	In addition, the full year average rate was negatively impacted by downward reserve revisions (primarily due to natural gas price declines) combined with the net impact of selling our remaining Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Without these items, our average DD A rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been $2.89.
912750_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	General and administrative (G A) expense per Mcfe increased during 2012 primarily due to employee-related expenses associated with our domestic work force combined with lower domestic production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	During 2012, we capitalized $95 million ($0.41 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $83 million ($0.33 per Mcfe) during 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.5 billion ($6.44 per Mcfe) due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The primary reason for the change in value was negative price-related reserve revisions as a result of a 33% decrease in the natural gas SEC pricing.
912750_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Other expenses of $15 million ($0.06 per Mcfe) include a writedown of $8 million of subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets and contract termination costs of $6 million in consideration of other services.
912750_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our international operating expenses for 2012, stated on a Mcfe basis, decreased 13% over 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The components of the period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	LOE per Mcfe decreased by 24% ($0.57 per Mcfe) primarily due to lower non-recurring workover activity during 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Recurring LOE was essentially flat on a per unit basis with a decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe, or 1%.
912750_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe decreased by 30% due to an overall change in the mix of production that was lifted and sold from the various PSCs in Malaysia including the fields brought online during the fourth quarter of 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The production tax rates per barrel of oil lifted and sold from these newer developments are lower, per the terms of our PSCs, while we recover our costs associated with these developments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	when compared to the end of year 2011 rate of $4.17 was 7% higher and was primarily due to the costs of two unsuccessful wells offshore Malaysia, which increased the amount subject to depletion without any associated reserve additions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 The following table presents information comparing our operating expenses for the following periods: Domestic Operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our domestic operating expenses for 2011, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 22% over those for 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in domestic LOE per Mcfe resulted from a 50% ($0.26 per Mcfe) increase in the normally recurring portion of our LOE.
912750_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Recurring LOE in our Rocky Mountains region accounted for approximately 60% of the increase due to increased water handling and overall operating and service-related costs in the basins in which we operate.
912750_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	In addition, LOE increased ($0.08 per Mcfe) due to increased transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts in our Mid-Continent region throughout 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased due to a 21% increase in realized oil prices in 2011, coupled with a 4% increase in oil and natural gas production subject to production taxes.
912750_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Since late 2009, the shift of our capital investments toward the oil plays in our portfolio has resulted in an increase in our DD A rate.
912750_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase in total DD A expense is related to the increase in the DD A rate, coupled with a slight increase in our production volumes during 2011 compared to 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	G A expense per Mcfe increased during 2011 due to employee-related expenses associated with the growth we experienced in our domestic workforce and approximately $7 million of legal expenses related to litigation in which we were the plaintiff.
912750_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	During 2011, we capitalized $83 million ($0.33 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $61 million ($0.25 per Mcfe) during 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of $7 million ($0.03 per Mcfe) related to certain claims related to the bankruptcy proceedings associated with TXCO Resources Inc.
912750_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our international operating expenses for 2011, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 63% over 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The components of the period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	LOE per Mcfe increased due to non-recurring pipeline and facilities repair in Malaysia, fixed production costs associated with certain of our PSCs in Malaysia and increased overall operating service costs from the various PSCs during 2011 compared to 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased due to an increase, per the terms of the PSCs, in the tax rate per barrel of oil lifted and sold as a result of the 44% increase in realized oil prices in 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Total DD A expense increased due to an 11% increase in volumes during 2011 compared to 2010 combined with an increase in our ratio of costs subject to depletion over proved reserves in the fourth quarter 2011 related to our new offshore Malaysian developments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31:
912750_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The increase in gross interest expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily resulted from the September 2011 issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022, as well as the June 2012 issuance of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2024, partially offset by the redemption in April 2012 of our $325 million 6 5 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and in July 2012 of our $550 million 6 5 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016.
912750_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in gross interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 resulted from increased borrowings under our credit arrangements and the September 2011 issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022.
912750_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	See Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Interest expense associated with oil and gas properties excluded from amortization is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Capitalized interest decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011, due to a reduction in our average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization.
912750_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	As a result of the October 2012 sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets, unproved oil and gas properties that had been previously excluded from amortization were removed from such classification.
912750_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Capitalized interest increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to an increase in the average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization, primarily resulting from the acquisition of assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah.
912750_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	The fluctuations in commodity derivative income from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these periods.
912750_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were (20%), 36% and 37%, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory tax rate due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits, state income taxes and the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates.
912750_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our effective tax rate generally approximates 37%.
912750_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Our effective tax rate for 2012 was affected by our decision to repatriate international earnings, use foreign tax credits (FTCs), a valuation allowance for FTCs and the recording of a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset in Malaysia.
912750_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	Please see the discussion and tables in Note 9, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
912750_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices; the timing, amount and location of future production; operating expenses; and capital costs.
912750_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and property acquisitions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	These activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	Lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as further described below.
912750_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, which includes cash flows from operations and if applicable, non-strategic asset sales.
912750_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Approximately 84% of our expected 2013 domestic oil and gas production (excluding NGLs) supporting the current 2013 capital budget estimate is hedged.
912750_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Our 2013 capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and overhead of $182 million, is expected to be between $1.7 $1.9 billion and focuses on projects with higher return on investment, which we believe generate and lay the foundation for oil production growth in 2014 and thereafter.
912750_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	Of the total 2013 capital budget, approximately $1.4 $1.5 billion will be allocated to our domestic business.
912750_13_ITEM7_P36_S5	Substantially all of the 2013 budget is allocated to oil or liquids-rich projects.
912750_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets sold.
912750_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.
912750_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	We used a portion of the proceeds from the $1 billion Senior Notes offering combined with the proceeds from our non-strategic asset sale program to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit arrangements, as well as redeem our 6 5 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	available borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion under our credit arrangements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	In October 2012, we closed the sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W T Offshore, Inc. for approximately $208 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	We expect to substantially fund our 2013 capital program with cash flows from operations, proceeds from non-strategic asset sales during the year and available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	We believe that the Company s liquidity position and our ability to generate cash flows from our asset portfolio will be adequate to fund 2013 operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	We continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of $36 million.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	We attempt to sell these securities every 7-28 days until the auctions succeed, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S6	We currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent or that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P39_S7	See Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the auction rate securities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain a revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion that matures in June 2016, as well as money market lines of credit of $145 million, for a total borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our long-term debt includes senior and senior subordinated notes which total $3.05 billion.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	At December 31, 2012, we had no scheduled maturities of Senior Notes or Senior Subordinated Notes until 2018.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior and senior subordinated notes, please see Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	At February 20, 2013, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	We had outstanding borrowings of $65 million under our credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	Our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately $1.3 billion, and we had $2 million in other undrawn letters of credit outstanding.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S9	Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S10	These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S11	The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P40_S12	Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners.
912750_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital.
912750_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	We anticipate that our 2013 capital investment levels will exceed our estimate of cash flows from operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	We expect to sell non-strategic assets and use available capacity under our credit arrangements to fund any shortfall.
912750_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had negative working capital of $93 million and $157 million, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	The changes in our working capital are primarily a result of the timing of the collection of receivables, changes in the fair value of our derivative positions, the timing of crude oil liftings in our international operations, drilling activities, payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash flows from operations are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are primarily affected by sale of our oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital.
912750_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	We sell substantially all of our oil, gas and NGLs under floating price, market sensitive contracts.
912750_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months.
912750_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had no open derivative contracts for NGLs.
912750_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	See Oil and Gas Hedging below.
912750_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	We typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within 45-60 days of production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by DD A, ceiling test writedowns, other impairments or other non-cash charges or credits.
912750_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Our net cash flows from operations were approximately $1.1 billion in 2012 and $1.6 billion in 2011 and 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	The changes in cash flow from operations in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities coupled with a decrease in our after tax cash margin as a result of a significant increase in cash taxes in Malaysia.
912750_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	Net cash used in investing activities for 2012 was $1.2 billion compared to $2.2 billion for 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	received proceeds of $630 million from sales of oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 was $24 million compared to $684 million for 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	repurchased $11 million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	repurchased $19 million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Our capital investments of $1.9 billion for 2012 decreased 14% from our capital investments of $2.2 billion during 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	These amounts exclude negligible acquisitions during 2012 and $321 million in 2011, and recorded asset retirement obligations of $9 million and $33 million in the respective years.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	Of the total $1.9 billion invested during 2012, we invested $1.3 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $239 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $67 million in leasing domestic proved and unproved property (leasehold) and $253 million outside the United States.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	Our capital investments of $2.2 billion for 2011 increased 34% from our capital investments of $1.7 billion during 2010.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	These amounts exclude acquisitions of $321 million and $314 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and recorded asset retirement obligations of $33 million and $13 million in the respective years.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	Of the total $2.2 billion spent during 2011, we invested $1.5 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $237 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $131 million in leasing domestic proved and unproved property (leasehold) and $314 million outside the United States.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S7	We have budgeted between $1.7 $1.9 billion of planned capital investments in 2013.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S8	The planned budget excludes estimated capitalized interest and overhead of approximately $182 million, as well as any acquisitions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S9	Substantially all of the 2013 budget is allocated to oil or liquids-rich projects.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S10	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S11	In addition, at times we have increased our capital budget as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S12	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.
912750_13_ITEM7_P47_S13	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations by maturity as of December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	(1) Includes agreements for office space, platform construction, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for platform construction and drilling rigs, and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Due to our various working interests where these service contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	(2) As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	We have work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, natural gas transportation and fulfilling other related commitments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	At December 31, 2012, these work-related commitments totaled $132 million, all of which were attributable to our international business.
912750_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted.
912750_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions, we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	However, in the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $2.55 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	As of December 31, 2012, our delivery commitments through 2024 were as follows:
912750_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	(1) Our oil delivery commitments include a particular commitment with a Salt Lake City, Utah refiner.
912750_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	This delivery commitment will begin upon the refiner completing the expansion of their facility, which is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.
912750_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our delivery commitment is to deliver approximately 20,000 barrels of oil per day over a 10-year period.
912750_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	This delivery commitment represents approximately 50% of our committed oil volumes for each of the years 2015 through 2019, increases to 77% in 2020, and is 100% of our commitment through 2024.
912750_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Oil and Gas Hedging We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months.
912750_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities below and Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices in Item 7A of this report.
912750_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Please see the discussion and tables in Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Between January 1, 2013 and February 20, 2013, we entered into additional derivative contracts as set forth below.
912750_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories.
912750_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category.
912750_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method.
912750_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates:
912750_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company.
912750_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Stock-based compensation costs require estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules.
912750_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost.
912750_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment.
912750_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs.
912750_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two-step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to see if an impairment is required.
912750_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	If required, the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward looking prices.
912750_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	Impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using SEC pricing, costs in effect at year-end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals.
912750_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our exploration and development activities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized.
912750_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones.
912750_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.
912750_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties less accumulated amortization, plus an estimate of our future development costs and estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of salvage values are amortized on a unit-of-production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Amortization is calculated separately on a country-by-country basis.
912750_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on SEC pricing and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	Changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	Estimated proved oil, gas and NGL reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DD A expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S6	Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S7	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S8	To change our domestic DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 3%, or 100 Bcfe.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S9	To change our Malaysia DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in Malaysia of approximately 2%, or 2 Bcfe.
912750_13_ITEM7_P72_S10	To change our China DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in China of approximately 2%, or 3 Bcfe.
912750_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the applicable cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The ceiling value of oil, gas and NGL reserves is calculated based on SEC pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting, if any.
912750_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	At December 31, 2012, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.84 per barrel for oil.
912750_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	Using these prices, the cost center ceiling at December 31, 2012 was below the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties, resulting in a ceiling test writedown of approximately $1.5 billion.
912750_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	At December 31, 2012, the Malaysia and China cost center ceilings exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $72 million and $376 million, respectively, net of tax.
912750_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	Holding all other factors constant, it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in Malaysia and China if the applicable average oil price declined approximately 31% and 62%, respectively, from prices used at December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P77_S4	Given the fluctuation of oil, natural gas and NGL prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term.
912750_13_ITEM7_P77_S5	If commodity prices decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future.
912750_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base.
912750_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.
912750_13_ITEM7_P78_S5	In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled).
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S3	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S4	At December 31, 2012, we had a total of approximately $1.5 billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools, the majority of which related to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S5	Inclusion of some or all of our domestic unevaluated property costs in our domestic full cost pool, without adding any associated reserves, would have resulted in a larger ceiling test writedown.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S6	The same test applied to our international business units resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each of our international full cost pools.
912750_13_ITEM7_P79_S7	Holding all other factors constant, including all of our unevaluated property costs in our Malaysia and China amortization bases would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown for either full cost pool.
912750_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants.
912750_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates.
912750_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
912750_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_13_ITEM7_P82_S3	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 8%, or $318 million.
912750_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	To change our Malaysia DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in Malaysia of approximately 28%, or $10 million.
912750_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	To change our China DD A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in China of approximately 6%, or $12 million.
912750_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date.
912750_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date.
912750_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as goodwill.
912750_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.
912750_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The value allocated to recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above.
912750_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The accounting standard for business combinations establishes how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
912750_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction.
912750_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	We do not designate future price-risk management activities as accounting hedges.
912750_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had net derivative assets of $121 million, of which 50%, based on total hedged volumes, was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black-Scholes) and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative.
912750_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts.
912750_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	As a result, the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than the fair value as of December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	For equity-based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	Additionally in 2011, we granted cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	See Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	New Accounting Requirements In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities.
912750_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The guidance will require disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement.
912750_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
912750_13_ITEM7_P100_S3	We do not expect adoption of the additional disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income.
912750_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	The guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity.
912750_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	The guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity s equity.
912750_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	The guidance is retrospective and effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Adopting the disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	In May 2011, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	The most significant change required, for Level 3 fair value measurements, disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements.
912750_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_13_ITEM7_P102_S4	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Adopting the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation.
912750_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business, in Item 1A of this report.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next 24-36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	At December 31, 2012, seven of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our estimated future hedged production with no single counterparty accounting for more than 25% of that production.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest Rates We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 100% of our obligations were at fixed rates as of December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	A 10% increase in LIBOR would not impact our interest cost on debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012, but would affect the fair value of outstanding debt, as well as interest cost associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, the management of our Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newfield Exploration Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_13_ITEM8_P2_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

912750_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Organization and Principles of Consolidation We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).
912750_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	Our principal domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore Gulf Coast.
912750_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	Internationally, we focus on offshore oil developments in Malaysia and China.
912750_13_ITEM8_P9_S3	Our financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_13_ITEM8_P9_S4	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_13_ITEM8_P9_S5	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to Newfield, we, us, our or the Company are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Dependence on Commodity Prices As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves.
912750_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
912750_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Our most significant financial estimates are associated with our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and the fair value of our derivative positions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.
912750_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	These reclassifications did not impact our net income (loss), stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Substantially all of our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold to a variety of purchasers under short-term contracts (less than 12 months) and, most recently, long-term contracts in the Uinta basin, at market sensitive prices.
912750_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	Revenues from the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Under the sales method, the company and other joint owners may sell more or less than their entitled share of production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Should the company s excess sales exceed our share of estimated remaining reasonable reserves, a liability is recorded.
912750_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Differences between these sales and our entitled share of production are not significant.
912750_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	Other on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	Investments Investments consist primarily of debt and equity securities, as well as auction rate securities, a majority of which are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value.
912750_13_ITEM8_P19_S3	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
912750_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	We realized interest income and net gains on our investment securities in 2012, 2011 and 2010 of $3 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.
912750_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	Generally, our oil and gas receivables are collected within 45 to 60 days of production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated.
912750_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our offshore operations in Malaysia and China.
912750_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	At December 31, 2012, we wrote down subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	The writedown of $8 million is included in Operating expenses Other on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in Malaysia and China is produced into floating production, storage and off-loading vessels (FPSOs) or onshore storage terminals and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	The product inventory consisted of approximately 744,000 barrels and 239,000 barrels of crude oil valued at cost of $64 million and $19 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P26_S2	Cost for purposes of the carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of production costs and depletion expense.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Oil and Gas Properties We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	We capitalized $123 million, $113 million and $79 million of internal costs in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	Interest expense related to unproved properties is also capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S4	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S5	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S6	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_13_ITEM8_P27_S7	A particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	The risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, increases when oil, gas and NGL prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S3	At December 31, 2012, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.84 per barrel for oil.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S4	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.5 billion ($948 million, after-tax).
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S5	The ceiling with respect to our properties in Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of properties, requiring no writedown at December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S6	The continued decline of SEC pricing of oil and natural gas since December 31, 2012 may result in additional ceiling test writedowns in the first quarter of 2013 and possibly thereafter.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S7	At December 31, 2011, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.13 per barrel for oil.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S8	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the U.S., Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P28_S9	As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2011.
912750_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	At December 31, 2010, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas and $79.42 per barrel for oil.
912750_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the U.S., Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2010.
912750_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	See Note 3, Oil and Gas Assets, for a detailed discussion regarding our acquisition and sales transactions during 2012, 2011 and 2010.
912750_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Other Property and Equipment Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the ARO is incurred.
912750_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Settlements include payments made to satisfy the AROs, as well as transfer of the ARO to purchasers of our divested properties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will equal the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming the normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for our Company.
912750_13_ITEM8_P32_S3	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the original capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_13_ITEM8_P32_S4	Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P32_S5	The change in our ARO for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	(1) For the year ended December 31, 2012, settlements include $28 million related to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	See Note 3, Oil and Gas Assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, liabilities and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
912750_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	We accrue for losses when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
912750_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for a more detailed discussion regarding our contingencies.
912750_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Environmental Matters Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed as incurred.
912750_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based upon evaluations of currently available facts related to each site.
912750_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Income Taxes We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions and as such we had not accrued related interest or penalties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	The tax years 2009-2012 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	For equity-based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Additionally in 2011, we granted cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	See Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	Our joint interest partners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers.
912750_13_ITEM8_P40_S3	If the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general was adversely affected, the ability of our joint interest partners to reimburse us could be adversely affected.
912750_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	The purchasers of our oil, gas and NGL production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Historically, we have sold our oil, gas and NGLs to several purchasers.
912750_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The use of hedging transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	The counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	We monitor the credit ratings of our hedging counterparties on an ongoing basis.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	At December 31, 2012, seven of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our estimated future hedged production, with no single counterparty accounting for more than 25% of that production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	Major Customers Royal Dutch Shell plc, Tesoro Corporation and Big West Oil LLC accounted for 14%, 14% and 10% respectively, of our consolidated revenues in 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S4	During 2011, sales of our oil and gas production to Royal Dutch Shell plc and Tesoro Corporation accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S5	No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales of oil and gas production during 2010.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S6	We believe that the loss of Royal Dutch Shell plc would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are readily available.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S7	An extended loss of Tesoro Corporation, Big West Oil LLC, or any of our other large purchasers of our Monument Butte field oil production could have a material adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of the black and yellow wax crude oil, which we produce from this field.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S8	Due to the higher paraffin content of this production, it must remain heated during shipping so it cannot be transported in conventional pipelines, and there is limited refining capacity for it in the vicinity of our production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S9	In poor economic environments and tight financial markets, there is an increased risk that the current purchasers of our production may fail to satisfy their obligations to us under our crude oil purchase contracts.
912750_13_ITEM8_P44_S10	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to sell to these purchasers or that similar substitute arrangements could be made for sales of our black and yellow wax crude oil with other purchasers if desired.
912750_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We account for our derivative activities by applying authoritative accounting and reporting guidance, which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
912750_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	All of the derivative instruments that we utilize are to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	We have elected not to designate price-risk management activities as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance and, accordingly, account for them using the mark-to-market accounting method.
912750_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Under this method, the changes in contract values are reported currently in earnings.
912750_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	We periodically utilize derivatives to manage our exposure to variable interest rates.
912750_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as well as unrealized gains and losses on investments and changes in post-retirement benefits, all recorded net of tax.
912750_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	As of December 31, 2012, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of a $6 million unrealized loss on investments and a $1 million unrealized loss on post-retirement benefits.
912750_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	As of December 31, 2011, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of an $8 million unrealized loss on investments and a $2 million unrealized loss on post-retirement benefits.
912750_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The guidance will require disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement.
912750_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
912750_13_ITEM8_P49_S3	We do not expect adoption of the additional disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income.
912750_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	The guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity.
912750_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	The guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity s equity.
912750_13_ITEM8_P50_S3	The guidance is retrospective and effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_13_ITEM8_P50_S4	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Adopting the reporting requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	In May 2011, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	The most significant change required, for Level 3 fair value measurements, disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011.
912750_13_ITEM8_P51_S4	We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Adopting the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (excluding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Diluted earnings per share incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_13_ITEM8_P53_S3	Please see Note 10, Stock-Based Compensation.
912750_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for the indicated years:
912750_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	(1) The effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding has not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2012 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	Had we recognized net income for that year, incremental shares attributable to the assumed exercise of outstanding options and the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units would have increased diluted weighted-average shares outstanding by 0.7 million shares for the year.
912750_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	(2) The calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 excludes the effect of 1.4 million and 0.7 million, respectively, unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units and stock options because including the effect would be anti-dilutive.
912750_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Oil and Gas Assets: Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31: Oil and gas properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which we own an interest.
912750_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	These unproved property costs include unevaluated leasehold acreage, geological and geophysical data costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, costs associated with wells in progress at December 31 and capitalized interest.
912750_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	We exclude these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired.
912750_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Unproved property costs are grouped by major prospect area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant.
912750_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Costs associated with wells in progress are transferred to the amortization base upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results.
912750_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	All other costs excluded from the amortization base are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred.
912750_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	The amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for international operations if a reserve base has not yet been established.
912750_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The following is a summary of our oil and gas properties not subject to amortization as of December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	We believe that our evaluation activities related to substantially all of our conventional properties not subject to amortization will be completed within four years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	Because of the size of our unconventional resource plays, the entire evaluation will take significantly longer than four years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	At December 31, 2012, approximately 85% of oil and gas properties not subject to amortization were associated with our unconventional resource plays.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Gulf of Mexico Asset Sale On October 5, 2012, we closed on the sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W T Offshore, Inc. for approximately $208 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	The sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of sale.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S3	In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million (includes $4 million in purchase price adjustments).
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S4	The assets include approximately 65,000 net acres, which are largely undeveloped and located north of our Greater Monument Butte Unit.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S5	In February 2010, we acquired certain of TXCO Resources Inc. s assets in the Maverick basin of southwest Texas for approximately $205 million.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S6	In the acquisition, we obtained an interest in approximately 300,000 net acres, primarily in the Pearsall and Eagle Ford shale plays, as well as production of 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S7	Our consolidated financial statements include the cash flows and results of operations for these assets subsequent to the acquisition date.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S8	Other Asset Acquisitions and Sales During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $9 million, $1 million and $108 million, respectively, and sold various other non-strategic oil and gas properties for proceeds of approximately $630 million (includes Gulf of Mexico asset sale discussed above), $406 million and $12 million, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S9	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_13_ITEM8_P61_S10	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	We utilize fixed price swaps, purchased put options (floors), collars (combination of purchased put options and sold call options (ceiling)) and three-way collars (combination of a collar and the sale of additional put options with a strike price below the floor of the collar) to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable price movements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	With respect to a swap contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	For a floor contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	We are not required to make any payment in connection with the settlement of a floor contract.
912750_13_ITEM8_P63_S3	For a collar contract, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price while we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P63_S4	Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor price and equal to or less than the ceiling price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	A three-way collar contract consists of a standard collar contract plus a put sold by us with a price below the floor price of the collar.
912750_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	This additional put requires us to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the put price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	Combining the collar contract with the additional put results in us being entitled to a net payment equal to the difference between the floor price of the standard collar and the additional put price if the settlement price is equal to or less than the additional put price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P64_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar contract only.
912750_13_ITEM8_P64_S4	This strategy enables us to increase the floor and the ceiling price of the collar beyond the range of a traditional no cost collar while defraying the associated cost with the sale of the additional put.
912750_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	All of our derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Substantially all of our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility and, in the case of collars and floors, the remaining term of options.
912750_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_13_ITEM8_P65_S4	Please see Note 7, Fair Value Measurements.
912750_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	We recognize all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts on a mark-to-market basis in our consolidated statement of operations under the caption Commodity derivative income.
912750_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating cash flows on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
912750_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had outstanding contracts with respect to our future production that were not designated for hedge accounting as set forth in the tables below.
912750_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	During the first quarter of 2012, natural gas spot market prices were below the puts we sold on our three-way collars for April through December 2012 and the full-year 2013, exposing us further to the softening natural gas spot market.
912750_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	As a result, during the first quarter of 2012 we entered into additional fixed-price swap contracts in the over-the-counter market that effectively prevented any further erosion in the value of our natural gas three-way collars.
912750_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	The new swap contracts added during the first quarter of 2012 were for the same volumes as our full-year 2013 three-way collar contracts.
912750_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	The economics from the combination of these additional fixed-price swap contracts and our natural gas three-way collar contracts will result in effective average fixed prices of $4.96, $4.82.
912750_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	$4.82 and $4.86 per MMBtu for the first, second, third and fourth quarter of 2013, respectively, as long as natural gas spot prices for the respective time periods settle below the puts we sold on our three-way collar contracts.
912750_13_ITEM8_P68_S5	In the event natural gas spot prices settle above the ceilings on our associated three-way collar volumes, we would not recover the difference through the sale of our production as we would realize losses on both instruments discussed above.
912750_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Interest Rate Swap We previously hedged $50 million principal amount of our $175 million 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 through an interest rate swap.
912750_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The swap provided for us to pay variable and receive fixed payments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	During the first half of 2010, we repurchased our outstanding 7 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2011 and received approximately $2 million upon the termination and settlement of the swap.
912750_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below at December 31:
912750_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in Commodity derivative income in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments was as follows at December 31:
912750_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	The total realized gain on commodity derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2010 differs from the net cash receipts on derivative settlements due to the recognition of option premiums associated with derivatives settled during the respective period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative instruments with that counterparty.
912750_13_ITEM8_P72_S2	At December 31, 2012, seven of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our estimated future hedged production, with no single counterparty accounting for more than 25% of that production.
912750_13_ITEM8_P72_S3	A significant portion of our derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM8_P72_S4	Our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	6. Accrued Liabilities: Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Fair Value Measurements: Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_13_ITEM8_P77_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps and certain investments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	Our valuation methodology for investments is a discounted cash flow model that considers various inputs including: (a) the coupon rate specified under the debt instruments, (b) the current credit ratings of the underlying issuers, (c) collateral characteristics and (d) risk-adjusted discount rates.
912750_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as commodity options including, price collars, floors and three-way collars and other financial investments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	Although we utilize third-party broker quotes to assess the reasonableness of our prices and valuation techniques for derivative instruments, we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2.
912750_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
912750_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of our financial assets (liabilities) by measurement levels:
912750_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	The determination of the fair values above incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), if any.
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we held $36 million of auction rate securities maturing beginning in 2033 that are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	This amount reflects a decrease in the fair value of these investments since the time of purchase of $9 million ($6 million net of tax) recorded under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we held $32 million of auction rate securities, which reflected a decrease in the fair value of $13 million ($8 million net of tax).
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S4	The debt instruments underlying our auction rate securities are mostly investment grade (rated BBB or better) and are guaranteed by the United States government or backed by private loan collateral.
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S5	We do not believe the decrease in the fair value of these securities is permanent because we currently intend to hold these investments until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.
912750_13_ITEM8_P85_S6	Our current available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements provides us the liquidity to continue to hold these securities.
912750_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods: Qualitative Disclosures about Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Commodity Derivatives.
912750_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various factors, including certain significant unobservable inputs such as (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) volatility factors and (c) counterparty credit risk.
912750_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts.
912750_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Significant increases (decreases) in the quoted forward prices for commodities generally leads to corresponding decreases (increases) in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	Significant changes in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors that include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	Historically, we have not experienced significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	We utilize a discounted cash flow model in the determination of the valuation of our auction rate securities classified as Level 3.
912750_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	This model considers various inputs including (a) the coupon rate specified under the debt instrument, (b) the current credit rating of the underlying issuers, (c) collateral characteristics and (d) risk-adjusted discount rates.
912750_13_ITEM8_P92_S2	The most significant unobservable factor in the determination of the investments fair value, however, is market liquidity for these instruments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P92_S3	A significant change in the liquidity of the market for auction rate securities would lead to a corresponding change in the fair value measurement of these investments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	The underlying inputs in the determination of the valuation of our auction rate securities are developed by a third party and, therefore, not included in the quantitative analysis above.
912750_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as of December 31, was as follows:
912750_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	Any amounts outstanding under our credit arrangements at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	At December 31, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	(1) Because capacity under our credit facility was available to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations, if any, are classified as long-term.
912750_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	We have a revolving credit facility that matures in June 2016.
912750_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	The terms of the credit facility provide for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of 13 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent.
912750_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	In September 2011, we entered into the first amendment to the credit facility, which allows us to issue senior notes or other debt instruments that are secured equally and ratably with the credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 13% of total commitments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (75 basis points per annum at December 31, 2012) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (175 basis points per annum at December 31, 2012).
912750_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating (30 basis points per annum at December 31, 2012).
912750_13_ITEM8_P100_S2	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our current and previous credit facilities of approximately $3 million, $2 million and $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which are recorded in Interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns and goodwill impairments) to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating (175 basis points at December 31, 2012).

912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S3	Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, at December 31, 2012, we also had a total of $145 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S4	The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; a change of control; or certain other material adverse changes in our business.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S5	Our senior notes and senior subordinated notes also contain standard events of default.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S6	If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S7	In addition, our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S8	Senior Notes In September 2011, we issued $750 million of 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022 and received proceeds of $742 million (net of discount and offering costs).
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S9	These notes were issued at 99.956% of par to yield 5 3 / 4 %.

912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S14	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S15	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S16	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_13_ITEM8_P102_S17	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:
912750_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_13_ITEM8_P103_S2	At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Other on our consolidated statement of operations.

912750_13_ITEM8_P106_S2	We may redeem some or all of our 7 1 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 at any time on or after May 15, 2013 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_13_ITEM8_P106_S3	Prior to May 15, 2013, we may redeem all, but not part, of these notes at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_13_ITEM8_P106_S4	We may redeem some or all of our 6 7 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.

912750_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	For the years ended December 31, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	For the years ended December 31, the total provision for income taxes consisted of the following: The provision for income taxes for each of the indicated years was different than the amount computed using the federal statutory rate (35%) for the following reasons:
912750_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	At December 31, the components of our deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability were as follows:
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	We evaluate our cash flows and capital projects for domestic and international operations annually.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	Our foreign operations generated excess cash flow for the first time in 2012, and we estimate them to be cash flow neutral or generating excess cash flow in future years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	In the fourth quarter 2012, we restructured our foreign operations as a result of deciding to invest excess international cash into our domestic operations for the next few years, and consequently, the permanent international reinvestment tax assertion is no longer applicable.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S3	As a result, we recorded $521 million of U.S. deferred taxes for our inception-to-December 31, 2012 foreign earnings, which had not been recorded previously and will record U.S. taxes on future international earnings annually.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S4	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion for federal income tax and $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion for state income tax purposes, respectively, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S5	NOL carryforwards of $223 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S6	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $126 million of our various gross state NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S7	To the extent not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2031.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S8	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had gross NOL carryforwards for international income tax purposes of approximately $17 million and $48 million, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we utilized international NOLs of $31 million, which were generated in 2011.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S10	In addition, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $17 million of international NOLs, which we currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P111_S11	As a result, valuation allowances were established for these items in 2005 and 2006.
912750_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing deferred tax assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P113_S2	The rollforward of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows at December 31:
912750_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a $25 million valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset in Malaysia due to insufficient estimated future taxable income.
912750_13_ITEM8_P114_S1	Also in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a valuation allowance related to insufficient estimated future domestic taxable income to fully utilize foreign tax credits of $421 million, in conjunction with our decision to repatriate international earnings.
912750_13_ITEM8_P114_S2	The foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is fully offset by a valuation allowance.
912750_13_ITEM8_P114_S3	In 2011, we recorded a $5 million valuation allowance related to various NOLs, which were generated in certain of the states where we conduct operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	Stock-Based Compensation: All stock-based compensation equity awards to employees and non-employee directors are currently granted under the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan (our 2011 Plan).
912750_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_13_ITEM8_P115_S2	In February 2011, we also granted cash-settled restricted stock units to employees.
912750_13_ITEM8_P115_S3	These awards were not issued under any of our plans as they will be settled in cash upon vesting and are accounted for as liability awards.
912750_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	We issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_13_ITEM8_P116_S1	We primarily utilize treasury shares when restricted stock is issued or restricted stock units vest.
912750_13_ITEM8_P116_S2	Shares available for grant under our 2011 Plan are reduced by 1.87 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_13_ITEM8_P116_S3	At December 31, 2012, we had approximately (1) 3.3 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing plan if all future awards under our 2011 Plan are stock options, or (2) 1.8 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing plan if all future awards under our 2011 Plan are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_13_ITEM8_P116_S4	Thus far, the majority of the awards under our 2011 Plan have been granted as restricted stock unit awards.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Our stock-based compensation consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: The excess tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital and is calculated as the amount by which the tax deduction we receive exceeds the deferred tax asset associated with recorded stock-based compensation expense.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S1	We did not realize an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation for 2012, 2011 or 2010 because we did not have sufficient taxable income to fully realize the deduction.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S2	At December 31, 2012, we had unrecognized net operating losses of $118 million related to stock-based compensation.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $83 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S4	This compensation expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting periods.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S5	The full amount is expected to be recognized within five years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S6	We have granted stock options under several plans.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S7	Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_13_ITEM8_P117_S8	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
912750_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	The table below provides information about stock option activity for the following years:
912750_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	(1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of our common stock at the indicated date, or at the time of exercise, exceeds the exercise price of the option.
912750_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	On December 31, 2012, the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $26.78 per share.
912750_13_ITEM8_P120_S1	The table below summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2012: Restricted Stock.
912750_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	At December 31, 2012, our employees held an aggregate of 2.4 million shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that primarily vest over a service period of three to five years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P121_S1	The vesting of these shares and units is dependent upon the employee s continued service with our Company.
912750_13_ITEM8_P121_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2012, our employees held 0.4 million shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting criteria (substantially all of which are considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	The table below provides information about restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the following years: The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $44 million, $32 million and $39 million, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P122_S1	During the first quarter of 2011, we granted cash-settled restricted stock units to employees that vest over three years.
912750_13_ITEM8_P122_S2	The value of the awards, and the associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company s stock price.
912750_13_ITEM8_P122_S3	In February 2012, the first tranche of the 2011 grants vested, which required settlement of approximately 44,000 cash-settled restricted units for approximately $1.7 million.
912750_13_ITEM8_P122_S4	As of December 31, 2012, 77,564 cash-settled restricted stock units were outstanding.
912750_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	Pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, for each six-month period beginning on January 1 or July 1 during the term of the plan, each eligible employee has the opportunity to purchase our common stock for a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the period or the last day of the period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	No employee may purchase common stock under the plan valued at more than $25,000 in any calendar year.
912750_13_ITEM8_P123_S2	Employees of our foreign subsidiaries are not eligible to participate in the plan.
912750_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	At our May 7, 2010 annual meeting, our stockholders approved the Newfield Exploration Company 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
912750_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	This plan replaced our 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was terminated on June 30, 2010.
912750_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	This plan became effective July 1, 2010 with one million shares of our common stock available for issuance.
912750_13_ITEM8_P124_S3	During 2012, options to purchase approximately 165,722 shares of our common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plan.
912750_13_ITEM8_P124_S4	The weighted-average fair value of each option was $9.86 per share.
912750_13_ITEM8_P124_S5	The fair value of the options granted was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends, a risk-free weighted-average interest rate of 0.10%, an expected life of six months and weighted-average volatility of 49.43%.
912750_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	At December 31, 2012, 703,033 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the current plan.

912750_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	Under the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Management Development Committee determines the annual award pool for all employees based upon a number of factors including the Company s performance against stated performance goals and in comparison with peer companies in our industry.
912750_13_ITEM8_P129_S1	All employees are eligible if employed on October 1 and December 31 of the performance period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P129_S2	Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2010, our annual cash incentive compensation is paid in a single payment to employees during the first quarter after the end of the performance period.

912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	401(k) and Deferred Compensation Plans We sponsor a 401(k) profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	This plan covers all of our employees, excluding those of our foreign subsidiaries.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S2	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the IRS.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S3	We also sponsor a highly compensated employee deferred compensation plan.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S4	This non-qualified plan allows an eligible employee to defer a portion of his or her salary or bonus on an annual basis.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S5	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the plan.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S6	Our contribution with respect to each participant in the deferred compensation plan is reduced by the amount of contribution made by us to our 401(k) plan for that participant.
912750_13_ITEM8_P130_S7	Our combined contributions to these two plans for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $10 million, $8 million and $6 million, respectively.

912750_13_ITEM8_P132_S3	We have work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, transportation of our production and fulfilling other related commitments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P132_S4	At December 31, 2012, these work-related commitments totaled $132 million, all of which were attributable to our international businesses.
912750_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	As of December 31, 2012, our delivery commitments through 2024 were as follows:
912750_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	(1) Our oil delivery commitments include a particular commitment with a Salt Lake City, Utah refiner.
912750_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	This delivery commitment will begin upon the refiner completing the expansion of their facility, which is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.
912750_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	Our delivery commitment is to deliver approximately 20,000 barrels of oil per day over a 10-year period.
912750_13_ITEM8_P134_S3	This delivery commitment represents approximately 50% of our committed oil volumes for each of the years 2015 through 2019, increases to 77% in 2020, and is 100% of our commitment through 2024.
912750_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	Given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions, we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	However, in the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $2.55 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	Other on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	Segment Information: While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are organizationally structured along geographic operating segments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	Our current operating segments are the United States, Malaysia, China and Other International.
912750_13_ITEM8_P137_S2	The accounting policies of each of our operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
912750_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
912750_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	Income tax allocations have been determined based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment.
912750_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	The following table presents information about supplemental cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31:
912750_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	Related Party Transaction: Kevin M. Robinson, our Vice President Asia, and Susan G. Riggs, our Treasurer, are minority owners of Huffco International L.L.C. (Huffco).
912750_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	In May 1997, before Mr. Robinson and Ms. Riggs joined us, we acquired from Huffco an entity now known as Newfield China, LDC, the owner of a 12% interest in a three field unit located on Blocks 04/36 and 05/36 in Bohai Bay, offshore China.
912750_13_ITEM8_P141_S1	Huffco retained preferred shares of Newfield China that provide for an aggregate dividend equal to 10% of the excess of proceeds received by Newfield China from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals over all costs incurred with respect to exploration and production in Block 05/36, plus the cash purchase price we paid Huffco for Newfield China ($6 million).
912750_13_ITEM8_P141_S2	During 2012, 2011 and 2010, Newfield China paid $7 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively, of dividends to Huffco on the preferred shares of Newfield China.
912750_13_ITEM8_P141_S3	Based on our estimate of the net present value of the proved reserves associated with Block 05/36, the indirect interest (through Huffco) in Newfield China s preferred shares held by Mr. Robinson and Ms. Riggs had a net present value of approximately $94,000 and $235,000, respectively at December 31, 2012.
912750_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited): The results of operations by quarter for the indicated periods are as follows:
912750_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	(1) The sum of the individual quarterly earnings (loss) per share may not agree with year-to-date earnings (loss) per share as each quarterly computation is based on the income or loss for that quarter and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter.
912750_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	(2) Income (loss) from operations for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes a full cost ceiling test writedown of $1.5 billion.

912750_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	Reserves Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P149_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_13_ITEM8_P150_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into our reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.
912750_13_ITEM8_P150_S2	The technical employee responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, with more than 30 years of experience (including 20 years of experience in reserve estimation).

912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	The following is a discussion of our proved reserves and reserve additions and revisions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S2	Our proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2012 were 1.8 Tcf compared to 2.3 Tcf and 2.5 Tcf at year-end 2011 and 2010, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S3	Our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year-end 2012 were 237 MMBbls compared to 247 MMBbls and 198 MMBbls at year-end 2011 and 2010, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S4	Our proved NGL reserves at year-end 2012 were 37 MMBbls compared to 16 MMBbls and 6 MMBbls at year-end 2011 and 2010, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S5	Oil, condensate and NGLs comprised about 48%, 40% and 33% of our proved reserves at year-end 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S6	During 2012, our proved reserves decreased 30 Bcfe as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases of reserves in place) being more than offset by revisions of previous estimates, mostly due to price as described below.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S7	We expect the majority of future reserve growth to be associated with infill drilling, extensions of current fields and new discoveries, as well as improved recovery operations and purchases of proved properties.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S8	The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S9	We added 512 Bcfe of proved reserves through discoveries, extensions and other additions, and 4 Bcfe through purchases.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S10	Drilling additions related to our resource plays in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains and South Texas constituted 92% of our additions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S11	Of the drilling additions, 362 Bcfe or 60 MMBOE were proved undeveloped additions and 13 MMBOE were proved developed oil and NGL reserves.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S12	We added 909 Bcfe of proved reserves during 2011.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S13	Approximately 857 Bcfe of the additions resulted from discoveries, extensions and other additions, and 52 Bcfe related to purchases.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S14	Drilling additions related primarily to activities in our resource plays in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S15	Of the drilling additions, 430 Bcfe or 72 MMBOE were proved undeveloped additions in the Rocky Mountains, associated primarily with the Williston basin and the Greater Monument Butte Unit.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S16	In addition, 16 MMBbls of proved developed oil reserves were added during 2011.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S17	While total proved reserve revisions in 2012 were a negative 546 Bcfe or 14% of the beginning of year proved reserves, they included a negative price revision of 616 Bcfe primarily related to our onshore natural gas plays.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S18	The largest area affected by lower natural gas prices was the Woodford Shale.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S19	Price revisions there were primarily to proved undeveloped reserves.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S20	In mature plays, dominated by infill drilling and where reserve growth cannot be classified as an extension or discovery, the change in reserves is captured as a revision.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S21	In 2012, our revisions associated with the development of existing fields were a positive 70 Bcfe.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S22	Our total proved reserve revisions in 2011 were 288 Bcfe.
912750_13_ITEM8_P151_S23	Price-related and other revisions were negligible.
912750_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	higher margin oil drilling and the locations associated with these reserves moved outside of a five-year development horizon.
912750_13_ITEM8_P152_S1	Negative performance revisions in 2011 were 198 Bcfe, which included (i) well performance as efforts to extend the Green River section northwest of the Greater Monument Butte Unit encountered higher than expected natural gas production, (ii) the timing of waterflood response recognition in the Greater Monument Butte Unit, (iii) wellbore failures in gas reservoirs along the Gulf Coast and (iv) offset well interference in older vertical natural gas wells in the Mid-Continent region, which were adversely impacted by new horizontal well completions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P152_S2	In 2012, we sold 180 Bcfe of proved reserves associated with non-strategic assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P152_S3	In 2011, we sold 122 Bcfe of proved reserves associated with non-strategic assets.
912750_13_ITEM8_P152_S4	In 2010, sales of reserves were negligible.
912750_13_ITEM8_P152_S5	The following table sets forth our total net proved reserves and our total net proved developed and undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the changes in our total net proved reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012:

912750_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	In reviewing the information that follows, we believe that the following factors should be taken into account:
912750_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	future net revenues may be subject to different income tax rates.
912750_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	Under the standardized measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying the prices used in estimating our proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves.
912750_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	Future cash inflows do not reflect the impact of open hedge positions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P159_S1	See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments.
912750_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on year-end costs in order to arrive at net cash flows before tax.
912750_13_ITEM8_P160_S1	Future income tax expense has been computed by applying year-end statutory tax rates to aggregate future pre-tax net cash flows reduced by the tax basis of the properties involved and tax carryforwards.
912750_13_ITEM8_P160_S2	The standardized measure is derived from using a discount rate of 10% a year to reflect the timing of future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	In general, management does not rely on the following information in making investment and operating decisions.
912750_13_ITEM8_P161_S1	Such decisions are based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of probable as well as proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of possible outcomes.

912750_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	In connection with the accompanying annual report on Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the Report ), I, Terry W.

912750_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	the Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and 2.
912750_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are many factors that may affect Newfield s business and results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Described below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should carefully consider, in addition to the other information contained in this report, the risks described below.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Oil, gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth, as well as liquidity and ability to access additional sources of capital, depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, gas and NGLs.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Lower prices may reduce the amount of oil, gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Oil, gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The markets for oil, gas and NGLs have historically been, and will likely remain, volatile.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulation.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Significant declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt; causing us to delay or postpone capital projects; reducing reserves and the amount of products we can economically produce; reducing revenues, income and cash flows; or reducing the carrying value of our assets.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that we expect to be greater than cash flows from operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We anticipate that our 2014 capital investment levels will exceed our estimate of cash flows from operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	under our credit arrangements and sell non-strategic assets to fund the shortfall.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our ability to generate operating cash flows is subject to many risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas and oil, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected, if:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	we are unable to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital; one or more of the lenders under our existing credit arrangements fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us; the amount that we are allowed to borrow under our existing credit facility is reduced; or our customers or working interest owners default on their obligations to us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Actual quantities of oil, gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Estimating accumulations of oil, gas and NGLs is complex.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the effect of government regulation, taxes and availability of funds.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on our prepared estimates.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Actual quantities of oil, gas and NGL reserves, future production, oil, gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities and prevailing oil, gas and NGL prices.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on SEC 12-month pricing, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year-end discounted at 10%.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent on our success in efficiently finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	This is called a ceiling test writedown.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We evaluate the ceiling test quarterly and recorded a ceiling test writedown of approximately $1.5 billion ($948 million after-tax) at December 31, 2012.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We did not have a ceiling test writedown in 2013.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Although a ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flows from operations, it does reduce our stockholders equity and could negatively impact certain debt covenants.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may experience further ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in the future.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The risk that we will be required to further writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Drilling is a high-risk activity .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	availability, costs and terms of contractual arrangements, such as leases, pipelines and related facilities to gather, process and compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; and compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of: injury or loss of life; severe damage or destruction of property and equipment, and oil and gas reservoirs; pollution and other environmental damage; investigatory and clean-up responsibilities; regulatory investigation and penalties or lawsuits; limitation on or suspension of our operations; and repairs to resume operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Further, offshore and deepwater operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoon or other adverse weather conditions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our international operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and in turn, our results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In connection with our operations, we generally require our contractors, which include the contractor, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliate companies, its subcontractors, their agents, employees, directors and officers, to agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees, contractors and subcontractors and any property damage suffered by the contractors.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	While we maintain insurance against some potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The occurrence of any of the foregoing events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage or not indemnified, could reduce revenue and the funds available to us for our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	See also We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulation.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Matters subject to regulation include the following, in addition to the other matters discussed under the caption Regulation in Items 1 and 2 of this report:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	unitization and pooling of properties; calculating royalties on oil and gas produced under federal and state leases; and taxation.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource risk mitigation, damages and other environmental damages.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures, engage in environmental risk management and hedging activities or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Further, changes to existing environmental regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us, the oil and gas industry generally, our suppliers or our customers.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	For example, governments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change in some manner.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In the absence of dedicated federal legislation on climate change mitigation or adaptation, the EPA has promulgated several rulemakings to regulate, measure or monitor GHG emissions under the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, or CAA.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, as well as from certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities on an annual basis.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The new regulations could impact certain facilities in which we have interests (legal, equitable, operated or non-operated) by increasing regulatory risks and reporting requirements.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the CAA concluding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere from motor vehicles threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The finding, once made, required the EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions from new cars and light trucks under the CAA.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Indirectly, the EPA argued that it also triggered an EPA obligation to regulate GHG emissions under existing relevant air permitting programs for large stationary sources.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	On January 2, 2011, the EPA initiated Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting requirements for carbon dioxide and other GHGs from large and modified stationary sources.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Permits limiting GHGs have been issued for a variety of new or modified facilities under the Clean Air Act PSD program.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	GHG emissions also trigger Title V operating permit requirements for new and existing sources that exceed certain established emission thresholds.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	The PSD permitting requirement is triggered when a new or modified facility emits specified levels of GHGs (e.g., 75,000-100,000 tons per year).
912750_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Emission levels in excess of these thresholds can then trigger preconstruction permit requirements and application of best available control technology (BACT) as determined on a source-by-source basis.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In most cases, based on cost, the BACT compliance option selected for GHGs is increased energy efficiency.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If the U.S. Congress adopts market-based tax, energy or other mechanisms to regulate the carbon intensity of natural resources, or promote or require the reduction of GHG emissions from certain industrial sectors, such legislation, depending on design and scope, could increase the cost of oil and gas production and market demand.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Some states, like California, have implemented state-wide GHG mitigation programs to reduce GHG emissions through a mixture of regulatory programs, including a low carbon fuel standard and cap-and-trade market applicable to, among others, electric utilities and transportation fuels.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Further, the U.S. Congress has previously proposed legislation that would directly impact our industry.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In response to the 2010 Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Congress was considering a number of legislative proposals relating to the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and offshore that could result in significant additional laws or regulations governing our operations in the United States, including a proposal to raise or eliminate the cap on liability for oil spill cleanups under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	These and other potential regulations, if introduced and passed in Congress, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	See also The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other hydrocarbon products that we produce.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the RCT and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process, and the RCT adopted rules regarding the same in December 2011.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	On September 11, 2012, the RCT approved new regulations relating to the commercial recycling of produced water and/or hydraulic-fracturing flowback fluid, and on December 17, 2012, proposed revised amendments to rules of casing, cementing, well control and completion of oil and gas wells.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In the past three years, news reports indicate that around two dozen states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In the event state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Notwithstanding state regulatory requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing, there are steps by federal governmental agencies that are either underway or are being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and recently released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Further, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In addition, in May 2013, the BLM issued a proposed rule that would require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, set requirements for well-bore integrity and establish flowback water standards for all hydraulic fracturing operations on federal public lands and American Indian Tribal lands.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S5	The proposed rule also required that an operator certify, in writing, that (a) the stimulation design complies with all federal, state, tribal and local regulations; (b) the stimulation was completed in accordance with the design approved by BLM and all applicable regulations; and (c) the well-bore integrity was maintained during the fracturing process and flowback water was properly stored, treated and disposed.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S7	The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with draft results to be issued in 2014 for public comment and peer review.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has conducted an investigation into practices to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In a November 18, 2011 report, the Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board issued 20 recommendations to federal agencies, states and private entities that are intended to reduce the environmental impact and assure the safety of shale gas production.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Given the heightened awareness regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing, it is possible that regulatory agencies or private parties may suggest that hydraulic fracturing has caused groundwater contamination, whether or not such allegations are accurate.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	For example, on December 8, 2011, the EPA released a preliminary report indicating that hydraulic fracturing is responsible for groundwater contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, although the EPA s draft report has been hotly criticized as ignoring certain facts and utilizing incorrect data.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, the EPA has alleged in an enforcement action against an operator in Texas that the operator contaminated local groundwater wells, although the RTC found after an evidentiary hearing that the operator was not responsible for the contamination.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	However, in 2013 the EPA deferred the Pavillion matter to state oversight and withdrew the emergency action order in Texas.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	production, remains an EPA enforcement initiative.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Thus, regulatory agencies or private parties alleging groundwater contamination linked to hydraulic fracturing could trigger defense costs in administrative or civil litigation to rebut the allegations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Additionally, certain members of the Congress have called upon (a) the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, (b) the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and (c) the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	These on-going or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Further, on August 16, 2012, the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Specifically, the EPA finalized rules under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The EPA regulations include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically-fractured gas wells.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Before January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion either by flaring using a completion combustion device or by capturing the gas using green completions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P56_S4	After January 1, 2015, operators must capture the gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Further, the regulations under NESHAPS include specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We are currently evaluating the effect these regulations could have on our business.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Compliance with such regulations could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic-fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic-fracturing techniques.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P59_S4	We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P59_S5	In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S4	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the relevant underlying commodity reference prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S5	While the use of hedging arrangements may limit the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P60_S6	Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the hedged volume or there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge transactions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to perform their financial and other obligations under such transactions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	an economic loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Reform Act) was enacted to establish federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and over entities, such as Newfield, that participate in that market.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The Dodd-Frank Reform Act includes provisions that require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has begun to formally determine the types of swaps that will be subject to the mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end-users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	If our swap activities are not exempt from mandatory clearing or exchange trading, or from margin requirements for uncleared swaps, we could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for those activities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	There are substantial costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Reform Act that create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risks, including market price fluctuations associated with anticipated production of oil and gas.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules and regulations promulgated by CFTC could potentially increase the cost of Newfield s swap contracts (including through requirements to post margin or collateral for cleared and uncleared swaps), which could adversely affect our available liquidity, materially alter the terms of our swap contracts, reduce the availability of swaps to hedge or mitigate risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing swap contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, including by becoming more volatile and less predictable, which also could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P65_S3	It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In December 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Reform Act to expand aggregate position limits to include swaps that are economically equivalent to certain types of commodity futures, including specified energy commodity futures and related transactions, which could apply to swap transactions in which we engage beyond certain thresholds.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from those limits, and the rules could require additional oversight monitoring and reporting.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	If the position limit regulations are ultimately adopted substantially in the form proposed, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Leases on oil and gas properties normally have a term of three to five years and will expires unless, prior to expiration of the lease term, production in paying quantities is established.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	If the leases expire and we are unable to renew them, we will lose the right to develop the related properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	These changes include, among other proposals:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	These proposals were also included in President Obama s Proposed Fiscal Year 2014 Budget.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The passage of such legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. Federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	There is limited transportation and refining capacity for our black and yellow wax crude oil, which may limit our ability to sell our current production or to increase our production in the Uinta Basin.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Most of the crude oil we produce in the Uinta Basin is known as black wax or yellow wax because it has higher paraffin content than crude oil found in most other major North American basins.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Due to its wax content, the oil is heated in the field and transported in insulated trucks during shipping.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	At this time, our transportation options are limited.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Substantially all of our production is transported by truck to refiners in the Salt Lake City area.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We are exploring the feasibility of transporting future oil volumes by rail or pipeline.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P73_S3	We currently have agreements in place with area refiners that secure base load sales of substantially all of our expected production in the Uinta Basin through the end of 2016.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P73_S4	In addition, we have executed long-term supply agreements (7 and 10 years) with Tesoro (began in 2013) and HollyFrontier (expected to begin in 2015), who are expanding their local refineries.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P73_S5	The inability of Tesoro or HollyFrontier to complete their expansions or an extended loss of any of our largest purchasers or an inability to secure new markets outside of the Salt Lake City area could have a material adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of our black and yellow wax crude oil.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, infrastructure or capacity constraints and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We have risks associated with our non-U.S. operations .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental entity because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our international operations may also be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our international operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Exploration in international deepwater involves significant financial risks, and we may be unable to obtain the drilling rigs or support services necessary for our deepwater drilling and development programs in a timely manner or at acceptable rates .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Much of our international deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P80_S2	As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and requires substantial capital investment, and it is difficult to estimate the timing of our production.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Because of the size of significant projects in which we invest, we may not serve as the operator.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P80_S4	As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations related to these projects or their associated costs.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P80_S5	Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital or lead to unexpected future losses.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Competition for, or the loss of, our senior management or experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel and the loss of any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a seasoned management team and experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Competition for these professionals remains strong.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P81_S4	We are likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and retain these professionals.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil, gas and NGLs.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our competitors include national oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S4	In addition, high commodity prices and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S5	We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S6	Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P82_S7	As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for certain drilling rights if our competitors are seeking the same.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified field personnel could adversely affect financial condition and results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment as demand for that equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	These factors have caused significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Shortages of field personnel, drilling rigs, other equipment or supplies, or price increases, could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or restrict operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	See also The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S3	We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S6	Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P85_S7	We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability and other coverages.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	environmental issues, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).
912750_14_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P90_S1	No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions .
912750_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	As part of our business strategy, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	However, suitable acquisition properties may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, and acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P91_S3	These risks include that the acquired properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flows at anticipated levels.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Also, in pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire properties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	recoverable reserves; future oil and gas prices and their appropriate differentials; operating costs; and potential environmental and other liabilities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Inspections will not likely be performed on every well or facility, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P95_S2	In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P97_S1	We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had total indebtedness of $3.7 billion, including $0.6 billion in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P100_S2	The indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	These restrictions could limit our ability to:
912750_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	obtain future financing; make needed capital expenditures; plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; compete with similar companies that have less debt; withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general; or conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions, and to comply with other covenants and restrictions in our financing agreements, can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these obligations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P104_S3	This failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions, even if sufficient funds were available.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P105_S2	If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, or repay such debt with the proceeds from a sale of assets or a public offering of securities.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Factors that will affect our ability to successfully complete a public offering, refinance our debt or conduct an asset sale include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our Company.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to affect a change of control of our Company, to acquire us or to replace incumbent management.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P107_S2	In addition, our change of control severance plan and agreements and our omnibus stock plans contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, upon a change of control.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
912750_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of our Company.
912750_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	In August 2010, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alleging that we failed to provide adequate financial assurance for water injection wells falling under EPA jurisdiction that are located at our Greater Monument Butte Unit in Duchesne County, Utah (Monument Butte).
912750_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The injection wells are part of an enhanced oil recovery project designed to optimize production from Monument Butte.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) require operators of injection wells to file proof of financial assurance annually to cover the costs to plug and abandon the injection wells.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	The NOV alleges that our 2010 and 2009 filings (for 2009 and 2008) did not meet the financial ratio tests that are acceptable as one form of required financial assurance under SDWA regulations.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	The NOV did not contain any allegations of environmental spills, releases or pollution.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	Upon receipt of the NOV, we promptly complied with the EPA s request to put alternate financial assurance in place.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S4	We held preliminary discussions with the EPA regarding potential settlement of this matter; however, the EPA determined that the NOV could not be resolved administratively within the EPA s settlement authority under the SDWA, and therefore required a referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ).
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S5	Newfield and the EPA signed a consent decree which was lodged with the Utah federal district court on October 23, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S6	The EPA published the notice of the consent decree in the Federal Register on October 31, 2013, which began a 30-day comment period.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S7	No comments were received by the EPA.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S8	The court entered the consent decree as a final order on December 12, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S9	Newfield paid the civil penalty on December 13, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM3_P1_S10	The matter is now concluded and in three years, Newfield may request the court to terminate the consent decree subject to certain conditions in the decree.
912750_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

912750_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table shows selected consolidated financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
912750_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.
912750_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in North America.
912750_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our principal areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and the onshore Gulf Coast.
912750_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and find or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced.
912750_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and affect:
912750_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	In February 2013, we announced our decision to sell our international businesses in China and Malaysia.
912750_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	The decision to sell our international businesses followed a comprehensive review of the Company's strategy in which we decided to focus on our liquids-rich domestic resource areas.
912750_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	During the second quarter of 2013, our international businesses met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale and reported as discontinued operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	As such, the results of operations for our international businesses are reflected as discontinued operations and discussed further in Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report.
912750_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	On February 10, 2014, Newfield International Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the sale of our Malaysian business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad, a Malaysian public company, for $898 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments).
912750_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for additional information regarding the sale of our Malaysian business.
912750_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	In August of 2013, during the installation of the LF-7 topside facilities by a third-party contractor, a hydraulic jacking system malfunctioned and the installation was suspended.
912750_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The installation of the facility has been delayed and the potential cost and timing for the reinstallation is uncertain at this time.
912750_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	As a result of this incident, the timing of the China divestiture has been delayed.
912750_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our continuing operations consist of exploration, development and production activities in the United States.
912750_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The production and average realized prices tables below include our Gulf of Mexico operations for 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	In the current year discussion below, we excluded revenue of $116 million and production of 2,369 MBOE related to our Gulf of Mexico assets that were fully divested in the fourth quarter of 2012 in order to provide a more comparable analysis of our continuing operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Revenues from continuing operations of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 32% higher than 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The increase was primarily due to higher liquids production and commodity prices.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our liquids production increased 43% year-over-year.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	As expected, our natural gas production declined as we continue to focus capital investments on higher-margin liquids production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	Approximately 58% of the revenue increase was attributable to increases in oil production in our Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains regions of 47%, 59% and 18%, respectively.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	Higher realized oil prices also increased revenues along with this favorable volume variance.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S6	Additionally, revenues increased 21% due to year-over-year NGL production increases in the Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains regions of 180%, 59% and 23%, respectively, partially offset by lower NGL prices.
912750_14_ITEM7_P8_S7	While natural gas production declined 14%, a 29% increase in the realized price during the period more than offset the negative production impact on revenue.
912750_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, our revenues from continuing operations decreased $266 million, or 15%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	combined with an 18% decrease in natural gas production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Consistent with our continued focus on increasing our liquids production, a 10% increase in our crude oil and condensate production partially offset the natural decline resulting from reduced investment in natural gas wells in 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Increased NGL production of 30% was more than offset by a 30% decline in NGL prices during 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	The following table reflects our production from continuing operations and average realized commodity prices for the following periods:
912750_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, production from continuing operations increased 7%.
912750_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Crude oil and NGL production increased 43% but was partially offset by decreases in natural gas production across our domestic regions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The decrease in natural gas production was due to natural decline as a result of reduced investment in natural gas wells.
912750_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	More than half of the increase in total liquids was attributable to higher margin crude oil in 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our 2012 domestic oil, natural gas and NGL production, stated on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, decreased 9% compared to 2011 production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The decrease relates primarily to the sale of assets in the Gulf of Mexico and natural declines in our natural gas assets due to lack of investment as our investments have been focused on oil and liquids projects.
912750_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our domestic oil and liquids production increased approximately 13% in 2012 when compared to the prior year.
912750_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following table presents information about operating expenses for our continuing operations for the following periods:
912750_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, total operating expenses for continuing operations increased 7% but were flat on a per BOE basis after adjusting for the 2012 ceiling test writedown and operating expenses of $102 million attributable to Gulf of Mexico assets that were fully divested in the fourth quarter of 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The components of significant period-to-period change for operating expenses excluding Gulf of Mexico related expenses related to 2012 are as follows:
912750_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Lease operating expenses (LOE) include normally recurring expenses necessary to operate and produce our oil and gas wells, non-recurring well workover and repair-related expenses and the costs to process and transport our production to the applicable sales points.
912750_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	On a unit-of-production basis, lease operating expenses were 13% higher than 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The increase was primarily due to fees related to additional NGL processing costs in all basins and increased infrastructure operating costs in the Uinta Basin.
912750_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Production and other taxes were flat on an actual cost and per unit basis.
912750_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, on a percent of revenue basis, they fell approximately 1%.
912750_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	This rate reduction is primarily attributable to production tax credits received in the Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Uinta basins plus an $8 million adjustment of ad valorem taxes in the Uinta Basin previously expensed in 2012 and prior years.
912750_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	Without the ad valorem tax adjustment in the Uinta Basin, production and other taxes on a percent of revenue basis would have decreased by less than a half of a percent.
912750_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	General and administrative (G A) expense increased during 2013 primarily due to employee-related expenses associated with our Voluntary Severance Program and Stock Value Appreciation Program (see Note 13, "Voluntary Severance Program," and Note 11, "Stock-Based Compensation," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report) partially offset by the cost savings generated by the centralization of several administrative functions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	During 2013, we capitalized $107 million ($2.77 per BOE) of direct internal costs as compared to $95 million ($2.45 per BOE) during 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.5 billion due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The primary reason for the change in value was negative price-related reserve revisions as a result of a 33% decrease in the natural gas SEC pricing.
912750_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Other expenses in 2012 of $15 million included a writedown of $8 million of subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets and contract termination costs of $6 million in consideration of other services.
912750_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses for our continuing operations for the following periods:
912750_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Excluding the ceiling test writedown, the increase in our depletion rate due to price-related downward reserve revisions and the impact of selling our offshore Gulf of Mexico assets, our operating expenses increased 21%.
912750_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The components of the significant period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	LOE includes normally recurring expenses necessary to operate and produce our oil and gas wells, non-recurring well workover and repair-related expenses and the costs to transport our production to the applicable sales points.
912750_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	LOE increased $0.29 per BOE to $5.56 per BOE.
912750_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase was due to higher compression, fuel, electricity, and rental equipment costs coupled with declining natural gas production in our Mid-Continent region.
912750_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Partially offsetting this increase, was improved recurring LOE per unit in our Rocky Mountain and Onshore Gulf Coast regions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	Increases in our non-recurring LOE of $42 million accounted for 87% of the increase in total domestic LOE primarily due to the following:
912750_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	transportation costs related to firm transportation agreements in our Mid-Continent region accounted for $0.47 per BOE of the increase.
912750_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our average depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) rate increased $2.99 per BOE during 2012 and reflects our continued focus on oil and liquids rich gas developments that are more capital intensive on a per BOE basis as compared to natural gas developments.
912750_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	While our average DD A rate in 2011 was $14.75, our rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $16.61.
912750_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	During 2012, this rate increased as the additional cost of each BOE added was higher.
912750_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	In addition, the full year average rate was negatively impacted by downward reserve revisions (primarily due to natural gas price declines) combined with the net impact of selling our remaining Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	Without these items, our average DD A rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been $17.34.
912750_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	G A expense per BOE increased during 2012 primarily due to employee-related expenses associated with our domestic work force combined with lower domestic production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	During 2012, we capitalized $95 million ($2.45 per BOE) of direct internal costs as compared to $83 million ($1.98 per BOE) during 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of approximately $1.5 billion ($38.63 per BOE) due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The primary reason for the change in value was negative price-related reserve revisions as a result of a 33% decrease in the natural gas SEC pricing.
912750_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Other expenses of $15 million ($0.38 per BOE) included a writedown of $8 million of subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets and contract termination costs of $6 million in consideration of other services.
912750_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years ended December 31:
912750_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Gross interest expense remained flat in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the restructuring of our senior notes in 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in gross interest expense in 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily resulted from the September 2011 issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 % Senior Notes due 2022, as well as the June 2012 issuance of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 % Senior Notes due 2024, partially offset by the redemption in April 2012 of our $325 million 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and in July 2012 of our $550 million 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016.
912750_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	See Note 9, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Interest expense associated with oil and gas properties excluded from amortization is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Capitalized interest decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 and in 2012 as compared to 2011, due to a reduction in our average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization.
912750_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The fluctuations in commodity derivative income (expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these periods.
912750_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were 37%, 36% and 35%, respectively.
912750_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 was different than the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to non-deductible expenses and state income taxes.
912750_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Please see the discussion and tables in Note 10, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices; the timing, amount and location of future production; operating expenses; and capital costs.
912750_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our international revenues are primarily derived from the sale of crude oil.
912750_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs, or onshore storage terminals, and "lifted" and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into FPSOs.
912750_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	As a result, timing of liftings may impact period-to-period results.
912750_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	In early February 2014, we closed the sale of our Malaysia business.
912750_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for additional information regarding the sale.
912750_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, revenues from discontinued operations were $891 million, a decrease of 18% over 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	The decrease in revenue was primarily due to fewer liftings of crude oil.
912750_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	Revenues of $1.1 billion for 2012 were 50% higher than 2011, mainly due to a 48% increase in liftings of crude oil primarily in Malaysia.
912750_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	The overall price per BOE remained essentially flat during 2013, 2012 and 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	The following table reflects our production from discontinued operations and average realized commodity prices for the each of the years ended December 31.
912750_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	________________ (1) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our 2013 total liftings from discontinued operations decreased 18% as compared to 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Approximately 65% of the decrease in liftings was due to natural decline.
912750_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The remainder of the decrease is due to the timing of liftings and the terms of our production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Malaysia, which reduce entitled production as we reach certain cost recovery milestones.
912750_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Our 2012 total liftings increased by 48% over 2011 levels, primarily due to an increase of 53% in Malaysia production resulting from continued successful drilling on the East Belamut field, as well as full-year production on the East Piatu and Puteri fields, brought online during the fourth quarter of 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses for our discontinued operations for the following periods:
912750_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our operating expenses for discontinued operations for 2013, stated on a BOE basis, increased 27% over 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The components of the period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	LOE per BOE increased 41% ($4.38 per BOE) due to increased service costs related to offshore support operations in Malaysia and mostly-fixed fees associated with producing into onshore storage terminals in Malaysia combined with fewer liftings.
912750_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Production and other taxes per BOE increased 26% due to the terms of our PSCs in Malaysia, which increase production tax rates subsequent to reaching certain cost recovery milestones.
912750_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	DD A expense decreased 3% due to an 18% decrease in liftings during 2013 as compared to 2012, partially offset by an increase in the average DD A rate.
912750_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our DD A rate per BOE increased 18% in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to upward revisions of asset retirement costs in 2013 for Malaysia and the costs of unsuccessful wells in offshore Malaysia and China being included in costs subject to amortization in the second quarter of 2013 without a related increase in reserves.
912750_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	G A expense increased approximately $11 million ($1.43 per BOE) primarily due to increased employee-related costs and other costs associated with our decision to sell our international businesses.
912750_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses for our discontinued operations for the following periods:
912750_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our operating expenses for discontinued operations for 2012, stated on a BOE basis, decreased 13% over 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The components of the period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	LOE per BOE decreased by 24% ($3.42 per BOE) primarily due to lower non-recurring workover activity during 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Recurring LOE was essentially flat on a per unit basis with a decrease of $0.13 per BOE, or 1%.
912750_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Production and other taxes per BOE decreased by 30% due to an overall change in the mix of production that was lifted and sold from the various PSCs in Malaysia including the fields brought online during the fourth quarter of 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The production tax rates per barrel of oil lifted and sold from these newer developments were lower, per the terms of the PSCs, while we recovered our costs associated with these developments.
912750_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	DD A expense increased 87% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to a combination of an increase in the average DD A rate and a 50% increase in production during 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	DD A per BOE increased 25% when compared to the 2011 rate.
912750_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The average annual 2012 rate when compared to the end of 2011 rate of $24.45 was 10% higher and was primarily due to the costs of two unsuccessful wells in offshore Malaysia, which increased the amount subject to depletion without any associated reserve additions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The following is inclusive of both our continuing and discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.
912750_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and property acquisitions, which require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as further described below.
912750_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, as well as the available borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility.
912750_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Our 2014 budget will be financed through our cash flows from operations, proceeds from our recent Malaysian sale and the use of our credit facility.
912750_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	Approximately 89% of our expected 2014 domestic oil and gas production (excluding NGLs) supporting the current 2014 capital budget estimate is hedged.
912750_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	Our 2014 capital budget for our continuing operations, excluding estimated capitalized interest and overhead of $182 million, is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion and focuses on liquids-rich projects with higher returns, which we believe generate and lay the foundation for liquids production growth in 2015 and thereafter.
912750_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	Depending on the timing of the sale of our China business, we intend to invest approximately $100 million in China.
912750_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets sold.
912750_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.
912750_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	We believe that our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our asset portfolio will be adequate to fund 2014 operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	We maintain a revolving credit facility of $1.4 billion that matures in June 2018, as well as money market lines of credit of $160 million at December 31, 2013, for a total borrowing capacity of $1.6 billion.
912750_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	At December 31, 2013, we had $585 million of LIBOR based loans outstanding against our revolving credit facility and $64 million outstanding against our money market lines of credit.
912750_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	At December 31, 2013, we had no scheduled maturities of senior notes or senior subordinated notes until 2018.
912750_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	As of December 31, 2013, we had $58 million of undrawn letters of credit related to our Malaysian business outstanding under our credit facility, which were terminated in February 2014 upon the closing of the sale of our Malaysian business.
912750_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	Also in connection with the sale of our Malaysian business, we paid in full amounts previously outstanding under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_14_ITEM7_P56_S5	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior and senior subordinated notes, please see Note 9, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report.
912750_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	At February 24, 2014, we had no letters of credit or borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately $1.6 billion.
912750_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners.
912750_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital.
912750_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	We anticipate that our 2014 capital investment levels will exceed our estimate of cash flows from operations and as a result, we will use proceeds from our recent Malaysian sale along with our credit arrangements to fund the shortfall.
912750_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had negative working capital of $389 million and $93 million, respectively.
912750_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The changes in our working capital are primarily a result of the timing of the collection of receivables, changes in the fair value of our derivative positions, the timing of crude oil liftings in our international operations, drilling activities, payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our primary source of capital and liquidity are cash flows from operations and are primarily affected by our production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital.
912750_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	We typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within 45-60 days of production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by DD A, ceiling test writedowns, other impairments or other non-cash charges or credits.
912750_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our net cash flows from operations were approximately $1.4 billion (includes $334 million of cash flows from discontinued operations) in 2013, $1.1 billion in 2012 and $1.6 billion in 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	The changes in cash flows from operations in 2013 compared to 2012, were primarily as a result of higher cash flows from operating activities due to increased production and prices, and changes in working capital.
912750_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Net cash used in investing activities for 2013 was $2.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion for 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase was due to increased capital expenditures combined with fewer asset sales in 2013 compared to 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 was $620 million compared to $24 million for 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	During 2013 we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit by $649 million to fund capital expenditures, and paid $20 million to repurchase the preferred shares of our now wholly-owned subsidiary, Newfield China, LDC.
912750_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our capital investments of $2.0 billion for 2013 increased 17% from our capital investments of $1.7 billion during 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $125 million and $9 million, and capitalized interest and overhead of $197 million and $191 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
912750_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Of the total $2.0 billion invested during 2013, we invested $1.3 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $218 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $90 million in leasing domestic proved and unproved property (leasehold), $20 million in pipeline spending, $72 million in acquisitions, $23 million in plug and abandonment settlements and $344 million outside the United States.
912750_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our capital investments of $1.7 billion for 2012 decreased 26% from our capital investments of $2.3 billion during 2011.
912750_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $9 million and $33 million and capitalized interest and overhead of $191 million and $194 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
912750_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	Of the total $1.7 billion invested during 2012, we invested $1.3 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $153 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $67 million in leasing domestic proved and unproved property (leasehold), $23 million in plug and abandonment settlements and $225 million outside the United States.
912750_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis.
912750_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations by maturity as of December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	_________________ (1) Includes agreements for office space, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for office space and drilling rigs, and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	(2) Includes agreements for office space, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	Due to our various working interests where these service contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S5	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S6	(3) As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S7	We have work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, platform construction, obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other related commitments.
912750_14_ITEM7_P71_S8	At December 31, 2013, these work-related commitments totaled $245 million, all of which were attributable to our international business.
912750_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted.
912750_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	(4) Of the total $465 million of contractual obligations from discontinued operations, $295 million is related to our Malaysian business.
912750_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	In early February 2014, we closed the sale of our Malaysian business and therefore are no longer subject to these obligations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions, we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments.
912750_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	However, in the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $2.67 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM7_P74_S4	As of December 31, 2013, our delivery commitments through 2024 were as follows:
912750_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	_________________ (1) Our oil delivery commitments include a particular commitment with a Salt Lake City, Utah refiner.
912750_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	This delivery commitment will begin upon the refiner completing the expansion of their facility, which is expected in late 2015.
912750_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	Our delivery commitment is to deliver approximately 20,000 barrels of oil per day over a 10 -year period.
912750_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	This delivery commitment represents approximately 7,300 MBbls of our committed oil volumes for each of the years 2016 through 2024.
912750_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	The timing may change due to timing of the completion of the refinery expansion.
912750_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We use derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months.
912750_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production or production associated with our discontinued operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period.
912750_14_ITEM7_P76_S4	In addition, we may use basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see " Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities" below and " Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices " in Item 7A of this report.
912750_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	Please see the discussion and tables in Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 8, "Fair Value Measurements," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Between January 1, 2014 and February 24, 2014, we entered into additional derivative contracts as set forth below.
912750_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	________________ (1) Our fixed-price swaps with sold puts for 2016 are for January through March 2016.
912750_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Between January 1, 2014 and February 24, 2014, we also sold crude oil swaption contracts that would potentially hedge 1,548 MBbls of calendar year 2015 production if exercised on their expiration date of May 30, 2014.
912750_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	These contracts give the counterparties the option to enter into swap contracts with us at a weighted average price of $90.29/Bbl.
912750_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S5	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_14_ITEM7_P84_S6	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories.
912750_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category.
912750_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method.
912750_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates:
912750_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company.
912750_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Stock-based compensation costs require estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments.
912750_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules.
912750_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost.
912750_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment.
912750_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs.
912750_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two-step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to see if an impairment is required.
912750_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	If required, the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward looking prices.
912750_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	Impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using SEC pricing, costs in effect at year-end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on SEC pricing and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_14_ITEM7_P95_S3	Changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM7_P95_S4	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Estimated proved oil, gas and NGL reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DD A expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown.
912750_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	To change our diluted earnings per share for continuing operations by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2013, our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.20 per BOE which would require a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 1%, or 7 MMBOE.
912750_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The ceiling value of oil, gas and NGL reserves is calculated based on SEC pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	At December 31, 2013, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $ 3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas and $ 96.82 per barrel for oil.
912750_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	Using these prices, the U.S. cost center ceiling exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $445 million, net of tax, and as such, no ceiling test writedown was required.
912750_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	Holding all other factors constant, it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in the U.S. if the applicable average oil and natural gas prices declined approximately 6% from prices used at December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Given the fluctuation of oil, natural gas and NGL prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term.
912750_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	If commodity prices decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future.
912750_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties.
912750_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base.
912750_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_14_ITEM7_P101_S4	If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.
912750_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization.
912750_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled).
912750_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work.
912750_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated.
912750_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage.
912750_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	had a total of approximately $1.3 billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools, the majority of which related to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	Inclusion of some or all of our domestic unevaluated property costs in our domestic full cost pool, without adding any associated reserves, would have resulted in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants.
912750_14_ITEM7_P106_S3	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates.
912750_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
912750_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	To change our diluted earnings per share for continuing operations by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2013, our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.20 per BOE which would require a change in estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 3%, or $118 million.
912750_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date.
912750_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date.
912750_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties.
912750_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as goodwill.
912750_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.
912750_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	The value allocated to recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above.
912750_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	The accounting standard for business combinations establishes how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
912750_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction.
912750_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	We do not designate future price-risk management activities as accounting hedges.
912750_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	As of December 31, 2013, we had net derivative liabilities of $36 million, of which 33%, based on total hedged volumes, was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black-Scholes) and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative.
912750_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts.
912750_14_ITEM7_P119_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility, as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_14_ITEM7_P119_S3	As a result, the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than the fair value as of December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	The determination of the fair value of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	For equity-based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period, as well as a Stockholder Value Appreciation Program which pays certain employees a cash payment based on increases in our stock price.
912750_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance regarding the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
912750_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
912750_14_ITEM7_P124_S2	We adopted the guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P124_S3	Adoption of the new reporting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities.
912750_14_ITEM7_P125_S1	The guidance requires disclosure of both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement.
912750_14_ITEM7_P125_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P125_S3	We adopted the guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM7_P125_S4	Adoption of the additional disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation.
912750_14_ITEM7_P126_S2	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM7_P126_S3	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_14_ITEM7_P126_S4	Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business, in Item 1A of this report.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	At December 31, 2013, nine of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our estimated future hedged production, with no single counterparty accounting for more than 15% of that production.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2013, our debt was comprised of:
912750_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 82% of our obligations were at fixed rates as of December 31, 2013, and our variable rate debt was at interest rates of 2% or less.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In early February 2014, we closed the sale of our Malaysian business and paid in full amounts previously outstanding under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992), the management of our Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newfield Exploration Company:
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_14_ITEM8_P6_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

912750_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
912750_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).
912750_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Our principal areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and the onshore Gulf Coast regions of North America.
912750_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to Newfield, we, us, our or the Company are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Our businesses in Malaysia and China were classified as held-for-sale in the second quarter of 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," for additional disclosures.
912750_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	These financial statements and notes are inclusive of our international operations unless otherwise noted.
912750_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing impairment of our oil and gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
912750_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Our most significant financial estimates are associated with our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and the fair value of our derivative positions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.
912750_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	These reclassifications, including those related to our discontinued operations disclosed in Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," did not impact our net income (loss), stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company's production and other taxes for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, were reduced by approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter due to a prior period adjustment related to our 2012 and prior ad valorem tax accrual to reflect the actual amounts payable at December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company's general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013, were reduced by approximately $8 million due to a prior period adjustment related to our 2012 bonus accrual to reflect actual amounts approved and paid in the first quarter of 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company s discontinued operations deferred tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was increased by approximately $15 million due to prior period adjustments related to our 2012 repatriation of international earnings and a valuation allowance on a Malaysian deferred tax asset.
912750_14_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company believes these correcting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2013 were not material to its prior consolidated financial statements or its quarterly or annual results for the period ended December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Substantially all of our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold at market-based prices to a variety of purchasers under short-term contracts (less than 12 months).
912750_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	We also have long-term contracts in the Uinta Basin at market-based prices.
912750_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	Revenues from the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Under the sales method, the Company and other joint owners may sell more or less than their entitled share of production.
912750_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Should the Company s excess sales exceed our share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves, a liability is recorded.
912750_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	Differences between sales and our entitled share of production are not significant.
912750_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Other, net on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Restricted cash and the associated deferred liability on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013, represent a deposit received in 2013 on the pending sale of our Malaysian business.
912750_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Amounts are contractually restricted until the transaction closes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P30_S2	See Note 17, "Subsequent Events," for further discussion about the close of the sale of the Malaysian business in early February 2014.
912750_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Investments consist of debt and equity securities, as well as auction rate securities, a majority of which are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value.
912750_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
912750_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	We realized interest income and net gains on our investment securities in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 of $3 million , $3 million and $2 million , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.
912750_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Generally, our oil and gas receivables are collected within 45 to 60 days of production.
912750_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated.
912750_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our offshore operations in Malaysia and China.
912750_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations" for details on our international crude oil inventory.
912750_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Tubular goods and well equipment inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	At December 31, 2012 , we wrote down subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	The writedown of $8 million is included in Operating expenses Other on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	We capitalized approximately $145 million , $123 million and $113 million of internal costs in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Interest expense related to unproved properties also is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	A particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas and NGL prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.82 per barrel for oil.
912750_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	Using these prices, the cost center ceiling with respect to our domestic full cost pool exceeded the net capitalized costs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P43_S3	As such, no ceiling test writedown was required at December 31, 2013 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P43_S4	If there are declines in SEC pricing of oil and natural gas subsequent to December 31, 2013 , we may be required to record a ceiling test writedown in future periods.
912750_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	At December 31, 2012 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.84 per barrel for oil.
912750_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.5 billion ( $948 million , after-tax).
912750_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	At December 31, 2011 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.13 per barrel for oil.
912750_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	Using these prices, the cost center ceiling with respect to our domestic full cost pool exceeded the net capitalized costs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	As such, no ceiling test writedown was required at December 31, 2011 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	See Note 4, Oil and Gas Assets, for a detailed discussion regarding our acquisition and sales transactions during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Gathering systems and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 25 years.
912750_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Our continuing operations are comprised of a single business segment, the domestic exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas.
912750_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	Prior to classifying our international businesses as held-for-sale and discontinued operations, we reported business segments for Malaysia and China.
912750_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the ARO is incurred.
912750_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	Settlements include payments made to satisfy the AROs, as well as transfer of the ARO to purchasers of our divested properties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will equal the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for our Company.
912750_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds, and the original capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	The change in our ARO for continuing operations for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	_________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2012, settlements include $28 million related to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	See Note 4, Oil and Gas Assets.
912750_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, liabilities and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
912750_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	We accrue for losses when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
912750_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, for a more detailed discussion regarding our contingencies.
912750_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed as incurred.
912750_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based upon evaluations of currently available facts related to each site.
912750_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did not accrue related interest or penalties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	The tax years 2010-2013 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	For equity-based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units as well as a Stockholder Value Appreciation Program that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	Our joint interest partners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers.
912750_14_ITEM8_P61_S3	If the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general was adversely affected, the ability of our joint interest partners to reimburse us could be adversely affected.
912750_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	The purchasers of our oil, gas and NGL production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Historically, we have sold our oil, gas and NGLs to several purchasers.
912750_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The use of hedging transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	The counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	We monitor the credit ratings of our hedging counterparties on an ongoing basis.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S3	Although we have entered into hedging contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S4	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S5	At December 31, 2013 , nine of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our estimated future hedged production, with no single counterparty accounting for more than 15% of that production.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S6	A portion of our derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility.
912750_14_ITEM8_P65_S7	Our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Tesoro Corporation accounted for 13% , 12% and 11% respectively, of our total revenues in 2013 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	During 2012 , Royal Dutch Shell plc, Tesoro Corporation and Big West Oil LLC accounted for 14% , 14% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	During 2011 , sales of our oil and gas production to Royal Dutch Shell plc and Tesoro Corporation accounted for 12% and 11% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_14_ITEM8_P66_S3	We believe that the loss of Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC or Royal Dutch Shell plc would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are readily available.
912750_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	purchasers of the black and yellow wax crude oil, which we produce from this field.
912750_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Due to the higher paraffin content of this production, it must remain heated during shipping, so it cannot be transported in conventional pipelines, and there is limited refining capacity for it in the vicinity of our production.
912750_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	In poor economic environments and tight financial markets, there is an increased risk that the current purchasers of our production may fail to satisfy their obligations to us under our crude oil purchase contracts.
912750_14_ITEM8_P67_S3	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to sell to these purchasers or that similar substitute arrangements could be made for sales of our black and yellow wax crude oil with other purchasers if desired.
912750_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Our derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.
912750_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	While all of the derivative instruments that we utilize are to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance.
912750_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	We periodically utilize derivatives to manage our exposure to variable interest rates.
912750_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
912750_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	See Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet accordingly.
912750_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	See Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," for details regarding the gross amounts, as well as the impact of our netting arrangements on our net derivative position.
912750_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	We only offset assets and liabilities in relation to our derivative financial instruments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	At December 31, 2012, accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) included unrealized losses related to auction rate securities that were deemed to be temporary as the Company had the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
912750_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company changed its intention and will likely sell the securities for a loss during 2014.
912750_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	As a result, the losses previously accumulated in AOCI related to these securities have been transferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P72_S3	The change in AOCI for the indicated periods is set forth below:
912750_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance regarding the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
912750_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
912750_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	We adopted the guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	Adoption of the new reporting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities.
912750_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance requires disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement.
912750_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	We adopted the guidance in the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P74_S4	Adoption of the additional disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income, less any applicable adjustments, (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (excluding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Diluted EPS incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for the indicated years:
912750_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes 4.0 million and 1.4 million shares of unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units and stock options for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011 , respectively, because including the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	(2) The effect of unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units and stock options has not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_14_ITEM8_P78_S2	Had we recognized income from continuing operations for that year, incremental shares attributable to the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options would have increased diluted weighted-averages shares outstanding by 0.7 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P78_S3	(3) The numerator includes an adjustment of $20 million related to the repurchase of preferred shares of a now wholly-owned subsidiary, which reduces net income (loss) for purposes of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P78_S4	The subsidiary is part of our discontinued operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P78_S5	See Note 16, "Related Party Transaction," for additional information.
912750_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	In February 2013, we announced our decision to explore strategic alternatives for our international businesses.
912750_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	In accordance with specific accounting requirements, we met the criteria to classify our international businesses as held-for-sale and discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P79_S2	As a result, the historical results of operations for our Malaysia and China businesses are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	As discussed in Note 17, "Subsequent Events," we closed the sale of our Malaysia business on February 10, 2014.
912750_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	In August of 2013, during the installation of the LF-7 topside facilities by a third-party contractor, a hydraulic jacking system malfunctioned and the installation was suspended.
912750_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	The installation of the facility has been delayed and the potential cost and timing for the reinstallation is uncertain at this time.
912750_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	As a result of this incident, the timing of the China divestiture has been delayed.
912750_14_ITEM8_P81_S3	The Company continues to actively market its China business.
912750_14_ITEM8_P81_S4	After reevaluating the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations, we believe that our China operations continue to meet the held for sale criteria and therefore remain in discontinued operations as of December 31, 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P81_S5	We will continue to monitor the facts and circumstances surrounding the completion of the production facilities and sale of our China operations on a quarterly basis.
912750_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	________________ (1) Certain payments to foreign governments made on our behalf that are part of the revenue process are recorded as a reduction of the related oil and gas revenues.
912750_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The effective tax rates for our discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were 81% , 166% and 37% , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	Historically, our international effective tax rate was approximately 37% .
912750_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	However, the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were affected by our decision to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations, which resulted in net income of our international businesses being taxed both in the U.S. and the local country, and the recording of a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset in Malaysia.
912750_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in Malaysia and China is produced into floating production, storage and off-loading vessels (FPSOs) or onshore storage terminals and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	The product inventory from our international operations consisted of approximately 1.1 million barrels and 0.7 million barrels of crude oil valued at cost of $90 million and $64 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and are included in the "Inventories" line item in the preceding table and our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	Cost for purposes of the carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of production costs and depletion expense.
912750_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the oil and gas properties associated with our discontinued operations included $115 million not subject to amortization, comprised of $45 million incurred prior to 2011, $2 million incurred in 2011, $24 million incurred in 2012 and $44 million incurred in 2013.
912750_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	At December 31, 2013, we performed a fair value assessment of our Malaysia and China discontinued operations, noting no indication of impairment based on the current carrying value.
912750_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	During 2012, when our Malaysia and China businesses were reported as continuing operations, we performed a ceiling test for each full cost pool.
912750_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	The ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.84 per barrel for oil.
912750_14_ITEM8_P87_S2	At December 31, 2011 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.13 per barrel for oil.
912750_14_ITEM8_P87_S3	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our Malaysia and China full cost pools exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective cost centers at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and as such, no ceiling test writedowns were required.
912750_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	The change in our ARO for discontinued operations for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	Oil and gas properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which we own an interest.
912750_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	These unproved property costs include unevaluated leasehold acreage, geological and geophysical data costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, costs associated with wells in progress at December 31 and capitalized internal costs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P90_S2	We exclude these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired.
912750_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	Unproved property costs are grouped by major prospect area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant.
912750_14_ITEM8_P91_S1	Costs associated with wells in progress are transferred to the amortization base upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results.
912750_14_ITEM8_P91_S2	All other costs excluded from the amortization base are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred.
912750_14_ITEM8_P91_S3	The amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for international operations if a reserve base has not yet been established.
912750_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following is a summary of our oil and gas properties not subject to amortization as of December 31, 2013 .
912750_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	At December 31, 2013 , approximately 82% of our oil and gas properties not subject to amortization were associated with unconventional resource plays.
912750_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	Because of the size of our unconventional resource plays, the entire evaluation can take significantly longer than four years.
912750_14_ITEM8_P92_S3	However, we believe that our evaluation activities related to substantially all of our conventional properties not subject to amortization will be completed within four years .
912750_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	In October 2012, we closed the sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W T Offshore, Inc. for approximately $208 million , subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	The sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_14_ITEM8_P93_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of sale.
912750_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million .
912750_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	The assets include approximately 65,000 net acres, which are largely undeveloped and located north of our Greater Monument Butte Unit.
912750_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	During 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $72 million , $9 million and $1 million , respectively, and sold certain oil and gas properties for proceeds of approximately $36 million , $630 million (includes Gulf of Mexico asset sale discussed above) and $406 million , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_14_ITEM8_P95_S2	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	We utilize the following derivative strategies, which consist of either a single derivative instrument or a combination of instruments, to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and natural gas production domestically.
912750_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	With respect to a swap position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price.
912750_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	Collars (combination of purchased put options (floor) and sold call options (ceiling)) .
912750_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	strike price while we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling strike price.
912750_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor strike price and equal to or less than the ceiling strike price.
912750_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	A swap with a sold put position consists of a standard swap position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the associated fixed-price swap.
912750_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	This structure enables us to increase the fixed-price swap with the value received through the sale of the put.
912750_14_ITEM8_P100_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the put strike price, then we will only receive the difference between the swap price and the put strike price.
912750_14_ITEM8_P100_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard swap only.
912750_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	A collar with a sold put position consists of a standard collar position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the floor strike price of the collar.
912750_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	This structure enables us to improve the collar strike prices with the value received through the sale of the additional put.
912750_14_ITEM8_P101_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the additional put strike price, then we will receive the difference between the floor strike price and the additional put strike price.
912750_14_ITEM8_P101_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar only.
912750_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk adjustments using credit default swaps and time to maturity.
912750_14_ITEM8_P103_S2	The calculation of the fair value of collars and sold puts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_14_ITEM8_P103_S3	See Note 8, Fair Value Measurements.
912750_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	At December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding positions with respect to our future production as set forth in the tables below.
912750_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in Commodity derivative income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments was as follows:
912750_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	________ (1) The total realized gain on commodity derivatives may differ from the cash receipts on derivative settlements as a result of the receipt or payment of premiums, or due to the recognition of premiums previously received associated with derivatives settled during the period.
912750_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_14_ITEM8_P111_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_14_ITEM8_P112_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps and certain investments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as commodity options (price collars and sold puts) and other financial investments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	Our valuation methodology for investments is a discounted cash flow model that considers various inputs including: (a) the coupon rate specified under the debt instruments, (b) the current credit ratings of the underlying issuers, (c) collateral characteristics and (d) risk-adjusted discount rates.
912750_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	Our valuation model for the Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP) is a Monte Carlo simulation that is based on a probability model and considers various inputs including: (a) the measurement date stock price, (b) time value and (c) historical and implied volatility.
912750_14_ITEM8_P117_S1	See Note 11, "Stock-Based Compensation," for a description of the SVAP.
912750_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_14_ITEM8_P118_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
912750_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of our financial assets (liabilities) of our continuing operations by measurement levels:
912750_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	The determination of the fair values above incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), if any.
912750_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods:
912750_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	We utilize a discounted cash flow model in the determination of the valuation of our auction rate securities classified as Level 3.
912750_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	This model considers various inputs including (a) the coupon rate specified under the debt instrument, (b) the current credit rating of the underlying issuers, (c) collateral characteristics and (d) risk-adjusted discount rates.
912750_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	The most significant unobservable factor in the determination of the investments fair value, however, is market liquidity for these instruments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P123_S3	A significant change in the liquidity of the market for auction rate securities would lead to a corresponding change in the fair value measurement of these investments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we held $39 million of auction rate securities maturing beginning in 2033 that are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	net" on our consolidated statement of operations as a result of our decision to liquidate our auction rate investments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P125_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , we held $36 million of auction rate securities, which reflected a decrease in the fair value of $9 million ( $6 million net of tax) recorded under the caption "Accumulated other comprehensive income" on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_14_ITEM8_P125_S2	The debt instruments underlying our auction rate securities are mostly investment grade (rated BBB or better) and are guaranteed by the United States government or backed by private loan collateral.
912750_14_ITEM8_P125_S3	Please see Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for additional disclosure regarding our auction rate securities.
912750_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	Our valuation models for Level 3 derivative option contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various factors, including certain significant unobservable inputs such as (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) volatility factors and (c) counterparty credit risk.
912750_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_14_ITEM8_P127_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the strike prices fixed by the hedge agreements, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts.
912750_14_ITEM8_P127_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	Significant increases (decreases) in the quoted forward prices for commodities generally lead to corresponding decreases (increases) in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_14_ITEM8_P129_S0	Significant changes in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors that include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_14_ITEM8_P130_S1	Historically, we have not experienced significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	The calculation of the fair value of the SVAP liability requires the use of a probability-based Monte Carlo simulation, which requires the use of unobservable inputs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P131_S1	The simulation predicts multiple scenarios of future stock return over the performance period, which are discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_14_ITEM8_P131_S2	The fair value is recognized over a service period derived from the simulation.
912750_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Future stock returns and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility.
912750_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	Significant increases (decreases) in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant increases (decreases) in the fair value measurement of the SVAP liability.
912750_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	The underlying inputs in the determination of the valuation of our auction rate securities are developed by a third party and, therefore, not included in the quantitative analysis above.
912750_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as of December 31, was as follows:
912750_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	Any amounts outstanding under our credit arrangements at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	At December 31, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	_________________ (1) Because capacity under our credit facility was available to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations, if any, are classified as long-term.
912750_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	In April 2013, we entered into the second amendment to the credit facility, which allows the sale of the Company's international businesses pursuant to certain terms and conditions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P138_S1	In June 2013, we entered into the third amendment of our Credit Agreement.
912750_14_ITEM8_P138_S2	This amendment extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from June 2016 to June 2018 and increased the borrowing capacity from $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion .
912750_14_ITEM8_P138_S3	We incurred $4 million of deferred financing costs related to this amendment.
912750_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 14% of total commitments.
912750_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating ( 75 basis points per annum at December 31, 2013 ) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating ( 175 basis points per annum at December 31, 2013 ).
912750_14_ITEM8_P141_S0	Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating ( 30 basis points per annum at December 31, 2013 ).
912750_14_ITEM8_P141_S1	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our current and previous credit facilities of approximately $3 million , $3 million and $2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, which are recorded in Interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns and goodwill impairments) to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_14_ITEM8_P142_S1	At December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we had $58 million letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_14_ITEM8_P143_S1	Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating ( 175 basis points at December 31, 2013 ).
912750_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, at December 31, 2013 , we also had a total of $96 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; a change of control; or certain other material adverse changes in our business.
912750_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	Our senior notes and senior subordinated notes also contain standard events of default.
912750_14_ITEM8_P145_S2	If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_14_ITEM8_P145_S3	In addition, our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	In June 2012, we issued $1 billion of 5 % Senior Notes due 2024 and received proceeds of $990 million (net of offering costs).
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	These notes were issued at par to yield 5 %.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S2	We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and money market lines of credit as well as redeem our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S3	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S4	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S5	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S6	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S7	The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S8	At December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S9	Senior Subordinated Notes Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S10	The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S11	We may redeem some or all of our 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 at any time at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S12	We may redeem some or all of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P146_S13	Prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem some or all of these notes at a make-whole redemption price.
912750_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things:

912750_14_ITEM8_P148_S1	At December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_14_ITEM8_P149_S0	For the years ended December 31, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes for continuing operations consisted of the following:
912750_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	The provision for income taxes for each of the indicated years was different than the amount computed using the federal statutory rate ( 35% ) for the following reasons:
912750_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	At December 31, the components of our deferred tax asset (liability) were as follows:
912750_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion for federal income tax and $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for state income tax purposes, respectively, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	NOL carryforwards of $189 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_14_ITEM8_P152_S2	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $74 million of our various gross state NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P152_S3	To the extent not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2033.
912750_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had gross NOL carryforwards for international income tax purposes of approximately $17 million , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P153_S1	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize these NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P153_S2	As a result, valuation allowances were established for these items in 2005 and 2006.
912750_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P155_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing deferred tax assets.
912750_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	The change in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows at December 31:
912750_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012 , we recorded a $15 million and $25 million valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset in Malaysia, respectively, due to insufficient estimated future taxable income.
912750_14_ITEM8_P157_S1	Also in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012 , we recorded a valuation allowance related to insufficient estimated future domestic taxable income to fully utilize foreign tax credits of $114 million and $421 million , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	The foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is fully offset by a valuation allowance.
912750_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	In 2013, we released $2 million of state valuation allowances due to utilization of the related state NOLs.
912750_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	For the years ended December 31, our stock-based compensation consisted of the following:
912750_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we had approximately $116 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards.
912750_14_ITEM8_P160_S1	The full amount is expected to be recognized within five years .
912750_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	Equity awards consist of service-based and performance- or market-based restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
912750_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	Stock-based compensation classified as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors are currently granted under the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan (2011 Plan).
912750_14_ITEM8_P162_S1	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and a lattice-based model for our performance- and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	Compensation expense for equity awards is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting periods.
912750_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	Shares available for grant under our 2011 Plan are reduced by 1.87 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_14_ITEM8_P164_S1	At December 31, 2013 , we had approximately (1) 2.7 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing plan if all future awards under our 2011 Plan are stock options, or (2) 1.5 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing plan if all future awards under our 2011 Plan are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_14_ITEM8_P164_S2	Thus far, the majority of the awards under our 2011 Plan have been granted as restricted stock unit awards.
912750_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	At December 31, 2013 , our employees held approximately three million shares of non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	In addition, at December 31, 2013 , our employees held 0.7 million shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting criteria (substantially all of which are considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	We primarily utilize treasury shares when restricted stock is issued or restricted stock units vest.
912750_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	The table below provides information about restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the following years:

912750_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	We have granted stock options under several plans.
912750_14_ITEM8_P170_S1	Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_14_ITEM8_P170_S2	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
912750_14_ITEM8_P170_S3	We issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	The excess tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital and is calculated as the amount by which the tax deduction we receive exceeds the deferred tax asset associated with recorded stock-based compensation expense.
912750_14_ITEM8_P171_S1	We did not realize an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation for 2013 , 2012 or 2011 because we did not have sufficient taxable income to fully realize the deduction.
912750_14_ITEM8_P171_S2	At December 31, 2013 , we had unrecognized net operating losses of $102 million related to stock-based compensation.

912750_14_ITEM8_P219_S0	Our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year-end 2013 were 270 million barrels compared to 237 million barrels and 247 million barrels at year-end 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P219_S1	Our proved NGL reserves at year-end 2013 were 68 million barrels compared to 37 million barrels and 16 million barrels at year-end 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P219_S2	Our proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2013 were 1.6 Tcf compared to 1.8 Tcf and 2.3 Tcf year-end 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P219_S3	Liquids comprised about 55% , 48% and 40% of our proved reserves at year-end 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
912750_14_ITEM8_P220_S0	During 2013 , our proved reserves increased 96 MMBOE as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases of reserves in place) and revisions of previous estimates.
912750_14_ITEM8_P220_S1	We expect the majority of future reserve growth to be associated with infill drilling, extensions of current fields and new discoveries, as well as improved recovery operations and purchases of proved properties.
912750_14_ITEM8_P220_S2	The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future.
912750_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	We added 80 MMBOE of proved reserves through discoveries, extensions and other additions, and 2 MMBOE through purchases.
912750_14_ITEM8_P221_S1	Drilling additions related to our domestic resource plays constituted 98% of our additions.
912750_14_ITEM8_P221_S2	Of the drilling additions, 54 MMBOE were proved undeveloped additions and 17 million barrels were proved developed liquids reserves.
912750_14_ITEM8_P222_S0	Total proved reserve revisions in 2013 were a positive 14 MMBOE or 2% of the beginning of year proved reserves.
912750_14_ITEM8_P222_S1	They included a positive 10 MMBOE price revision which was primarily related to our onshore natural gas plays.
912750_14_ITEM8_P223_S0	In mature plays, dominated by infill drilling and where reserve growth cannot be classified as an extension or discovery, the change in reserves is captured as a revision.
912750_14_ITEM8_P223_S1	In 2013, our revisions associated with the development of existing fields were a positive 75 MMBOE.
912750_14_ITEM8_P223_S2	Our focus on developing our liquids assets resulted in the removal of 294 Bcf ( 49 MMBOE) of gas reserves because they will not be converted to developed status in the next five years.
912750_14_ITEM8_P223_S3	The remaining revisions are associated with development plan changes and well performance.
912750_14_ITEM8_P223_S4	In the Uinta Basin, a change to the gas and projected NGL yield resulted in a negative 14 MMBOE performance revision.
912750_14_ITEM8_P224_S0	In 2013 , we sold 1 MMBOE of proved reserves associated with non-strategic assets and acreage trades.
912750_14_ITEM8_P224_S1	In 2012 , we sold 30 MMBOE of proved reserves associated with non-strategic assets.
912750_14_ITEM8_P225_S0	The following table sets forth our total net proved reserves and our total net proved developed and undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2010 , 2011 , 2012 and 2013 and the changes in our total net proved reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 :

912750_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	the Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and 2.
912750_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	There are many factors that may affect Newfield s business and results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Described below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should carefully consider, in addition to the other information contained in this report, the risks described below.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Oil, gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth, as well as liquidity and ability to access additional sources of capital, depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, gas and NGLs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Sustained lower prices will reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Oil, natural gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The markets for oil, gas and NGLs have historically been, and will likely remain, volatile.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	For example, record high U.S. crude oil production has contributed to global oil supply exceeding demand, which has caused crude oil prices to drop precipitously since September 2014.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The price of crude oil (WTI) in January 2015 averaged approximately $47 per barrel, as compared to approximately $95 per barrel in January 2014.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Natural gas prices also experienced significant volatility during 2014, as the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu (the highest price since December 2008) to a low of $2.89 per MMBtu (on the last trading day of the year).
912750_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulation.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	While we cannot predict whether or for how long commodity prices will remain at this level or decline further, we have made adjustments in response to the current strong supply and soft demand, such as modifying our 2015 capital investment plan based on commodity prices, drilling success, and markets for our products.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These adjustments are likely to influence our profitability and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition, our stock price in the market is influenced by oil and gas price movements.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Sustained material declines in crude oil, natural gas or NGL prices may have the following effects on our business:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	limit our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt; cause us to delay or postpone capital projects; cause us to lose certain leases because we fail to develop the leases prior to expiration; reduce reserves and the amount of products we can economically produce; reduce revenues, income and cash flows; or reduce the carrying value of our assets in our balance sheet through ceiling test impairments.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that could be greater than cash flows from operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We anticipate that our 2015 capital investment levels will approximate our cash flows from operations (inclusive of realized derivative contract gains and losses).
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We expect to use available capacity under our credit arrangements to fund any shortfall.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our ability to generate operating cash flows is subject to many risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells; prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs; our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, the extent to which properties are acquired and the promulgation of new regulatory requirements.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	We may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected, if:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	we are unable to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital; one or more of the lenders under our existing credit arrangements fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us; investors limit funding or refrain from funding fossil fuel companies; our customers or working interest owners default on their obligations to us; or we are unable to sell non-strategic assets at acceptable prices due to low commodity prices.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Estimating accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs is complex and inexact.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The process relies on interpretations of geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The extent, quality and reliability of these data can vary.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the effect of government regulation, taxes and availability of funds.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and our expected development plan; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on our prepared estimates.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil, natural gas and NGL prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on SEC 12-month average pricing, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year-end discounted at 10%.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used as of the date of an estimate.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, the decline in our reserves will eventually result in a decrease in gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Future natural gas and oil production is, therefore, highly dependent on our success in efficiently finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and based upon current commodity prices, will result in future ceiling test writedowns or other impairments.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders' equity in the period of occurrence.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	We evaluate the ceiling test quarterly and had our last ceiling test writedown of approximately $1.5 billion ($948 million, after tax) at December 31, 2012.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	We did not have a ceiling test writedown in 2013 or 2014; however, due to the substantial decline of commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2014, which has continued so far during the first quarter of 2015, we anticipate that we will have a ceiling test writedown during the first quarter of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, we believe that an impairment in the first quarter of 2015 could exceed $750 million.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The risk that we will be required to further writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Drilling is a high-risk activity .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or gas is present or may be produced economically.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	availability, costs and terms of contractual arrangements, such as leases, pipelines and related facilities to gather, process and compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; and compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Future drilling activities may not be successful, and if unsuccessful, this could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	environmental costs and liabilities due to our use, generation, handling and disposal of materials, including wastes, hydrocarbons and other chemicals; and environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If any of these risks occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	investigatory and clean-up responsibilities; regulatory investigation and penalties or lawsuits; limitation on or suspension of our operations; and repairs to resume operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Further, offshore operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoons or other adverse weather conditions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our China operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and in turn, our results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In connection with our operations, we generally require our contractors, which include the contractor, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliate companies, its subcontractors, their agents, employees, directors and officers, to agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees, contractors, subcontractors, agents and directors, and any property damage suffered by the contractors.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	While we maintain insurance against some potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The occurrence of any of the foregoing events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage or not indemnified, could reduce revenue and the funds available to us for our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulation.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental, habitat and other governmental regulations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Matters subject to regulation include the following, in addition to the other matters discussed under the caption Regulation in Items 1 and 2 of this report:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource risk mitigation, damages and other environmental or habitat damages.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We also could be required to install and operate expensive pollution controls, engage in environmental risk management and derivative activities or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Further, changes to existing environmental regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us, the oil and gas industry generally, our suppliers or our customers.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	For example, governments around the world have become increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and addressing the impacts of climate change in some manner.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In the absence of dedicated federal legislation on climate change mitigation or adaptation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated several rulemakings to regulate, measure or monitor GHG emissions under the existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, or CAA.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, as well as from certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities on an annual basis.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The new regulations could impact certain facilities in which we have interests (legal, equitable, operated or non-operated) by increasing regulatory risks and reporting requirements.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the CAA concluding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere from motor vehicles threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The finding, once made, required the EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions from new cars and light trucks under the CAA.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Indirectly, the EPA argued that it also triggered an EPA obligation to regulate GHG emissions under existing relevant air permitting programs for large stationary sources.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	On January 2, 2011, the EPA initiated Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting requirements for carbon dioxide and other GHGs from large and modified stationary sources.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Permits limiting GHGs have been issued for a variety of new or modified facilities under the Clean Air Act PSD program.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	GHG emissions also trigger Title V operating permit requirements for new and existing sources that exceed certain established emission thresholds.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Emission levels in excess of these thresholds can then trigger preconstruction permit requirements and application of best available control technology (BACT) or operation consistent with the lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) as determined on a source-by-source basis.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In June 2014, the Supreme Court upheld most of the EPA s GHG permitting requirements, allowing the agency to regulate the emission of GHGs from stationary sources already subject to the Clean Air Act s prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and Title V requirements.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Certain of our equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the Supreme Court s ruling, also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHGs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	For any equipment or installation so subject, we may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture GHGs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The EPA took additional action under the Clean Air Act in June 2014.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In accordance with the President of the United States' Climate Action Plan, on June 18, 2014, the EPA proposed rules to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The proposal, commonly called the Clean Power Plan, requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired generating units, commencing in 2020, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Under the proposal, each state would be given a different carbon reduction target, but the EPA expects that, in the aggregate, the overall proposal will reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units by 30% from 2005 levels.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	As proposed, states are given great flexibility in meeting their emission reduction targets, and can generally choose to lower carbon emissions by replacing higher carbon generation, such as coal or natural gas, with lower carbon generation, such as efficient natural gas units, renewable or end-use energy efficiency.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	It is not possible at this time to predict what requirements might be adopted by the EPA in the final rule, expected in 2015, or how any such final rule would impact our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Recently, the President of the United States announced that the EPA would propose by mid-2015, a new series of regulations to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 2025 by about 40 to 45% from 2012 levels.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These rules are in addition to a series of recent EPA oil and gas rules designed to curb volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from natural gas wells and related equipment, such as storage vessels and glycol dehydrators.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If the U.S. Congress adopts market-based tax, energy or other mechanisms to regulate the carbon intensity of natural resources, or promote or require the reduction of GHG emissions from certain industrial sectors, such legislation, depending on design and scope, could increase the cost of oil and gas production and market demand.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	including a low carbon fuel standard and cap-and-trade market applicable to, among others, electric utilities and transportation fuels.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Further, the U.S. Congress has previously proposed legislation that would directly impact our industry.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In response to the 2010 Macondo incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Congress considered a number of legislative proposals relating to the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and offshore that could result in significant additional laws or regulations governing our operations in the United States, including a proposal to raise or eliminate the cap on liability for oil spill cleanups under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Some federal agencies are adopting new rules governing hydraulic fracturing on leased federal or tribal trust lands.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Meanwhile, states, tribes and municipalities across the country have issued moratoria banning hydraulic fracturing.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	While we cannot predict how these rules will impact our business, they will likely increase costs or otherwise limit where we may conduct exploration and production activities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In December 2014, the Council on Environmental Quality issued draft guidance on consideration of climate change in project reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
912750_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We do not know whether and when this guidance may become final, nor can we predict its likely impact on our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	It is possible, however, that closer consideration of climate change may require BLM or other federal agencies to require enhanced environmental protections, at increased costs to operations like ours, at hydraulic fracturing sites across the country.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	These and other potential legislative proposals, along with any applicable legislation introduced and passed in Congress, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	See also - The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other hydrocarbon products that we produce.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand or other proppant materials, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Certain municipalities have already banned hydraulic fracturing, and courts have upheld those moratoria in some instances.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In the past several years, dozens of states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT) and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process, and the RCT promulgated rules regarding the same in December 2011.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	On September 11, 2012, the RCT approved new regulations relating to the commercial recycling of produced water and/or hydraulic-fracturing flowback fluid.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, in May 2013 the RCT adopted amendments to Statewide Rule 13 governing casing, cementing, well control and completion of oil and gas wells; these new construction requirements took effect on January 1, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	For example, on June 30, 2014, New York s highest state court upheld local zoning ordinances that ban hydraulic fracturing within municipal limits.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In the event state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Depending on the areas in which they are adopted, such restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In addition, on July 3, 2014, major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a causal connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	This study may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If such new laws or rules are adopted, our operations may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The EPA is also developing a proposed rule to amend the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Oil and Gas Extraction Category.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The proposed rule is scheduled for publication in 2015.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	It is unclear what the proposed rule will require, but with potential future limits on deep well injection, these limits may become increasingly important, as extraction and production companies look to dispose of wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works or centralized waste treaters.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	If deep well injection is shut down or limited, and discharge to surface waters is impossible, we may face increased disposal costs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In recent years, the federal government has increased its focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The White House Council on Environmental Quality has coordinated an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices involving the use of diesel fuel.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuels under the Safe Drinking Water Act and in February 2014 issued permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Further, on May 19, 2014, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to the disclosure of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Depending on the precise disclosure requirements the EPA elects to impose, if any, we may be obliged to disclose valuable proprietary information, and failure to do so may subject us to penalties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, in May 2013, the Bureau of Land Management issued a proposed rule that would require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, set requirements for well-bore integrity and establish flowback water standards for all hydraulic fracturing operations on federal public lands and American Indian Tribal lands.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The proposed rule also required that an operator certify, in writing, that (a) the stimulation design complies with all federal, state, tribal and local regulations; (b) the stimulation was completed in accordance with the design approved by BLM and all applicable regulations; and (c) the well-bore integrity was maintained during the fracturing process and flowback water was properly stored, treated and disposed.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, with draft results to be issued in 2015 for public comment and peer review.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has conducted an investigation into practices to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	In a November 18, 2011 report, the Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board issued 20 recommendations to federal agencies, states and private entities that are intended to reduce the environmental impact and assure the safety of shale gas production.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The U.S. Department of Energy continues to work with other federal agencies to identify best practices for shale gas production.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Some of these may become enforceable statutory or regulatory requirements that would likely increase our compliance costs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Given the heightened awareness regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing, it is possible that regulatory agencies or private parties may suggest that hydraulic fracturing has caused groundwater or surface water contamination, whether or not such allegations are accurate.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	For example, on December 8, 2011, the EPA released a preliminary report indicating that hydraulic fracturing is responsible for groundwater contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, although the EPA s draft report has been vigorously criticized as ignoring certain facts and utilizing incorrect data.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, the EPA alleged in an enforcement action against an operator in Texas that the operator contaminated local groundwater wells, although the RCT found after an evidentiary hearing that the operator was not responsible for the contamination.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P70_S3	However, in 2013 the EPA deferred the Pavillion matter to state oversight and withdrew the emergency action order in Texas.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Nevertheless, energy extraction, with a focus on onshore natural gas production, remains an EPA enforcement initiative.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	alleging groundwater contamination linked to hydraulic fracturing could trigger defense costs in administrative or civil litigation or proceedings to rebut the allegations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Additionally, certain members of the Congress have called upon (a) the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, (b) the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and (c) the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Further, on August 16, 2012, the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Specifically, the EPA finalized rules under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The EPA regulations include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically-fractured gas wells.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Since January 1, 2015, operators must capture the gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The standards are applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Further, the regulations under NESHAPS include specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	EPA has revised this rule two times, in September 2013 and December 2014.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P74_S3	We have and continue to evaluate the effect of these regulations, including the latest revisions, on our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Compliance with such regulations could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for us and our customers which may adversely impact our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds and other institutions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P76_S2	In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P76_S4	We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative contracts and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P76_S5	In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our use of oil and natural gas price derivative contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	As part of our risk management program, we generally use derivative contracts to protect a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P77_S3	A significant portion of our crude oil derivative contracts include short puts.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P77_S4	If market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the difference between our floors or swaps and the associated sold puts, effectively limiting the downside protection of these contracts.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In the case of acquisitions, we may use derivative contracts to protect acquired production from commodity price volatility for a longer period.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the relevant underlying commodity reference prices and those of our physical pricing points.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	While the use of derivative contracts may limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the volume subject to derivative contracts or there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the derivative transactions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The use of derivative transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to perform their financial and other obligations under such transactions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	result in an economic loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, and swaps market participants, such as Newfield.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain swaps to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, unless an exception from mandatory clearing is available, and if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, and that market participants post margin for uncleared swaps.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The CEA provides that non-financial entity end-users, such as Newfield, that enter into swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk may elect an exception from the mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	However, unless an exemption from the Dodd-Frank Act s margin requirements is available, our derivative transactions could be subject to higher costs due to margin payments to swap counterparties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P83_S2	While we do not expect that we will be required to post margin for uncleared swaps, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has not yet finalized the margin rules.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Therefore, we are unable to determine the future costs on our derivative activities at this time.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Higher costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Act can create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risks, including market price fluctuations associated with anticipated production of oil and gas.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations promulgated by CFTC could potentially increase the cost of Newfield s risk management activities, which could adversely affect our available liquidity, materially alter the terms of our swap contracts, reduce the availability of swaps to hedge or mitigate risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing swap contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, including by becoming more volatile and less predictable, which also could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P84_S3	It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	In December 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules to amend the CEA to establish position limits for certain commodity futures and options contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, including on commodity derivative transactions in which we engage in beyond certain thresholds.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	If the CFTC position limit regulations are ultimately adopted substantially in the form proposed, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Until the CFTC adopts final rules with respect to position limits and any exemptions for bona fide derivative transactions or off-setting positions from those limits, we will be unable to determine whether the CFTC s proposed rules could result in additional derivative costs or adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on the leases or units containing the leasehold acreage.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Leases on oil and gas properties normally have a term of three to five years and will expire unless, prior to expiration of the lease term, production in paying quantities is established.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	If the leases expire and we are unable to renew them, we will lose the right to develop the related properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P86_S3	The risk of the foregoing increases in periods of sustained low commodity prices due to the corresponding impact on our drilling plans and the likely decrease in what is considered economic production under the leases.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P86_S4	Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including commodity prices, drilling results, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P87_S2	These changes include, among other proposals:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	These proposals were also included in the President of the United States' Proposed Fiscal Year 2014 Budget.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P89_S2	The passage of such legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. Federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P91_S3	New regulations on the transportation of crude oil by rail, like those issued via emergency orders by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2014, may increase our transportation costs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P91_S4	In addition, federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, infrastructure or capacity constraints and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We have risks associated with our China operations .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Ownership of property interests and production operations in China are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental entity because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over our China operations; and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our China operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our China operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation, investment and transparency issues.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P95_S1	In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our China operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from our Pearl development project in China.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our Pearl facility in the South China Sea is a large, offshore development project.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The completion of our drilling in this project may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of this project include the following: project approvals by our joint-venture partner(s); timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals; weather conditions; availability of personnel; civil and political environment in China; and manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to our Pearl development and could have a material adverse effect on our expected timing and amount of cash flows from China and international results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Competition for, or the loss of, our senior management or experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel and the loss of any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a seasoned management team and experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Competition for these professionals remains strong.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P99_S4	If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P99_S5	We are likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and retain these professionals.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Our competitors include multinational oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S4	In addition, high commodity prices and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S5	We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S6	Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S7	As a consequence, our competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P100_S8	If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified field personnel could adversely affect financial condition and results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment as demand for that equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P102_S2	These factors have caused significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P102_S3	Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Similarly, lower crude oil and natural gas prices generally result in a decline in service costs due to reduced demand for drilling and completion services.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P102_S5	If the current market changes, and commodity prices quickly recover, we may face shortages of field personnel, drilling rigs, or other equipment or supplies, which could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or restrict operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Development activities require the use of water.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	For example, the hydraulic fracturing process that we employ to produce commercial quantities of natural gas and oil from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water in addition to the water we use to develop our waterflood in the GMBU.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	In these cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the operating cost.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations, such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas and oil.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P105_S4	In recent history, public concern surrounding increased seismicity has heightened focus on our industry's use of water in operations, which may cause increased costs, regulations or environmental initiatives impacting our use or disposal of water.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S2	See also - The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S4	We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S5	Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S6	Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S7	Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P106_S8	We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability and other coverages.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution and other environmental issues, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P107_S2	For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).
912750_15_ITEM1A_P107_S3	In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P110_S1	No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P110_S2	If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and divestitures .
912750_15_ITEM1A_P111_S1	As part of our business strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make acquisitions of properties and to divest non-strategic assets.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P111_S2	Suitable acquisition properties or suitable buyers of our non-strategic assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P112_S1	These risks include that the acquired properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flows at anticipated levels.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Also, the integration of properties we acquire could be difficult.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	greater financial and other resources to acquire properties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P113_S1	The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	recoverable reserves; exploration potential; future oil and gas prices and their appropriate differentials; operating costs and production taxes; and potential environmental and other liabilities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	These assessments are complex and the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P115_S1	In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P115_S2	Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P116_S0	In addition, our divestitures may pose residual risks to the Company, such as divestitures where we retain certain liabilities or we have legal successor liability due to the bankruptcy or dissolution of the purchaser.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Uneconomic or unsuccessful acquisitions and divestitures may divert management s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S1	We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S2	In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S3	We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S4	Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S5	It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S6	We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any cyber incidents or interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse or destruction of proprietary or other information, or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P118_S7	As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P119_S1	We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P120_S2	Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P121_S1	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P121_S3	Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P122_S0	A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P123_S0	We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P124_S0	adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P125_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $2.9 billion, including $0.4 billion in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P125_S2	The indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P126_S0	effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P127_S0	These restrictions and our level of indebtedness could limit our ability to:
912750_15_ITEM1A_P128_S0	obtain future financing; make needed capital expenditures; plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; compete with similar companies that have less debt; withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general; or conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P129_S1	Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions, and to comply with other covenants and restrictions in our financing agreements, can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P129_S2	Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these obligations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P129_S3	This failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions, even if sufficient funds were available.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P130_S1	If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P130_S2	If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, or repay such debt with the proceeds from a sale of assets or a public offering of securities.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P130_S3	Factors that will affect our ability to successfully complete a public offering, refinance our debt or conduct an asset sale include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P130_S4	We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our Company.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P132_S0	bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to affect a change of control of our Company, to acquire us or to replace incumbent management.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P132_S1	In addition, our change of control severance plan and agreements and our omnibus stock plans contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, upon a change of control.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
912750_15_ITEM1A_P133_S1	These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, or could reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of our Company.
912750_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	Between February and December 2013, we voluntarily self-disclosed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certain potential federal air quality violations at our facilities located on state lands and on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in the Uinta Basin of northeast Utah.
912750_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The self-disclosures were made after a voluntary internal environmental audit under the EPA's Self-Disclosure and Audit Policy.
912750_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	The potential violations related primarily to certain stationary internal combustion engines that are subject to certain air quality performance standards under 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart JJJJ.
912750_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	The engines were installed as a result of our efforts to replace older, higher-emitting engines with new, lower-emitting engines.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	Subpart JJJJ requires us to conduct certain emission performance tests within a defined time period.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	We did not conduct all of the requisite tests on the new engines in a timely fashion and have now negotiated a settlement and resolution with the EPA by entering in to a Combined Complaint and Consent Agreement and Compliance Order on Consent.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	Those settlement documents require us to pay a monetary penalty of $246,000 and conduct testing for numerous engines.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	The settlement documentation was finalized on October 20, 2014 and the penalty was paid timely on November 7, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S4	The required performance testing is ongoing and we anticipate that work to be completed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of the settlement.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S5	The violations did not contain any allegations of environmental spills, releases or pollution above permitted levels.
912750_15_ITEM3_P2_S6	We do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	In early 2012, through a voluntary environmental audit, we discovered potential violations of section 404 of the Clean Water Act relating to possible unpermitted discharges of fill materials into certain wetlands and drainages in the Uinta Basin.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	The potential violations were discovered on certain Newfield locations and several locations acquired in 2011.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	In June 2012, we self-disclosed these potential violations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), in accordance with the EPA s Audit Policy and an interagency memorandum of understanding with the Corps.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S3	The Corps initially indicated to us that it would not pursue penalty charges, but instead would work with us to restore the unpermitted discharges and acquire the appropriate after-the-fact permits.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S4	The EPA later inquired with the Corps, and was informed about the potential violations.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S5	Thereafter, the EPA initiated an administrative enforcement action against Newfield.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S6	The EPA has evaluated the discharges and our proposed restoration and mitigation, and a negotiated settlement has been finalized.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S7	On November 13, 2014, Newfield entered into an Administrative Order on Consent and a Combined Complaint and Consent Agreement to settle the matter.
912750_15_ITEM3_P3_S8	The EPA executed both agreements on December 17, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	The EPA published the notice of the Combined Complaint and Consent Agreement on December 17, 2014, for a 40-day comment period.
912750_15_ITEM3_P4_S1	No comments were received by the EPA.
912750_15_ITEM3_P4_S2	The settlement terms involved payment of a $175,000 penalty, restoration of much of the unpermitted discharges and off-site mitigation.
912750_15_ITEM3_P4_S3	The EPA issued the Final Order together with the fully executed Combined Complaint and Consent Agreement on January 27, 2015.
912750_15_ITEM3_P4_S4	The penalty will be paid before February 27, 2015 and the remediation and mitigation work will begin in 2015.
912750_15_ITEM3_P4_S5	We do not expect this administrative settlement to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_15_ITEM3_P5_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM3_P5_S2	In addition, from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate related to alleged violations of environmental statutes or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
912750_15_ITEM3_P5_S3	We cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines or penalties, or if such fines or penalties are imposed, that they would individually or in the aggregate exceed $100,000.
912750_15_ITEM3_P5_S4	If any fines or penalties are in fact imposed that are greater than $100,000, then we will disclose such fact in our subsequent filings.

912750_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table shows selected consolidated financial data derived from our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data should be read in conjunction with Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.
912750_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	_________________ (1) Continuing operations only (excludes Malaysia).
912750_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
912750_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our principal areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains and onshore Gulf Coast regions of the United States.
912750_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Internationally, we have offshore oil developments in China.
912750_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced.
912750_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and affect:
912750_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Crude oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014 and have remained low into the first quarter of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Nevertheless, we had many operational, financial and strategic successes in 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	As a result, we believe we are better positioned to face the challenges of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Building on the results of 2014, we have adapted our 2015 business plan to focus on the following goals in response to this period of dramatic oil and natural gas price declines:
912750_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	implement a plan to reduce domestic per unit lease operating costs by approximately 5 to 15%.
912750_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	While we expect to achieve savings from cost reductions during 2015, given the lower oil and natural gas price environment as compared to 2014, our revenues and operating income are expected to be lower in 2015 as compared to 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	During the second quarter of 2013, our businesses in Malaysia and China met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	In February 2014, Newfield International Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the sale of our Malaysia business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad, a Malaysian public company, for $898 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the sale of our Malaysia business.
912750_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	During 2014, we continued to market our China business with bids due December 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Due to the precipitous decline in oil prices in the fourth quarter, we were unable to sell our China business at an acceptable price and determined it was in the Company's best interest to retain the cash flow from the China business.
912750_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Accordingly, we reclassified this business as continuing operations for all periods presented.
912750_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our continuing operations consist of exploration, development and production activities in the United States and China.
912750_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The production and average realized prices tables below include our Gulf of Mexico operations for 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	In the 2012 discussion below, we excluded revenue of $116 million and production of 2,369 MBOE related to our Gulf of Mexico assets that were fully divested in the fourth quarter of 2012 in order to provide a more comparable analysis of our continuing operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Revenues from domestic operations of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 26% higher than 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase was primarily due to a 38% year-over-year increase in our liquids production.
912750_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	Increased oil production generated approximately 81% of the total revenue increase due to production increases in our Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains regions of 51%, 26% and 26%, respectively.
912750_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	The increase related to higher oil production was partially offset by lower oil prices, which reduced the overall oil volume and price impact to 58% of the total revenue growth.
912750_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	Increased NGL production in the Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains regions of 67%, 44% and 35%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014 generated approximately 20% of the total revenue increase.
912750_15_ITEM7_P10_S5	Approximately 18% of the total revenue increase was due to higher natural gas prices received during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenues from domestic operations of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 32% higher than 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase was primarily due to higher liquids production and commodity prices in 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Our liquids production increased 43% year-over-year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	As expected, our natural gas production declined as we continued to focus capital investments on higher-margin liquids production.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	Approximately 58% of the revenue increase in 2013 was attributable to increases in oil production in our Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains regions of 47%, 59% and 18%, respectively.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	Higher realized oil prices also increased revenues along with this favorable volume variance.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	Additionally, revenues increased 21% due to year-over-year NGL production increases in the Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains regions of 180%, 59% and 23%, respectively, partially offset by lower NGL prices.
912750_15_ITEM7_P11_S7	While natural gas production declined 14% in 2013, a 29% increase in the realized price during the period more than offset the negative production impact on revenue.
912750_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our China revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into floating storage facilities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	As a result, the timing of liftings may impact period-to-period results.
912750_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenues from China of $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 43% lower than 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the temporary shut-in of production in Bohai Bay by the operator during the second and third quarters of 2014 for scheduled repair and maintenance activities, along with a 24% decrease in oil price during 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Revenues from China of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 20% lower than 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The decrease was primarily due to 18% lower production and slightly lower commodity prices.
912750_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	The following table reflects our production from continuing operations and average realized commodity prices:
912750_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	_________________ (2) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	(3) We had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production or our production associated with our international operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	Had we included the realized effects of derivative contracts, the domestic average realized prices would have been as follows:
912750_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, production from domestic operations increased 20% primarily due to increased liquids production.
912750_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our total 2014 domestic liquids production increased 38% over the prior year due to the success of our liquids-focused drilling programs.
912750_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Almost 60% of the increase in total liquids was attributable to higher margin crude oil.
912750_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	Natural gas production increased 2% due to associated gas production generated by our liquids-focused drilling programs.
912750_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, production from domestic operations increased 7% over the prior year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Crude oil and NGL production increased 43% in 2013 but was partially offset by decreases in natural gas production across our domestic regions.
912750_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	The decrease in natural gas production was due to natural decline as a result of reduced investment in natural gas wells.
912750_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	More than half of the increase in total liquids in 2013 was attributable to higher margin crude oil.
912750_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	August 2014 for scheduled repairs and maintenance activities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Production resumed in August 2014; however, we had not accumulated sufficient quantities to schedule a lifting during the remainder of the year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Liftings from Bohai Bay are expected to resume in the first quarter of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	The decrease in liftings from Bohai Bay was partially offset by the first lifting from our Pearl development in December 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	Our Pearl development achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2014 after the repaired LF-7 topside facilities were installed in August 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, production from China decreased 18% compared to the same period in 2012 due to natural production decline combined with no wells drilled in the last nine months of the year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table presents information about operating expenses for our continuing operations:
912750_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, total operating expenses per BOE for domestic operations increased 2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The primary reasons for the change follow:
912750_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Lease operating expenses decreased 7% on a per BOE basis.
912750_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Higher production volumes, coupled with flat year-over-year well repair costs in all areas, generated approximately 60% of the per BOE reduction.
912750_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The remaining decrease relates primarily to successful water and compression cost management initiatives in our Williston Basin, Mid-Continent and onshore Gulf Coast areas.
912750_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Transportation and processing expense increased 6% on a per BOE basis primarily due to a 59% increase in NGL volumes processed during 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Production and other taxes as a percent of revenue increased 1%.
912750_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Approximately one-half of this increase is the result of higher tax incentives as well as an ad valorem tax true-up in 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	The remaining increase, on a percent of revenue basis, is primarily due to the significant growth of our Williston Basin production, which is subject to a higher production tax rate.
912750_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	On a per BOE basis, the increase is driven by increased liquids production as a percent of total production, and the associated increase in average revenue per BOE produced from $45.91 for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $48.41 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Total depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) increased 28% primarily due to the 20% increase in production volumes in 2014 compared to 2013, combined with a 7% increase in the cost per unit of production.
912750_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The increased cost per unit of production is primarily due to the transfer of approximately $760 million of unevaluated property costs into the full cost pool amortization base during the year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	The majority of the costs were transferred in the fourth quarter in response to the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting impact on our future development plans.
912750_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	General and administrative (G A) expense on a per BOE basis decreased 16% primarily due to increased production in 2014 as compared to 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	G A expense was flat year-over-year as increased employee-related expenses in 2014 were offset by higher capitalization of direct internal costs.
912750_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Employee-related expenses increased by $32 million for stock-based compensation, primarily due to our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program, which achieved three payout targets in 2014 compared to one in 2013 (see Note 11, "Stock-based Compensation," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report).
912750_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	The increase in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in labor-related costs associated primarily with the centralization of certain functions during the second half of 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we capitalized $135 million ($2.90 per BOE) of direct internal costs as compared to $107 million ($2.77 per BOE) during the comparable period of 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	This increase is primarily due to a higher portion of the costs associated with stock-based liability awards earned by employees who are directly involved with our exploration and development activities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Other operating expense increased $12 million primarily due to equipment inventory value impairments and legal settlements during 2014 as compared to 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, total operating expenses per BOE for our China operations increased 11% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Results for 2014 include activity from Bohai Bay and our Pearl development, whereas 2013 results include only Bohai Bay.
912750_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	LOE per barrel increased over 100% as a result of one-time production preparation costs associated with our Pearl development, a higher tariff on crude oil produced from our Pearl development and higher operating costs associated with deep water operations for Pearl.
912750_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	These increases were partially offset by a 37% decrease in production and other taxes per BOE, primarily due to the timing of liftings in China.
912750_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	Approximately 60% of our liftings in China were in the fourth quarter of 2014, which had significantly lower realized prices than 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We expect that 2015 revenues and expenses in China will increase over 2014 as we execute our Pearl development plan.
912750_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	In January 2015, we completed one well, and we plan to drill 4 additional wells during the year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Pearl development is expected to reach peak production by mid-2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses for our continuing operations:
912750_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, total operating expenses for domestic operations increased 7% but were flat on a per BOE basis after adjusting for the 2012 ceiling test writedown and operating expenses of $102 million attributable to Gulf of Mexico assets that were fully divested in the fourth quarter of 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The components of significant period-to-period change for operating expenses excluding Gulf of Mexico related expenses related to 2012 are as follows:
912750_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Lease operating expense decreased 2% on a per BOE basis primarily due to lower well repair costs in our Williston Basin, Mid-Continent and onshore Gulf Coast areas.
912750_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Transportation and processing expense increased 22% on a per BOE basis primarily due to increased NGL volumes as a percent of total production resulting from our liquids-focused drilling program.
912750_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Production and other taxes were flat on an actual cost and per unit basis.
912750_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	However, on a percent of revenue basis, they fell approximately 1%.
912750_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	This rate reduction is primarily attributable to production tax credits received in the Mid-Continent, onshore Gulf Coast and Uinta basins plus an $8 million adjustment of ad valorem taxes in the Uinta Basin previously expensed in 2012 and prior years.
912750_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	Without the ad valorem tax adjustment in the Uinta Basin, production and other taxes on a percent of revenue basis would have decreased by less than a half of a percent.
912750_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	General and administrative expense increased during 2013 primarily due to employee-related expenses associated with our Voluntary Severance Program and Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (see Note 11, "Stock-Based Compensation," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report), partially offset by the cost savings generated by the centralization of several administrative functions.
912750_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	During 2013, we capitalized $107 million ($2.77 per BOE) of direct internal costs as compared to $95 million ($2.45 per BOE) during 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.5 billion due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The primary reason for the change in value was negative price-related reserve revisions as a result of a 33% decrease in the natural gas SEC pricing.
912750_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Other expenses in 2012 of $15 million included a writedown of $8 million of subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets and contract termination costs of $6 million in consideration of other services.
912750_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, total operating expenses for China operations decreased by $9 million compared to the same period in 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	This overall decrease is consistent with the 18% decrease in production volumes in 2013 compared to 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the following years ended December 31:
912750_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Gross interest expense decreased slightly in 2014 as compared to 2013, due to the redemption of our 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 in October 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Gross interest expense remained flat in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the restructuring of our senior notes in 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	See Note 9, Debt , to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Interest expense associated with oil and gas properties excluded from amortization is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization was consistent for the first three quarters of 2014 resulting in flat capitalized interest in 2014 as compared to 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	We expect to see less capitalized interest in 2015 due to the reduction of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization at December 31, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	Capitalized interest decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012, due to a reduction in our average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization.
912750_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The fluctuations in commodity derivative income (expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding derivative contracts during these periods.
912750_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Commodity derivative income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $610 million, which was primarily comprised of unrealized gains of $649 million related to the change in value of derivative contracts due to changes in commodity prices, offset by $39 million of realized losses associated with derivative contract settlements.
912750_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Commodity derivative expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $97 million, which was primarily comprised of unrealized losses of $157 million related to the change in value of derivative contracts due to changes in commodity prices, offset by $60 million of realized gains associated with derivative contract settlements.
912750_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	See Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 8, "Fair Value Measurements," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were 37%, 64% and 33%, respectively.
912750_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	Our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to non-deductible expenses, state income taxes, the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates, and the impact of our China earnings being taxed both in the U.S and China.
912750_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	As a result of our earnings in China being taxed in both the U.S. and China, we expect our effective tax rate for future China earnings to be approximately 60%.
912750_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	We expect the U.S. portion of the rate to be a 35% tax rate, all of which is expected to be deferred taxes.
912750_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our effective tax rate for our domestic operations generally approximates 37%.
912750_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	For the year ended 2014, our effective tax rate was 37% for continuing operations as the majority of our income from continuing operations resulted from our domestic business, which was only taxable in the U.S.
912750_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	As a result of our December 2012 decision to repatriate earnings from our international operations, we experienced fluctuation in our effective tax rates in 2013 and 2012 due to these earnings being taxed both in the U.S. and the local countries.
912750_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Please see the discussion and tables in Note 10, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices; the timing, amount and location of future production; operating expenses; and capital costs.
912750_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our Malaysia revenues were primarily from the sale of crude oil.
912750_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore Malaysia operations was produced into FPSOs and "lifted" and sold periodically as barge quantities were accumulated.
912750_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Revenues were recorded when oil was lifted and sold, not when it was produced into FPSOs or onshore storage terminals.
912750_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	As a result, timing of liftings impacted period-to-period results.
912750_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	In February 2014, we closed the sale of our Malaysia business.
912750_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the sale.
912750_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from discontinued operations of $90 million were 89% lower than 2013, due to the sale of our Malaysia business in February 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Revenues of $823 million for 2013 were 18% lower than 2012, primarily due to fewer liftings of crude oil.
912750_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The average realized price per BOE remained essentially flat during 2012, 2013 and 2014 through the close date of the sale.
912750_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our 2013 total liftings decreased 18% as compared to 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P51_S4	Approximately 65% of the decrease in liftings was due to natural decline.
912750_15_ITEM7_P51_S5	The remainder of the decrease was due to the timing of liftings and the terms of the production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Malaysia, which reduced entitled production as we reached certain cost recovery milestones.
912750_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table reflects our production and average realized commodity prices from discontinued operations for each of the following years ended December 31:
912750_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	________________ (1) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following tables present information about our operating expenses for our discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our total operating expenses for discontinued operations for 2014 decreased $583 million compared to the same period of 2013 as a result of the sale of our Malaysia business in February 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our operating expenses for discontinued operations for 2013, stated on a per BOE basis, increased 29% over 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The components of the period-to-period change are as follows:
912750_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	LOE per BOE increased 41% ($4.50 per BOE) due to increased service costs related to offshore support operations in Malaysia and mostly-fixed fees associated with producing into onshore storage terminals in Malaysia combined with fewer liftings.
912750_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Production and other taxes per BOE increased 29% due to the terms of the PSCs in Malaysia, which increased production tax rates subsequent to reaching certain cost recovery milestones.
912750_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	DD A expense decreased 2% due to an 18% decrease in liftings during 2013 as compared to 2012, partially offset by an increase in the average DD A rate.
912750_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our DD A rate per BOE increased 19% in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to upward revisions of asset retirement costs in 2013 for Malaysia and the costs of unsuccessful wells in offshore Malaysia being included in costs subject to amortization in the second quarter of 2013 without a related increase in reserves.
912750_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	G A expense increased approximately $11 million ($1.56 per BOE) primarily due to increased employee-related costs and other costs associated with our decision to sell our Malaysia business.
912750_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following discussion is inclusive of both our continuing and discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.
912750_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	We accomplish this through drilling programs and property acquisitions, which require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	Sustained lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs will reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and will affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures.
912750_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Sustained lower commodity prices may also impact our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as further described below.
912750_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, as well as the available borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into the first quarter of 2015, crude oil prices declined significantly primarily due to global supply and demand imbalances.
912750_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Given the future uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of an eventual recovery of crude oil prices, we have reduced our planned capital spending for 2015 to more closely match our expected cash flows and have decided to optimize long-term liquidity preservation over short-term reserve and production growth.
912750_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	We expect our 2015 budget will be financed through our cash flows from operations (inclusive of realized derivative contract gains and losses) and borrowings under our credit facility, as needed.
912750_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	Approximately 82% of our expected 2015 domestic oil and gas sales (excluding NGLs) supporting the current 2015 capital budget are partially protected against oil and gas price volatility using derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM7_P64_S4	For further discussion of our derivative activities, see Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our 2015 capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and direct internal costs of approximately $120 million , is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.
912750_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the values of our U.S. and China cost center ceilings were calculated based upon SEC pricing of $ 4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas and $ 94.98 per barrel for oil.
912750_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Using these prices, our ceilings for the U.S. and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $400 million and $150 million , respectively, net of tax, and as such, no ceiling test writedown was required.
912750_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	Holding all other factors constant, it is likely that we will experience a ceiling test writedown in the U.S. and China in the first quarter of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes.
912750_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, we believe that an impairment in the first quarter of 2015 could exceed $750 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results; oil, natural gas and NGL prices; industry conditions; the prices and availability of goods and services; and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold.
912750_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.
912750_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances or fluctuations in our cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We continuously monitor our liquidity needs, coordinate our capital expenditure program with our expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluate our available alternative sources of liquidity, including accessing debt and equity capital markets in light of current and expected economic conditions.
912750_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	We believe that our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our operations will be adequate to fund 2015 operations and continue to meet our other obligations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Credit Arrangements and Other Financing Activities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	We maintain a revolving credit facility of $1.4 billion that matures in June 2018, as well as money market lines of credit of $195 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	At December 31, 2014 , we had $345 million of LIBOR based loans outstanding against our revolving credit facility and $101 million outstanding against our money market lines of credit.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	In October 2014, we completed the redemption of our $600 million aggregate principal of 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	The transaction included a premium payment of approximately $14 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S5	At December 31, 2014 , we had no scheduled maturities of senior or senior subordinated notes until 2020.
912750_15_ITEM7_P71_S6	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior and senior subordinated notes, please see Note 9, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and certain noncash items to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	We entered this challenging commodity price environment with strong debt covenant-related financial ratios and do not foresee this changing in 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements, please see Note 9, Debt , to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	As of February 20, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $610 million and available borrowing capacity of approximately $790 million under our revolving credit facility.
912750_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	In addition, we had outstanding borrowings under our money market lines of credit of $85 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners.
912750_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital.
912750_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had negative working capital of $161 million and $389 million, respectively.
912750_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	The changes in our working capital from 2013 to 2014 are primarily a result of a $485 million increase in the fair value of our current net derivative asset during 2014 combined with working capital reductions associated with the sale of our Malaysia business (February 2014) and our Granite Wash assets (September 2014).
912750_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	The remaining change is due to the timing of the collection of receivables; the timing of crude oil liftings in our China operations; drilling activities; payments made by us to vendors and other operators; and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our primary source of capital and liquidity are cash flows from operations, which are primarily affected by the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as commodity prices, net of the effects of settled derivative contracts, as well as changes in working capital.
912750_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our net cash flows from operations were approximately $1.4 billion in 2014 (includes $3 million of cash flows from our Malaysia discontinued operations), $1.4 billion in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012.
912750_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	Despite selling our Malaysia business, which provided approximately $249 million of our 2013 cash flows from operations, our 2014 cash flows from operations were relatively flat compared to 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	This is a result of increased domestic production, strong pricing during the first nine months of the year and a $0.42 per BOE decrease in domestic operating expenses (excluding non-cash DD A expense) during the year.
912750_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net cash used in investing activities for 2014 was $660 million compared to $2.1 billion for 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The decrease in net cash used in 2014 investing activities is primarily due to net proceeds of $809 million received from the sale of our Malaysia business and proceeds of approximately $620 million from the sale of our Granite Wash and other assets.
912750_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Our investment levels in our oil and gas properties were relatively consistent during 2014 and 2013 as we executed our plan in a stable commodity price environment into third quarter 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	Due to the dramatic commodity price decline in fourth quarter 2014, we expect a significant decrease in our investments during 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 was $808 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $620 million for 2013.
912750_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	During 2014, we reduced our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit by $203 million and redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal of 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 using the proceeds from the sale of our Granite Wash assets.
912750_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our capital investments for continuing operations for 2014 increased 5% compared to 2013, due to accelerating the development of our domestic assets during 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The table below summarizes our capital investments.
912750_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations due by year as of December 31, 2014 .
912750_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes assets and liabilities associated with our derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	For a discussion regarding our derivative contracts, see Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
912750_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	(2) Includes agreements for office space, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for office space and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	Given the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related impact on our 2015 planned capital investments as well as the potential impact on development plans in future years, we could fail to deliver the minimum production required under these commitments.
912750_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $1.83 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	_________________ (1) Our oil delivery commitments include commitments with Salt Lake City, Utah refiners.
912750_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Our delivery commitments are for approximately 18,000 barrels of oil per day through 2020 and an additional 20,000 barrels of oil per day expected to start in 2016 and continuing through 2025.
912750_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	The 20,000 barrel per day delivery commitment represents approximately 7,300 MBbls of our committed oil volumes for each of the years 2016 through 2025.
912750_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	The timing may change due to timing of the refinery expansion completion.
912750_15_ITEM7_P86_S4	These commitments relate to our Uinta Basin production.
912750_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis.
912750_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	We use derivative contracts to manage the variability in cash flows caused by commodity price fluctuations associated with our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24 to 36 months.
912750_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production or on production associated with our discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities" below and " Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices " in Item 7A of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	See the discussion and tables in Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 8, "Fair Value Measurements," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2014 .
912750_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Between January 1, 2015 and February 20, 2015, we did not enter into additional derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S4	We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S5	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_15_ITEM7_P95_S6	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories.
912750_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category.
912750_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method.
912750_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates:
912750_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties.
912750_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company.
912750_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions.
912750_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	Stock-based compensation costs require estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments.
912750_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules.
912750_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost.
912750_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment.
912750_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs.
912750_15_ITEM7_P102_S4	Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two-step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to see if an impairment is required.
912750_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	If required, the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward-looking prices.
912750_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	Impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using SEC pricing, costs in effect at year-end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on SEC pricing and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	Changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves.
912750_15_ITEM7_P106_S4	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	Estimated proved oil, gas and NGL reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DD A expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown.
912750_15_ITEM7_P107_S3	To change our diluted earnings per share for continuing operations by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2014 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.17 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 1%, or 6 MMBOE.
912750_15_ITEM7_P107_S4	Our China DD A rate would need to change by $1.24 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our China proved reserves of approximately 5%, or 1 MMBOE.
912750_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	The ceiling value of oil, gas and NGL reserves is calculated based on SEC pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the values of our U.S. and China cost center ceilings were calculated based upon SEC pricing of $ 4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas and $ 94.98 per barrel for oil.
912750_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	Using these prices, our ceilings for the U.S. and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $400 million and $150 million , respectively, net of tax, and as such, no ceiling test writedown was required.
912750_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	Holding all other factors constant, it is likely that we will experience a ceiling test writedown in the U.S. and China in the first quarter of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes.
912750_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, we believe that an impairment in the first quarter of 2015 could exceed $750 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	Further SEC pricing declines or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could result in additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods.
912750_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base.
912750_15_ITEM7_P114_S2	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_15_ITEM7_P114_S3	Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_15_ITEM7_P114_S4	If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.
912750_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and estimated future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization.
912750_15_ITEM7_P115_S1	To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled).
912750_15_ITEM7_P115_S2	Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work.
912750_15_ITEM7_P115_S3	Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated.
912750_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage.
912750_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we had a total of $ 677 million of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools, all of which related to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Inclusion of some or all of our domestic unevaluated property costs in our domestic full cost pool, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown as the after-tax impact would be less than our ceiling test cushion.
912750_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our gathering systems, production platforms and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_15_ITEM7_P117_S2	We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants.
912750_15_ITEM7_P117_S3	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates.
912750_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
912750_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_15_ITEM7_P120_S2	To change our diluted earnings per share for continuing operations by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2014 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.17 per BOE which would require a change in estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 2%, or $111 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P120_S3	Our China DD A rate would need to change by $1.24 per BOE which would require a change in estimate of our China future development and abandonment costs of approximately 104%, or $29 million.
912750_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	As part of our growth strategy, we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
912750_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date.
912750_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date.
912750_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as goodwill.
912750_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.
912750_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	The value allocated to recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above.
912750_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	The accounting standard for business combinations establishes how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
912750_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction.
912750_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	We do not designate future price-risk management activities as accounting hedges.
912750_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had net derivative assets of $613 million, of which 54%, based on total contracted volumes, was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black-Scholes) and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open derivative contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative.
912750_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, as well as other relevant economic measures.
912750_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the derivative contracts, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM7_P131_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility, as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_15_ITEM7_P131_S3	As a result, the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than the fair value as of December 31, 2014 .
912750_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	The determination of the fair value of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_15_ITEM7_P134_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_15_ITEM7_P134_S3	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units as well as a Stockholder Value Appreciation Program that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_15_ITEM7_P134_S4	See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
912750_15_ITEM7_P135_S1	The guidance applies prospectively to all entities, requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose certain information when substantial doubt is raised.
912750_15_ITEM7_P135_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
912750_15_ITEM7_P135_S3	We do not expect this guidance to impact our Company.
912750_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
912750_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	The guidance may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings.
912750_15_ITEM7_P136_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
912750_15_ITEM7_P136_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the reporting of discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date.
912750_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM7_P138_S1	We do not expect this guidance to impact our Company.
912750_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P139_S1	An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation.
912750_15_ITEM7_P139_S2	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM7_P139_S3	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_15_ITEM7_P139_S4	Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business, in Item 1A of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to enter into derivative contracts is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While the use of derivative contracts can limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In addition, the use of derivative contracts may involve basis risk.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	At December 31, 2014 , ten of our 16 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our contracted volumes with no single counterparty accounting for more than 15%.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Of our expected 2015 crude oil production, 87% is protected against price volatility through the use of derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Almost 90% of our crude oil derivative structures include short puts.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Short puts effectively limit our downward price protection below the weighted average of our short puts of $71.83 per barrel.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P3_S6	If the market price remains below $71.83 per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our short puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which average $18.19 per barrel.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We do not have any natural gas derivative contracts that include short puts.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see the information under the captions Oil and Gas Derivatives and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2014 , our debt was comprised of:
912750_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 85% of our obligations were at fixed rates as of December 31, 2014 , and our variable rate debt was at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 2%.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A 10% increase in LIBOR would not materially impact our interest costs on debt outstanding at December 31, 2014, but would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The functional currency for our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	To the extent that business transactions in a foreign country are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	We did not have any open derivative contracts related to foreign currencies at December 31, 2014 .
912750_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), the management of our Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014 .
912750_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newfield Exploration Company:
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_15_ITEM8_P6_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

912750_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
912750_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).
912750_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	Our principal domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and the onshore Gulf Coast regions of the United States.
912750_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	In addition, we have offshore oil developments in China.
912750_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to Newfield, we, us, our or the Company are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Our businesses in Malaysia and China were classified as held for sale in the second quarter of 2013.
912750_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , our China business is no longer held for sale, as we concluded the marketing process and were unable to sell at an acceptable price given the significant decrease in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Therefore, our China business is included in continuing operations for all periods in these financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P18_S3	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," for additional disclosures, as well as information regarding the sale of our Malaysia business, which closed in February 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	These financial statements and notes are inclusive of our Malaysia operations unless otherwise noted.
912750_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	It is possible for any of these effects to occur in the near term, given the recent decline in commodity pricing.
912750_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing impairment of our oil and gas properties.
912750_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
912750_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Our most significant estimates are associated with the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the timing and amount of transfers of our unevaluated properties into our amortizable full cost pool and the fair value of both our derivative positions and our stock-based compensation liability awards.
912750_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.
912750_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	These reclassifications did not impact our net income (loss), stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Substantially all of our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold at market-based prices to a variety of purchasers under short-term contracts (less than 12 months).
912750_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	We also have long-term contracts in the Uinta Basin at market-based prices, less a variable differential that becomes fixed below certain market price thresholds.
912750_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Revenues from the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Under the sales method, the Company and other joint owners may sell more or less than their entitled share of production.
912750_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Should the Company s excess sales exceed our share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves, a liability is recorded.
912750_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	Differences between sales and our entitled share of production are not significant.
912750_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	The functional currency for our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Other, net on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Restricted cash and the associated deferred liability on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 represent a deposit received in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to the sale of our Malaysia business.
912750_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Amounts were contractually restricted until the transaction closed in February 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," for further discussion about the close of the sale of the Malaysia business.
912750_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Investments consist of debt and equity securities, a majority of which are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value.
912750_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.
912750_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	We routinely assess material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.
912750_15_ITEM8_P32_S3	Generally, our oil and gas receivables are collected within 45 to 60 days of production.
912750_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated.
912750_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our international operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Tubular goods and well equipment inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	During 2014, we wrote down obsolete inventory across all three of our domestic regions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	At December 31, 2012, we wrote down subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	The writedowns of $ 9 million in 2014 and $ 8 million in 2012 are included in Operating expenses Other on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in China is produced into floating storage facilities and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	$ 8 million and $ 1 million , respectively, and is included under the caption "Inventories" on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Cost for purposes of the carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of related production costs and depletion expense.
912750_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations" for details on our Malaysia crude oil inventory.
912750_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	We capitalized approximately $199 million , $198 million and $191 million of interest and direct internal costs in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, we sold our Malaysia business, which constituted the entire full cost pool for Malaysia.
912750_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," for further discussion.
912750_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	A particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas and NGL prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period of time or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.98 per barrel for oil.
912750_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	Using these prices, our ceilings for the U.S. and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $400 million and $150 million , respectively, net of tax, and as such, no ceiling test writedown was required.
912750_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	The continued decline of SEC pricing for oil and natural gas reserves since December 31, 2014 will likely result in a ceiling test writedown in the first quarter of 2015.
912750_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.82 per barrel for oil.
912750_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Using these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our domestic and China full cost pools exceeded the net capitalized costs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2013 .
912750_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	At December 31, 2012 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.84 per barrel for oil.
912750_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.5 billion ( $948 million , after tax).
912750_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	No ceiling test writedown was required for the China full cost pool at December 31, 2012.
912750_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	See Note 4, Oil and Gas Assets, for a detailed discussion regarding our oil and gas asset acquisitions and sales transactions during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
912750_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Gathering systems and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 25 years.
912750_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the ARO is incurred.
912750_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Settlements include payments made to satisfy the AROs, as well as transfer of the AROs to purchasers of our divested properties.
912750_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will equal the estimated future costs to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for our Company.
912750_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds, and the original capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The change in our ARO for continuing operations for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	_________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, additions include $28 million for our Pearl development in offshore China and $30 million for abandonment obligations in our domestic business.
912750_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	(2) For the year ended December 31, 2014, settlements include $10 million related to the sale of our Granite Wash assets.
912750_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, settlements include $28 million related to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets.
912750_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	See Note 4, Oil and Gas Assets.
912750_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, liabilities and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
912750_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	We accrue for losses when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
912750_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, for a more detailed discussion regarding our contingencies.
912750_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed as incurred.
912750_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based upon evaluations of currently available facts related to each site.
912750_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did not accrue related interest or penalties.
912750_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	The tax years 2011-2014 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units as well as a Stockholder Value Appreciation Program that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_15_ITEM8_P59_S4	See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	Our joint interest owners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers.
912750_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	If the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general was adversely affected, the ability of our joint interest partners to reimburse us could be adversely affected.
912750_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The purchasers of our oil, gas and NGL production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market and are not typically subject to margin-deposit requirements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	We monitor the credit ratings of our hedging counterparties on an ongoing basis.
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S3	Although we have entered into derivative contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S4	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in hedging transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S5	At December 31, 2014 , ten of our 16 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our contracted volumes, with no single counterparty accounting for more than 15% .
912750_15_ITEM8_P63_S6	Approximately 40% of our volumes subject to derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility.
912750_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Tesoro Corporation and Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC accounted for 12% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues in 2014 .
912750_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	During 2013 , Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Tesoro Corporation accounted for 13% , 12% , and 11% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	During 2012 , sales of our oil and gas production to Royal Dutch Shell plc, Tesoro Corporation and Big West Oil LLC accounted for 14% , 14% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_15_ITEM8_P65_S3	We believe that the loss of any of our major customers would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are available.
912750_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Our derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.
912750_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	While we utilize our derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance.
912750_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities unless they are determined to have a significant financing element at inception, in which case they are classified within financing activities.
912750_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	See Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet accordingly.
912750_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	See Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," for details regarding the gross amounts, as well as the impact of our netting arrangements on our net derivative position.
912750_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	We only offset assets and liabilities in relation to our derivative financial instruments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	At December 31, 2012, accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) included unrealized losses related to auction rate securities that were deemed to be temporary as the Company had the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
912750_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company changed its intention and considered plans to sell the securities.
912750_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	As a result, the losses previously accumulated in AOCI related to these securities were transferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	During the first quarter of 2014, all auction rate securities were sold for $39 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	The change in AOCI for the indicated periods is set forth below:
912750_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
912750_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The guidance applies prospectively to all entities, requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose certain information when substantial doubt is raised.
912750_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
912750_15_ITEM8_P72_S3	We do not expect this guidance to impact our Company.
912750_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
912750_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	The guidance may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings.
912750_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
912750_15_ITEM8_P73_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the reporting of discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date.
912750_15_ITEM8_P74_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P74_S3	We do not expect this guidance to impact our Company.
912750_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income, less any applicable adjustments, (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (excluding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	Diluted EPS incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for the indicated years:
912750_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes 1.1 million and 4.0 million shares of unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units and stock options for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, because including the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	(2) The effect of unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units and stock options has not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2012, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	Had we recognized income from continuing operations for that year, incremental shares attributable to the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options would have increased diluted weighted-averages shares outstanding by 0.7 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2012.
912750_15_ITEM8_P78_S3	(3) The numerator includes an adjustment of $20 million related to the repurchase of preferred shares of a now wholly-owned subsidiary, which reduces net income (loss) for purposes of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_15_ITEM8_P78_S4	The subsidiary is part of our continuing operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P78_S5	See Note 16, "Related Party Transaction," for additional information.
912750_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	In 2013, we met the criteria to classify our Malaysia business as held-for-sale and discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	In February 2014, Newfield International Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the sale of our Malaysia business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad (SapuraKencana), a Malaysian public company, for $898 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	the sale, we recorded a gain in the first quarter of 2014 of approximately $388 million ( $252 million , after tax).
912750_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	As of the date of this report, the final post-close settlement is pending due to a dispute with the purchaser that arose subsequent to closing and could possibly go to arbitration.
912750_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an allowance against a receivable from SapuraKencana and reduced the previously recognized gain by $15 million ( $10 million , after tax) due to uncertainty associated with collectability.
912750_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	________________ (1) Certain payments to foreign governments made on our behalf that are part of the revenue process are recorded as a reduction of the related oil and gas revenues.
912750_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	Historically, our effective tax rate in Malaysia was approximately 38% .
912750_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	As a result of our December 2012 decision to repatriate earnings from our international operations, we experienced higher international effective tax rates due to these earnings being taxed both in the U.S. and the local country.
912750_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	For the year ended 2014, our effective tax rate in Malaysia was 37% as the majority of our income from discontinued operations resulted from the gain on the sale of our Malaysia business, which was only taxable in the U.S.
912750_15_ITEM8_P82_S3	The effective tax rate for our discontinued operations for the years ended 2013 and 2012 was 58% and 168% , respectively, due to our international earnings being taxed both in the U.S and the local country.
912750_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	At December 31, 2013, the crude oil inventory from our Malaysia operations consisted of approximately 1.1 million barrels of crude oil valued at cost of $89 million and is included in the "Inventories" line item in the preceding table and in our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	Cost for purposes of the carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of production costs and depletion expense.
912750_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	At December 31, 2013, we performed a fair value assessment of our discontinued operations, noting no indication of impairment based on the carrying value.
912750_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	During 2012, when our Malaysia business was reported as continuing operations, we performed a ceiling test for the full cost pool.
912750_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	The ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.84 per barrel for oil.
912750_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	Using these prices, the cost center ceiling with respect to our Malaysia full cost pool exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective cost center at December 31, 2012 and as such, no ceiling test writedown was required.
912750_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The change in our ARO for our discontinued operations for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	________________ (1) Obligations reduced as a result of the sale of our Malaysia business in February 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	Oil and gas properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which we own an interest.
912750_15_ITEM8_P89_S1	These unproved property costs include unevaluated leasehold acreage, geological and geophysical data costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, costs associated with wells in progress at year-end and capitalized internal costs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P89_S2	We exclude these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired.
912750_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant.
912750_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	Costs associated with wells in progress are transferred to the amortization base upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results.
912750_15_ITEM8_P90_S2	All other costs excluded from the amortization base are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred.
912750_15_ITEM8_P90_S3	The amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for international operations if a reserve base has not yet been established.
912750_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2014, crude oil and natural gas prices declined to price levels that are likely to change our future development plans in certain operating areas of our domestic business.
912750_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	Accordingly, we transferred approximately $760 million of costs that were previously withheld from the full cost pool into the full cost pool amortization base.
912750_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	Oil and gas properties not subject to amortization as of December 31, 2014, consisted of the following:
912750_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	In September 2014, we closed on the sale of our Granite Wash assets, located primarily in Texas, for approximately $588 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	The sale of our Granite Wash assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Granite Wash operations through the date of sale.
912750_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	In October 2012, we closed the sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W T Offshore, Inc. for approximately $208 million , subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of sale.
912750_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $33 million , $72 million and $9 million , respectively, and sold certain other oil and gas properties for proceeds of approximately $69 million , $36 million and $422 million , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_15_ITEM8_P95_S2	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	We utilize the following derivative strategies, which consist of either a single derivative instrument or a combination of instruments, to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our domestic oil and natural gas production.
912750_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	With respect to a swap position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price.
912750_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	Collars (combination of purchased put options (floor) and sold call options (ceiling)) .
912750_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	For a collar position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor strike price while we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling strike price.
912750_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor strike price and equal to or less than the ceiling strike price.
912750_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	A swap with a sold put position consists of a standard swap position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the associated fixed-price swap.
912750_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	This structure enables us to increase the fixed-price swap with the value received through the sale of the put.
912750_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the put strike price, then we will only receive the difference between the swap price and the put strike price.
912750_15_ITEM8_P99_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard swap only.
912750_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	A collar with a sold put position consists of a standard collar position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the floor strike price of the collar.
912750_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	This structure enables us to improve the collar strike prices with the value received through the sale of the additional put.
912750_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the additional put strike price, then we will receive the difference between the floor strike price and the additional put strike price.
912750_15_ITEM8_P100_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar only.
912750_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	A swaption is an option to exercise a swap where the buyer (counterparty) of the swaption purchases the right from the seller (Newfield), but not the obligation, to enter into a fixed-price swap with the seller on a predetermined date (expiration date).
912750_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	The swap price is a fixed price determined at the time of the swaption contract.
912750_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	If the swaption is exercised, the contract will become a swap treated consistent with our other fixed-price swaps.
912750_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	While the use of these derivative instruments may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk adjustments using credit default swaps, interest rates and time to maturity.
912750_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The calculation of the fair value of options requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	See Note 8, Fair Value Measurements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	At December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding derivative positions as set forth in the tables below.
912750_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	_________________ (1) During the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold natural gas swaption contracts that, if exercised on their expiration date in the second quarter of 2015, would protect 14,640 MMMBtus of calendar-year 2016 production from future commodity price volatility.
912750_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	These contracts give the counterparties the option to enter into swap contracts with us at $ 4.10 /MMBtu for calendar-year 2016.
912750_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	_________________ (1) If the market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the market price plus the following associated with our production:
912750_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	the difference between our swaps and our sold puts for fixed-price swaps with sold puts.
912750_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	(2) During the third quarter of 2014, we sold crude oil swaption contracts that, if exercised on their expiration date in the first quarter of 2015, would protect 732 MBbls of calendar-year 2016 production from future commodity price volatility.
912750_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	These contracts give the counterparties the option to enter into swap contracts with us at $ 91.00 /Bbl for calendar-year 2016.
912750_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in Commodity derivative income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	Reserve for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2014 includes an allowance for $15 million related to discontinued operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity fixed-price swaps and certain investments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as commodity options (i.e., price collars, sold puts or swaptions) and other financial investments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	Our valuation model for the Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP) is a Monte Carlo simulation that is based on a probability model and considers various inputs including: (a) the measurement date stock price, (b) time value and (c) historical and implied volatility.
912750_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, for a description of the SVAP.
912750_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
912750_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
912750_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The determination of the fair values above incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), if any.
912750_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties.
912750_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we held $39 million of auction rate securities, which were classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	During the first quarter of 2014, all auction rate securities were sold for $39 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods.
912750_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	________ (1) During the second quarter of 2014, we transferred $ 3 million of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 hierarchy.
912750_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	The transfer was a result of our Level 3 swaptions being exercised by the counterparties as swaps on May 30, 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we held $39 million of auction rate securities maturing beginning in 2033 that were classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	This amount reflected an other than temporary decrease in the fair value of these investments since the time of purchase of $6 million ( $4 million net of tax) recorded in 2013 under the caption "Other income (expense) Other, net" on our consolidated statement of operations as a result of our 2013 decision to liquidate our auction rate investments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P129_S2	During the first quarter of 2014, all auction rate securities were sold for $39 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	Our valuation models for Level 3 derivative option contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various factors, including certain significant unobservable inputs such as (a) volatility factors and (b) counterparty credit risk.
912750_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_15_ITEM8_P131_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the strike prices fixed by our derivative contracts, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the contractual life are discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_15_ITEM8_P131_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	Significant increases (decreases) in the quoted forward prices for commodities generally lead to corresponding decreases (increases) in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	Significant changes in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	See Note 5, "Derivative Financial Instruments," for additional discussion of our derivative instruments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors that include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).
912750_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	Historically, we have not experienced significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The calculation of the fair value of the SVAP liability requires the use of a probability-based Monte Carlo simulation, which includes unobservable inputs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P135_S1	The simulation predicts multiple scenarios of future stock returns over the performance period, which are discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_15_ITEM8_P135_S2	The fair value is recognized over a service period derived from the simulation.
912750_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	Future stock returns and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility.
912750_15_ITEM8_P136_S1	Significant increases (decreases) in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant increases (decreases) in the fair value measurement of the SVAP liability.
912750_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as of December 31, was as follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	Any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit are at variable rates as of the indicated dates and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	At December 31, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	_________________ (1) Because we have the ability and intent to use our available credit facility capacity to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations, if any, are classified as long-term.
912750_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	We have a revolving credit facility that matures in June 2018 and provides borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion .
912750_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 14% of total commitments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating ( 75 basis points per annum at December 31, 2014 ) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating ( 175 basis points per annum at December 31, 2014 ).
912750_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating ( 30 basis points per annum at December 31, 2014 ).
912750_15_ITEM8_P144_S1	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately $4 million , $3 million and $3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, which are recorded in Interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns and goodwill impairments) to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.

912750_15_ITEM8_P148_S2	If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_15_ITEM8_P148_S3	In addition, our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our derivative arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.

912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	In June 2012, we issued $1 billion of 5 % Senior Notes due 2024 and received proceeds of $990 million (net of offering costs).
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	These notes were issued at par to yield 5 %.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and money market lines of credit as well as redeem our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S3	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S4	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S5	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S6	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S7	The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S8	At December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S9	Senior Subordinated Notes In October 2014, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018.
912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S10	In connection with the redemption, we paid a premium of $14 million .

912750_15_ITEM8_P149_S12	In addition, unamortized offering costs of approximately $3 million were charged to interest expense as a result of the repayment.
912750_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	We may redeem some or all of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes.
912750_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_15_ITEM8_P150_S2	The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness.
912750_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things:
912750_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	engage in mergers; consolidations; and sales and other dispositions of assets.
912750_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	At December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	For the years ended December 31, income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	For the years ended December 31, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes for continuing operations consisted of the following:
912750_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes for continuing operations for the indicated years was different than the amount computed using the federal statutory rate ( 35% ) for the following reasons:
912750_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	In fourth quarter 2012, we made a decision to repatriate earnings from our international operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	By doing so we made an election to have our China business be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which resulted in earnings and profits of our international business in China being taxed both in the United States and China.
912750_15_ITEM8_P157_S2	Due to our NOL carryforward position, we do not expect to be able to utilize related foreign tax credits (FTC) before they expire and accordingly recorded a full valuation allowance against these credits.
912750_15_ITEM8_P157_S3	These FTCs are utilized in the alternative minimum tax (AMT) system to reduce current cash taxes.
912750_15_ITEM8_P157_S4	The result is a high effective tax rate in periods where our book income in China is high relative to our domestic book income.
912750_15_ITEM8_P157_S5	These effective tax rate fluctuations are magnified when net income approaches zero.
912750_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	At December 31, the components of our deferred tax asset (liability) were as follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion for federal income tax and $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion for state income tax purposes, respectively, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_15_ITEM8_P159_S1	NOL carryforwards of $155 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_15_ITEM8_P159_S2	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $64 million of our various gross state NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P159_S3	To the extent not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2033.
912750_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we had gross NOL carryforwards for international income tax purposes of approximately $17 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P160_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance since we have ceased operating in these jurisdictions and it is remote that the NOL carryforwards will be realized in the future.
912750_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had foreign tax credits of approximately $ 547 million and $ 535 million, respectively, which will expire during the years 2022 through 2024.
912750_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P163_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing deferred tax assets.
912750_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	The change in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows at December 31:
912750_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	As the result of the divestiture of the Malaysia operations in 2014, all of the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance were transferred to the buyer.
912750_15_ITEM8_P165_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off the other international deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances since we have ceased operating in these jurisdictions and it is remote that the NOL carryforwards will be realized in the future.
912750_15_ITEM8_P165_S2	In fourth quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded valuation allowances related to insufficient estimated future domestic taxable income to fully utilize foreign tax credits before they expire of $ 12 million , $ 114 million , and $ 421 million , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	The foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is fully offset by a valuation allowance.
912750_15_ITEM8_P166_S1	In 2014, we released $ 1 million of state valuation allowances due to utilization of the related state NOLs.
912750_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	For the years ended December 31, our stock-based compensation expense consisted of the following:
912750_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we had approximately $70 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards.
912750_15_ITEM8_P168_S1	The full amount is expected to be recognized within four years .
912750_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	Equity awards consist of service-based and performance- or market-based restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
912750_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	Stock-based compensation classified as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors are currently granted under the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan (2011 Plan).
912750_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance- and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	Compensation expense for equity awards is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting periods.
912750_15_ITEM8_P172_S0	Shares available for grant under our 2011 Plan are reduced by 1.87 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_15_ITEM8_P172_S1	At December 31, 2014 , we had approximately (1) 2.3 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing plan if all future awards under our 2011 Plan are stock options, or (2) 1.2 million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing plan if all future awards under our 2011 Plan are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_15_ITEM8_P172_S2	Thus far, the majority of the awards under our 2011 Plan have been granted as restricted stock unit awards.
912750_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	At December 31, 2014 , our employees held approximately 1.9 million shares of non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_15_ITEM8_P173_S1	These shares primarily vest over three to five years and vesting is dependent upon the employee s continued service with our Company.
912750_15_ITEM8_P173_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2014 , our employees held approximately 0.9 million shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting criteria (all of which are currently considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	To the extent we have treasury shares available, we utilize treasury shares when restricted stock is issued or restricted stock units vest.
912750_15_ITEM8_P175_S0	The following table provides information about restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity.
912750_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $43 million , $47 million and $44 million , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_15_ITEM8_P177_S1	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
912750_15_ITEM8_P177_S2	We issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_15_ITEM8_P178_S0	The excess tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital and is calculated as the amount by which the tax deduction we receive exceeds the deferred tax asset associated with recorded stock-based compensation expense.
912750_15_ITEM8_P178_S1	We did not realize an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation for 2014 , 2013 or 2012 because we did not have sufficient taxable income to fully realize the deduction.
912750_15_ITEM8_P178_S2	At December 31, 2014 , we had unrecognized net operating losses of $99 million related to stock-based compensation.
912750_15_ITEM8_P179_S0	The following table below provides information about stock option activity.
912750_15_ITEM8_P180_S0	_________________ (1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of our common stock at the indicated date, or at the time of exercise, exceeds the exercise price of the option.

912750_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	In September 2013, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board approved the SVAP to be administered under the 2011 Plan.
912750_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	The SVAP pays substantially all full-time domestic, nonexecutive employees a cash payment based on a percentage of salary upon each incremental $5 increase in our 30 -calendar day average share price.
912750_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	Each price threshold can be reached only once during the term of the program.
912750_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	The SVAP's performance period lasts through December 31, 2015.

912750_15_ITEM8_P192_S3	Future changes in our stock price could cause the total cost of the plan to be significantly different than our estimates as of December 31, 2014 .

912750_15_ITEM8_P193_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we accrued $12 million for future cash settlement upon vesting of awards.
912750_15_ITEM8_P193_S2	The value of the awards, and the associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.

912750_15_ITEM8_P199_S2	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the IRS.

912750_15_ITEM8_P199_S5	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the plan.
912750_15_ITEM8_P199_S6	Our contribution with respect to each participant in the deferred compensation plan is reduced by the amount of contribution made by us to our 401(k) plan for that participant.

912750_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P203_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	_________________ (1) Our oil delivery commitments include commitments with Salt Lake City, Utah refiners.
912750_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	Our delivery commitments are for approximately 18,000 barrels of oil per day through 2020 and an additional 20,000 barrels of oil per day expected to start in 2016 and continuing through 2025.
912750_15_ITEM8_P204_S2	The 20,000 barrel per day delivery commitment represents approximately 7,300 MBbls of our committed oil volumes for each of the years 2016 through 2025.
912750_15_ITEM8_P204_S3	The timing may change due to timing of the refinery expansion completion.
912750_15_ITEM8_P204_S4	These commitments relate to our Uinta Basin production.
912750_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	Given the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related impact on our 2015 planned capital investments as well as the potential impact on development plans in future years, we could fail to deliver the minimum production required under these commitments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P205_S1	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $1.83 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	During the fourth quarter 2012, we settled a lawsuit where the Company was the plaintiff and recorded a gain of $13 million in Other income (expense) Other, net on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are organizationally structured along geographic operating segments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P208_S1	Our current operating segments are the United States and China.
912750_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	Prior to classifying our Malaysia business as held for sale and discontinued operations, we reported a business segment for Malaysia.
912750_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	The accounting policies of each of our operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
912750_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
912750_15_ITEM8_P210_S1	Income tax allocations have been determined based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment.
912750_15_ITEM8_P210_S2	In order to reflect the double taxation of our earnings and profits in China, we have applied the statutory rates for China and the U.S. to determine our income tax allocation for our China operations in the following three tables.
912750_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes total assets from our discontinued operations of $ 916 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes total assets from our discontinued operations of $ 866 million .
912750_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	The following table presents information about supplemental cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31:
912750_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	Kevin M. Robinson, our former Vice President Asia through February 10, 2014, and Susan G. Riggs, our current Treasurer, were minority owners of Huffco International L.L.C. (Huffco).
912750_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	joined the Company, we acquired from Huffco an entity now known as Newfield China, LDC, the owner of a 12% interest in a three-field unit located in Bohai Bay, offshore China.
912750_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	Huffco retained preferred shares of Newfield China that provided for dividend payments.
912750_15_ITEM8_P215_S2	During the third quarter of 2013, we purchased the outstanding preferred shares of Newfield China from Huffco for approximately $20 million , which was recorded as a charge against retained earnings.
912750_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	As a result of decreasing commodity pricing and projected lower capital spending for 2015, the Company executed a reduction in force during the first quarter of 2015, which reduced approximately 15% of the total headcount.
912750_15_ITEM8_P216_S1	We incurred severance and related costs as a result of these workforce reductions totaling approximately $10 million , which will be reflected in our first quarter 2015 financial statements.
912750_15_ITEM8_P217_S0	The results of operations by quarter for the indicated periods are as follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P218_S0	_________________ (1) Oil, gas and NGL revenues and Income (loss) from operations are specific to our continuing operations.
912750_15_ITEM8_P218_S1	(2) During the quarter ended March 31, 2014, we sold our Malaysia business and recorded a gain of approximately $388 million ( $252 million , after tax).
912750_15_ITEM8_P218_S2	During the fourth quarter, we reduced the previously recognized gain by $15 million ( $10 million , after tax) due to recording an allowance against a receivable.
912750_15_ITEM8_P218_S3	See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," for additional information.
912750_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	(3) The sum of the individual quarterly earnings (loss) per share may not agree with year-to-date earnings (loss) per share as each quarterly computation is based on the income or loss for that quarter and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter.
912750_15_ITEM8_P219_S1	(4) Basic and diluted earnings per share includes an adjustment of $20 million related to the repurchase of preferred shares of a now wholly-owned subsidiary.
912750_15_ITEM8_P219_S2	See Note 2, "Earnings Per Share" for additional detail.
912750_15_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following tables present the results of our oil and gas producing activities for the years ending December 31:
912750_15_ITEM8_P221_S0	The following tables present costs incurred for oil and gas property acquisitions, exploration and development for the respective years:
912750_15_ITEM8_P222_S0	(2) Other items impacting the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties which are not included in total costs incurred are as follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P223_S0	Capitalized costs for our oil and gas producing activities consisted of the following at the end of each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2014 :
912750_15_ITEM8_P224_S0	Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_15_ITEM8_P224_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P224_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_15_ITEM8_P225_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_15_ITEM8_P225_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into our reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.
912750_15_ITEM8_P225_S2	The technical employee responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, with more than 30 years of experience (including over 20 years of experience in reserve estimation).
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S0	Our reserves estimates are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data.
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S1	These estimates, made by our petroleum engineering staff, are reviewed annually with management and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data.
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S2	The data reviewed includes, among other things, seismic data, well logs, production tests, reservoir pressures, and individual well and field performance data.
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S3	The data incorporated into our interpretations includes structure and isopach maps, individual well and field performance and other engineering and geological work products such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field projections.
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S4	Additionally, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices factor into estimating quantities of reserves.
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S5	Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental regulations, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with development drilling.
912750_15_ITEM8_P226_S6	Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner.
912750_15_ITEM8_P227_S0	The following is a discussion of our proved reserves and reserve additions and revisions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P228_S0	Our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year-end 2014 were 301 million barrels compared to 270 million barrels and 237 million barrels at year-end 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P228_S1	Our proved NGL reserves at year-end 2014 were 76 million barrels compared to 68 million barrels and 37 million barrels at year-end 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P228_S2	Our proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2014 were 1.6 Tcf compared to 1.6 Tcf and 1.8 Tcf year-end 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P228_S3	Liquids comprised about 58% , 55% and 48% of our proved reserves at year-end 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
912750_15_ITEM8_P229_S0	During 2014 , our proved reserves increased 132 MMBOE as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases of reserves in place) and revisions of previous estimates.
912750_15_ITEM8_P229_S1	We expect the majority of future reserve growth to be associated with infill drilling, extensions of current fields and new discoveries, as well as improved recovery operations and purchases of proved properties.
912750_15_ITEM8_P229_S2	The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future.
912750_15_ITEM8_P230_S0	We added 72 MMBOE of proved reserves through discoveries, extensions and other additions, and 9 MMBOE through purchases.
912750_15_ITEM8_P230_S1	Drilling additions related to our domestic resource plays constituted 99% of our additions.
912750_15_ITEM8_P230_S2	Of the drilling additions, 52 MMBOE were proved undeveloped additions and 54 million barrels were liquids reserves.
912750_15_ITEM8_P231_S0	Total proved reserve revisions in 2014 were a positive 51 MMBOE or 8% of the beginning of year proved reserves.
912750_15_ITEM8_P231_S1	They included a positive 3 MMBOE price revision which was primarily related to our onshore natural gas plays.
912750_15_ITEM8_P232_S0	In mature plays, dominated by infill drilling and where reserve growth cannot be classified as an extension or discovery, the change in reserves is captured as a revision.
912750_15_ITEM8_P232_S1	In 2014 , our revisions associated with the development of existing fields were a positive 77 MMBOE.
912750_15_ITEM8_P232_S2	The remaining 29 MMBOE negative revisions are associated with development plan changes and well performance.
912750_15_ITEM8_P233_S0	In 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we sold proved reserves associated with non-strategic assets and acreage trades.
912750_15_ITEM8_P234_S0	The following table sets forth our total net proved reserves and our total net proved developed and undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2011 , 2012 , 2013 and 2014 and the changes in our total net proved reserves during the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 :
912750_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	_________________ (1) All of our reserves in China are associated with production sharing contracts and are calculated using the economic interest method.
912750_15_ITEM8_P235_S1	We used the economic interest method in Malaysia until we sold our Malaysia business in 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P236_S0	_________________ (1) All of our reserves in China are associated with production sharing contracts and are calculated using the economic interest method.
912750_15_ITEM8_P236_S1	We used the economic interest method in Malaysia until we sold our Malaysia business in 2014.
912750_15_ITEM8_P237_S0	The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved oil and gas reserves is as follows:
912750_15_ITEM8_P238_S0	Set forth in the table below is a summary of the changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for our proved oil and gas reserves during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 :

912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Sustained lower prices will reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce and may result in impairments of our proved reserves or reduction of our proved undeveloped reserves.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Oil, natural gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	The markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have historically been, and will likely remain, volatile.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	For example, record high U.S. oil production has contributed to global oil supply exceeding demand, which has caused oil prices to drop precipitously since September 2014.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S6	The price of oil (WTI) in January 2016 averaged approximately $31.78 per barrel, as compared to approximately $95 per barrel in January 2014.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Natural gas prices also experienced significant declines in 2014 and 2015, as the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price during that period ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.76 per MMBtu in December 2015.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Likewise, NGLs have experienced significant recent declines in realized prices.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P0_S9	The price of propane (Mont Belvieu) ranged from a high of $1.73 per gallon in February 2014 to a low of $0.30 per gallon in January 2016 and the price of ethane (Mont Belvieu) ranged from a high of $0.45 per gallon in January 2014 to a low of $0.13 per gallon in December 2015.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some, but not all, of the factors that can cause fluctuations include:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	While we cannot predict whether or for how long commodity prices will remain at this level or decline further, we have made adjustments in response to the current strong supply and soft demand, such as modifying our 2016 capital investment plan based on anticipated commodity prices, historical drilling success, and markets for our products.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These adjustments are likely to influence our profitability and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, our stock price in the market is influenced by fluctuations in oil and gas prices.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Sustained material declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may have the following effects on our business:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	reduce the carrying value of our assets in our balance sheet through ceiling test writedowns.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may be responsible for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Under state and federal law, oil and gas companies are obligated to plug and abandon (P A) a well and restore the lease to pre-operating conditions after operations cease.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	U.S. state and federal regulations allow the government to call upon predecessors in interest of oil and gas leases to pay for P A, restoration and decommissioning obligations if the current operator fails to fulfill those obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Moreover, offshore P A liabilities can be very significant.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As part of our strategic shift from offshore Gulf of Mexico operations to onshore U.S. operations, we divested our assets on the outer continental shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).
912750_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As part of those divestitures, we entered into various arrangements with the purchasers whereby the purchasers assumed our P A liabilities and other liabilities related to decommissioning such GoM assets.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Several onshore and offshore E P companies have sought bankruptcy protection.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	For example, in 2012 an offshore operator entered bankruptcy proceedings and sought to discharge its P A liabilities in bankruptcy.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The bankruptcy court allowed the discharge because the government identified a predecessor in interest of the lease to perform the P A obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The predecessor in interest was forced to accept P A liabilities estimated at over $100 million.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If purchasers of our former GoM assets, or any successor owners of those assets, are unable to meet their P A and other decommissioning obligations due to bankruptcy, dissolution or other related liquidity issues, we may be unable to rely on our arrangements with them to fulfill (or provide reimbursement for) those obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In those circumstances, the government may seek to impose the bankrupt entity s P A obligations on us and any other predecessors in interest.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Such payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Moreover, recent changes to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management s (BOEM) bonding requirements have the potential to adversely impact the financial condition of operators in the GoM and increase the number of operators seeking bankruptcy protection, given the current commodities market.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In September 2015, the BOEM issued draft guidance (the Draft Guidance ) describing revised supplemental bonding procedures the agency plans to use to impose financial assurance obligations for decommissioning activities on the federal OCS.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	bonding changes in a revised Notice to Lessees (NTL) in replacement of an existing NTL on supplemental bonding that was made effective on August 28, 2008.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Among other things, the Draft Guidance proposes to eliminate the waiver exemption currently allowed by BOEM, whereby certain operators on the OCS projecting a relatively large net worth and meeting certain other criteria have the option of being exempted from posting bonds or other acceptable assurances for such operator s decommissioning obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Currently, qualifying operators may self-insure to meet supplemental bonding requirements, but only so long as the cumulative decommissioning liability amount being self-insured by the operator is no more than 50% of the operator s net worth.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Under the Draft Guidance, this waiver option would be eliminated and operators would only be able to self-insure for an amount that is no more than 10% of their tangible net worth.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Projected decommissioning costs of operations in the GoM continue to increase, and the declining price of oil and gas has adversely affected the net worth of many operators.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	BOEM s revisions to its supplemental bonding process could result in the revocation of waivers currently held by the entities to whom we divested our GoM assets.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If those entities lose their supplemental bonding waiver, they will have to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the costs of which could be significant.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Moreover, BOEM s Draft Guidance is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which will in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, exceed the surety bond market s ability to provide such additional financial assurance.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the declining oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety may have about the priority of their lien on the operators' collateral.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Consequently, BOEM s proposed changes could result in additional operators in the GoM initiating bankruptcy proceedings, which in turn could result in the government seeking to impose P A costs on predecessors in interest in the event that the current operator cannot meet its P A obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, we could find ourselves liable to pay for the P A costs of any entity we divested our GoM assets to, which payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity in Oklahoma and elsewhere could increase our costs of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We dispose of large volumes of water produced alongside oil and natural gas produced water in connection with our drilling and production operations, pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	While these permits are issued under existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	There exists a growing concern that the injection of produced water into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic events in certain areas, including Oklahoma and Texas, where we operate.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are pursuing initiatives designed to impose additional requirements in the permitting and operating of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For example, Oklahoma has taken numerous regulatory actions in response to concerns related to the operation of produced water disposal wells and induced seismicity.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Oklahoma has adopted a traffic light system, wherein the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In September 2014, the OCC adopted rules for operators of produced water disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas, or Areas of Interest, requiring operators to monitor and record well pressure and injected volume on a daily basis and further requiring operators of wells permitted for disposal of 20,000 barrels per day or more of produced water to conduct more frequent mechanical integrity testing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	On March 25, 2015, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission s Oil and Gas Conservation Division (OGCD) issued a directive, expanding the Areas of Interest for induced seismicity.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Under the new directive, operators of 347 disposal wells located within the expanded Areas of Interest of the Arbuckle formation were given until April 2015 to demonstrate that their wells were not disposing into or in communication with the crystalline basement rock.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Operators of wells in contact or communication with the basement rock were required to reduce the depth of, or plug back, those wells or, alternatively, to reduce disposal volume by 50 percent.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S8	On July 17, 2015, the OGCD issued another directive, further expanding the covered area to include an additional 211 disposal wells.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Under this second directive, operators were given until August 2015 to prove that they were not injecting below the Arbuckle formation or, as necessary, to plug back those wells in contact or communication with the crystalline basement rock, without the option of reducing disposal volume by 50 percent.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S10	The OGCD imposed further reductions on oil and natural gas wastewater disposal well volume in a prescribed area of northern Oklahoma County and southern Logan County in August 2015, requiring operators to reduce disposal volumes for affected wells by approximately 38 percent below 2014 reported volumes, within a specified 60-day period.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S11	OGCD imposed additional restrictions on wells in Fairview County in January 2016, requiring that all disposal wells located within 3.5 miles of a seismic event s epicenter reduce injection volumes by 50 percent and 25 percent for wells within 10 miles of the event s epicenter.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S12	The OGCD has also begun imposing additional testing requirements on wells located within 15 miles of an event s epicenter.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P13_S13	Additional regulatory action in this area is likely, and the Oklahoma legislature has introduced new legislation to expand the OCC s authority to address concerns related to disposal wells and induced seismicity.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	February 2016, the OGCD released a wastewater volume reduction plan.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The plan calls for the operators of over 240 injection wells to reduce underground wastewater injections.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The plan covers more than 5,200 square miles in northwest Oklahoma, which is near our operations, and seeks reductions of more than 500,000 barrels of wastewater per day.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Implementation of the plan will be phased in over the next two months.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In Texas, in 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) published a new rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If a permittee or a prospective permittee fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Restriction on the volumes permissible for injection or a lack of alternative waste disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, such as mandated produced water recycling in some portion or all of our operations, may reduce our profitability.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	These developments may result in additional levels of regulation, or increased complexity and costs with respect to existing regulations, that could lead to operational delays or increased operating and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our use of oil and natural gas price derivative contracts may limit future revenues and cash flows from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us and any inability to maintain our current derivative positions in the future specifically could result in financial losses or could reduce our income .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	As part of our risk management program, we generally use derivative contracts to protect a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24-36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	A significant portion of our oil derivative contracts include sold puts.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	If market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the difference between our floors or swaps and the associated sold puts, limiting the downside protection of these contracts.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In the case of acquisitions, we may use derivative contracts to protect acquired production from commodity price volatility for a longer period.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While the use of derivative contracts may limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the volume subject to derivative contracts or there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the derivative transactions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The use of derivative transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to perform their financial and other obligations under such transactions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts, enter receivership or seek bankruptcy or similar protection, that could result in an economic loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Additionally, in the current commodity price environment, we have concluded that utilizing derivative contracts to lock in historically low prices for oil and natural gas for some of our anticipated future production is not in the best interest of the Company and may continue to hold that conclusion in the future.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	As a result, as of year-end 2015, a meaningful portion of our expected oil production for 2016 and beyond remained, and may continue to remain, unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If we are ultimately unable to, or choose not to, hedge additional expected oil production volumes for 2016 and beyond, we will be subject to further potential commodity price volatility, which may result in lower than expected cash flows and revenues.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our limited ability to hedge our NGL production and commodity basis differentials could adversely impact our cash flows from operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	A liquid, readily available and commercially viable market for hedging NGL and commodity basis differentials has not developed in the same way that exists for oil and natural gas priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S8	The current direct NGL and commodity basis differential hedging market is constrained in terms of price, volume, duration and number of counterparties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P17_S9	This limits both our ability to hedge our NGL production and price difference based on point of sale effectively or at all.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If the current price levels for NGL continue or decrease in the future or the commodity basis differentials versus WTI or Henry Hub negatively increase, our cash flows from operations would be affected.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that could be greater than cash flows from operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Although we have reduced our capital expenditures in 2016 to more closely align with our projected cash flows, we anticipate that our 2016 capital investment levels may exceed our projected cash flows from operations in 2016.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	As a result, we may borrow additional funds under our credit facility, due in part to our decision to continue certain portions of our drilling program in order to avoid future lease renewals to retain certain acreage.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If necessary, we may sell non-strategic assets or potentially access public debt and/or equity markets to fund any shortfall.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our ability to generate operating cash flows is subject to many risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells; prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs; production costs; availability of economical gathering, processing, storage and transportation in our operating areas; our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, unbudgeted acquisitions and the promulgation of new regulatory requirements.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or changes in drilling plans.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Alternatively, we may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected, if:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	we are unable to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness of $2.5 billion , including $ 39 million in borrowings under our money market lines of credit.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us and any future agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	These restrictions and our level of indebtedness could limit our ability to:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions, and to comply with other covenants and restrictions in our financing agreements, can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	This failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, or repay such debt with the proceeds from a sale of assets or a public offering of securities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Factors that will affect our ability to successfully complete a public offering, refinance our debt or conduct an asset sale include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex and inexact.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The process relies on interpretations of geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The extent, quality and reliability of these data can vary.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the effect of government regulation, taxes and availability of funds.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	In addition, we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil, natural gas and NGL prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In accordance with SEC requirements, we calculate the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves using the SEC s pricing methodology for calculating proved reserves, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year-end discounted at 10%.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used as of the date of an estimate.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, the decline in our reserves will eventually result in a decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P29_S7	Future oil, natural gas and NGL production is, therefore, highly dependent on our success in efficiently finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns and based upon current commodity prices, will result in future ceiling test writedowns or other impairments .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We evaluate the ceiling test quarterly and at December 31, 2015 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.59 per MMBtu for natural gas and $50.11 per barrel for oil.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Using these prices, our ceiling for the U.S. did not exceed the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties resulting in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S7	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded U.S. ceiling test writedowns of approximately $4.8 billion ( $3.3 billion after tax).
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Using SEC pricing, our ceiling for China at December 31, 2015 did not exceed the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, resulting in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P31_S9	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded China ceiling test writedowns of approximately $118 million ( $60 million after tax).
912750_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, we believe that an impairment in the first quarter of 2016 could exceed $500 million .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The risk that we will be required to further writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile for a prolonged period of time.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Drilling is a costly and high-risk activity .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or gas is present or may be produced economically.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Future drilling activities may not be successful, and if unsuccessful, this could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses and cash flows by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If any of these risks occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	repairs and remediation costs to resume operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Further, offshore operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoons or other adverse weather conditions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our China operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Regions in which we operate have recently experienced drought conditions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P40_S8	If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and in turn, our results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	While we maintain insurance against some potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The occurrence of any of the foregoing events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage or not indemnified, could reduce revenue and cash flows and the funds available to us for our exploration, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	See also We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity, and other factors.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S7	If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling in these projects.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S9	In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S10	As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Currently low oil prices, reduced capital spending and numerous other factors, many of which are beyond our control, could result in our failure to establish production on undeveloped acreage, and, if we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S12	The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 64% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S13	At that date, we had leases representing approximately 94,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016, approximately 157,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2017, and approximately 97,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S14	Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S15	Our proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S16	The development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S17	At December 31, 2015, approximately 35% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S18	Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S19	Our reserve estimates assume we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S20	These assumptions, however, may not prove to be accurate.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S21	We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled, or that the results of such development will be as estimated.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S22	If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S23	In addition, under the SEC s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S24	A removal of such reserves could adversely affect our business.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P42_S25	The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand or other proppant materials, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM, and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Certain municipalities have already banned hydraulic fracturing, and courts have upheld those moratoria in some instances.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In the past several years, dozens of states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including, for example, notice to and pre approval by BLM of the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities; development and pre approval by BLM of a plan for managing and containing flowback fluids and produced water recovered during the hydraulic fracturing process; implementation of measures designed to protect usable water from hydraulic fracturing activities; and public disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	A final decision is pending, however.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	In addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P45_S5	The adoption of new federal rules or regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could lead to increased operating costs, delays and curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which in turn could materially adversely affect our operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Several governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and a formal review by EPA s Science Advisory Board.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	These existing or any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S7	The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Development activities require the use of water.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	For example, the hydraulic fracturing process that we employ to produce commercial quantities of natural gas and oil from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water in addition to the water we use to develop our waterflood in the GMBU.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In these cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the operating cost.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations, such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas and oil.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In recent history, public concern surrounding increased seismicity has heightened focus on our industry s use of water in operations, which may cause increased costs, regulations or environmental initiatives impacting our use or disposal of water.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Furthermore, future environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells could cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, which may result in increased operating costs and have an effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	New regulations on the transportation of crude oil by rail, like those issued via emergency orders by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2014, may increase our transportation costs.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	constraints and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulation.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental, natural resource protection, and other governmental regulations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Matters subject to regulation include the following, in addition to the other matters discussed under the caption Regulation in Items 1 and 2 of this report:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource risk mitigation, damages and other environmental or habitat damages.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We also could be required to install and operate expensive pollution controls, engage in environmental risk management or limit or even cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S4	These and other potential legislative proposals, along with any applicable legislation introduced and passed in Congress, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S5	See also The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S7	Additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, (GHGs), present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) pre-construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case by case basis.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	More recently, in December 2015, the EPA finalized rules added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers of hydraulically fractured wells.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	These changes to EPA s GHG emissions reporting rule could result in increased compliance costs.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Also, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent in 2025.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S7	The BLM proposed similar regulations designed to reduce methane emissions for oil and gas activities on federal lands in January 2016 that seek to impose limits on venting and flaring and would require enhanced leak detection and repair programs.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P55_S8	Increased regulation of methane and other GHGs have the potential to result in increased compliance costs and, consequently, adversely affect our operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Severe limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds and other institutions.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P57_S4	We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative contracts and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P57_S5	In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, and swaps market participants, such as Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain swaps to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, unless an exception from mandatory clearing is available, and if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	To date, the CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The CFTC has not yet required the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including commodity swaps.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the clearing requirement for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, along with changes to the markets for swaps as a result of the trade execution requirement, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S5	If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S6	In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S7	Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S8	If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in our cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S9	Therefore, we are unable to determine the future costs on our derivative activities at this time.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P59_S10	Higher costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Act can create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risks, including market price fluctuations associated with anticipated production of oil and gas.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Act and related rules and regulations promulgated by CFTC could potentially increase the cost of Newfield s risk management activities, which could adversely affect our available liquidity, materially alter the terms of our swap contracts, reduce the availability of swaps to hedge or mitigate risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing swap contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, including by becoming more volatile and less predictable, which also could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In December 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules to amend the CEA to establish position limits for certain commodity futures and options contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, including those derivative instruments that we use.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If the CFTC position limit regulations are ultimately adopted substantially in the form proposed, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Until the CFTC adopts final rules with respect to position limits and any exemptions for bona fide derivative transactions or off-setting positions from those limits, we will be unable to determine whether the CFTC s proposed rules could result in additional derivative costs or adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	To the extent Newfield transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, it may become subject to such regulations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on the leases or units containing the leasehold acreage .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Leases on oil and gas properties normally have a term of three to five years and will expire unless, prior to expiration of the lease term, production in paying quantities is established.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If the leases expire and we are unable to renew them, we will lose the right to develop the related properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The risk of the foregoing increases in periods of sustained low commodity prices due to the corresponding impact on our drilling plans and the likely decrease in what is considered economic production under the leases.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including commodity prices, drilling results, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Future legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Additionally, future federal or state legislation may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Potential legislation, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	These changes could include, but are not limited to:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal and state income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Additionally, legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes states impose on oil and natural gas extraction.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Moreover, the President of the United States has proposed, as part of the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2017, to impose an "oil fee" of $10.25 on a per barrel equivalent of crude oil.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S5	This fee would be collected on domestically produced and imported products.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S6	The fee would be phased in evenly over five years, beginning October 1, 2016.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P65_S7	The adoption of this, or similar proposals, could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have risks associated with our China operations .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Ownership of property interests and production operations in China are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our China operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Our China operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation, investment and transparency issues.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our China operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Competition for, or the loss of, our senior management or experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel and the loss of any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a seasoned management team and experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P69_S4	In the past, competition for these professionals was strong, and in a price recovery environment may be strong again, which could result in future retention and attraction issues.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Our competitors include multinational oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S4	In addition, high commodity prices and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S5	We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S6	Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S7	As a consequence, our competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S8	If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P70_S9	Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified field personnel could adversely affect financial condition and results of operations .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment as demand for that equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	These factors have caused significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Similarly, lower oil and natural gas prices generally result in a decline in service costs due to reduced demand for drilling and completion services.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	supplies, which could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or restrict operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S3	See also The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S5	We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S6	Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S7	Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S8	Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S9	We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S10	We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability and other coverages.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S11	Consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution and other environmental issues, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S12	For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).
912750_16_ITEM1A_P72_S13	In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and divestitures .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	As part of our business strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make acquisitions of oil and gas properties and to divest non-strategic assets.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Suitable acquisition properties or suitable buyers of our non-strategic assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	These risks include that the acquired properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flows at anticipated levels.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Also, the integration of properties we acquire could be difficult.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire properties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P76_S4	The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	These assessments are complex and the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In addition, our divestitures may pose significant residual risks to the Company, such as divestitures where we retain certain liabilities or we have legal successor liability due to the bankruptcy or dissolution of the purchaser.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S4	See for example We may be responsible for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interest we no longer own.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Generally, uneconomic or unsuccessful acquisitions and divestitures may divert management s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P77_S6	We depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S3	We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S5	It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S6	We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any cyber incidents or interruptions to our arrangements with third parties to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse or destruction of proprietary or other information, or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S7	As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S8	We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P78_S9	We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S6	Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S7	Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of us .
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S8	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to affect a change of control, to acquire us or to replace incumbent management, including, for example, limitations on shareholders ability to remove directors, call special meetings and to propose and nominate directors or otherwise propose actions for approval at stockholder meetings, as well as the ability of our board of directors to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P79_S9	In addition, our change of control severance plan, change of control severance agreements with certain officers and our omnibus stock plans and deferred compensation plan contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of equity awards and acceleration of deferred compensation, upon a change of control.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, or could reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of us.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Delays in obtaining licenses, permits, and other government authorizations required to conduct our operations could adversely affect our business.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Our operations require licenses, permits, and in some cases renewals of licenses and permits from various governmental authorities.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Our ability to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to changes in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable government agencies, among other factors.
912750_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our inability to obtain, or our loss of or denial of extension, to any of these licenses or permits could hamper our ability to produce revenues or cash flows from our operations.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	In early 2012, through a voluntary environmental audit, we discovered potential violations of section 404 of the Clean Water Act relating to possible unpermitted discharges of fill materials into certain wetlands and drainages in the Uinta Basin.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The potential violations were discovered on certain Newfield locations and several locations acquired in 2011.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	In June 2012, we self-disclosed these potential violations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), in accordance with the EPA s Audit Policy and an interagency memorandum of understanding with the Corps.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Corps initially indicated to us that it would not pursue penalty charges, but instead would work with us to restore the unpermitted discharges and acquire the appropriate after-the-fact permits.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S4	The EPA later inquired with the Corps, and was informed about the potential violations.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S5	Thereafter, the EPA initiated an administrative enforcement action against Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM3_P0_S6	The EPA evaluated the discharges and our proposed restoration and mitigation, and a negotiated settlement was finalized.

912750_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	_________________ (1) Continuing operations only (excludes Malaysia).
912750_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
912750_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our operations are focused primarily on large scale, onshore liquids-rich resource plays in the United States.
912750_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our principal areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota, the Uinta Basin of Utah and the Maverick and Gulf Coast basins of Texas.
912750_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	In addition, we have oil developments offshore China.
912750_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced.
912750_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and affect:
912750_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	the amount of cash flows available for capital investments; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Crude oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly over the last year and remain low into the first quarter of 2016.
912750_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Nevertheless, we had many operational, financial and strategic successes in 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	domestic business restructured to better utilize resources and improve cost efficiencies.
912750_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We have adapted our 2016 business plan in response to the continuation of low commodity prices:
912750_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	implement a plan to further reduce domestic per unit lease operating costs.
912750_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	While we expect to achieve savings from cost reductions during 2016, given the lower oil and natural gas price environment as compared to 2015, our revenues are expected to be significantly lower in 2016 as compared to 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our continuing operations consist of exploration, development and production activities in the United States and China.
912750_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Revenues from domestic operations of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 42% lower than 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The lower revenues were attributable to a 46% decrease in the average revenue per BOE compared to 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Domestic liquids production increased 12% year over year, reducing the impact of lower commodity prices by $236 million.
912750_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our 2015 domestic crude oil production increased 15%, primarily due to doubling our Anadarko Basin oil volumes from 2014 levels.
912750_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Additionally, Williston Basin and Eagle Ford each experienced year over year oil production increases of 3%.
912750_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	Domestic NGL production increased 4%, while natural gas production decreased 2% from 2014 levels.
912750_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	Adjusted for the sale of Granite Wash assets in the third quarter of 2014 (as discussed in Note 6 , Oil and Gas Properties and Other Property and Equipment, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report), NGL and natural gas production increased 16% and 8%, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	NGL production volumes increased in the Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin by 20% and 40%, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	Natural gas production in the Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin increased 42% and 20%, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenues from domestic operations of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 26% higher than 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase was primarily due to a 38% year-over-year increase in our liquids production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Increased oil production generated approximately 81% of the total revenue increase primarily due to production increases in our Anadarko, Williston and Uinta Basins of 103%, 46% and 15% respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase related to higher oil production was partially offset by lower oil prices, which reduced the overall oil volume and price impact to 58% of the total revenue growth.
912750_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	Increased NGL production in the Anadarko Basin, Eagle Ford and Williston Basin of 147%, 63% and 55%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014 generated approximately 25% of the total revenue increase.
912750_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	Approximately 18% of the total revenue increase was due to higher natural gas prices received during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, production from domestic operations increased 20% primarily due to increased liquids production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our total 2014 domestic liquids production increased 38% over the prior year due to the success of our liquids-focused drilling programs.
912750_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Almost 60% of the increase in total liquids was attributable to higher margin crude oil.
912750_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Natural gas production increased 2% due to associated gas production generated by our liquids-focused drilling programs.
912750_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our revenues from China were $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Approximately 85% of our 2015 production from China was from the Pearl development, which achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Revenues from China of $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 43% lower than 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the temporary shut-in of production in Bohai Bay by the operator during the second and third quarters of 2014 for scheduled repair and maintenance activities, along with a 24% decrease in oil price during 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Production from China decreased 25% compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to the temporary shut-in.
912750_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Production resumed in August 2014; however, we had not accumulated sufficient quantities to schedule a lifting during the remainder of 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	Liftings from Bohai Bay resumed in the first quarter of 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P14_S5	The decrease in liftings from Bohai Bay was partially offset by the first lifting from our Pearl development in December 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The following table reflects our production/liftings from continuing operations and average realized commodity prices:
912750_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	_________________ (2) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	(3) Had we included the realized effects of derivative contracts, the domestic average realized prices would have been as follows:
912750_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table presents information about operating expenses for our continuing operations:
912750_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses per BOE for domestic operations increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the impact of ceiling test impairments of $4.8 billion .
912750_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Excluding these ceiling test impairments and depreciation, depletion and amortization, which was lower in 2015 due to the ceiling test impairments, domestic operating expenses per BOE decreased 16% from 2014 for the following primary reasons:
912750_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Lease operating expenses (LOE) decreased 27% on a per BOE basis primarily due to lower service costs and higher production volumes.
912750_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Service costs declined primarily in the Uinta and Anadarko basins period over period due to our increased focus on cost-reduction initiatives combined with downward service cost pressures in the industry due to lower oil and natural gas prices.
912750_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Transportation and processing expense increased 15% on a per BOE basis primarily due to the increase in combined gas and NGL volumes in SCOOP and STACK, which are subject to higher processing fees related to liquids-rich gas production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Production and other taxes on a per BOE basis decreased 60% year-over-year primarily due to lower revenues, and a higher percent of our 2015 production derived from areas with lower production tax rates.
912750_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Additional decreases were due to enhanced recovery credits and tax incentives for stripper wells for our Uinta Basin assets, which includes $ 7 million of credits that relates to prior years (see " Reclassifications and Out-of-Period Adjustments " in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report).
912750_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Excluding the impact of these additional tax incentive recoveries, production and other taxes as a percent of total revenue were 4.0% and 4.7% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) decreased 17% on a per BOE basis primarily due to the impact of $4.8 billion non-cash ceiling test impairments recorded in 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	We expect a further decrease in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the impairment recorded effective December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	General and administrative expense (G A) increased 7% primarily as a result of reduced capitalization of direct internal costs, workforce reductions, organization restructuring and stock-based compensation programs.
912750_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Excluding these items that affect comparability, gross G A costs decreased 15% year-over-year primarily due to cost savings initiatives including a more than 20% reduction of our workforce.
912750_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	The following table presents information regarding G A expenses for our domestic operations:
912750_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	_________________ (1) Capitalized direct internal costs decrease is consistent with the reduced exploration and development activities in the Uinta, Williston and Maverick basins during 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	(2) Includes severance costs for workforce reductions in early 2015, as well as office-lease abandonment and other organizational restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Denver and Houston offices in 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	(3) SVAP Program decrease is associated with the decrease in the estimated fair value of the liability for our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP), which ended December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	During 2014, three thresholds were achieved that resulted in payments to employees.
912750_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	During 2015, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments of $4.8 billion due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The decrease primarily resulted from a 47% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 40% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since December 31, 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of current service cost reductions on our cash flow estimates.
912750_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Additionally during the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a $4 million rig impairment associated with our decision to indefinitely lay down both of our company-owned drilling rigs in the Uinta Basin.
912750_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Other operating expense decreased $16 million primarily due to equipment inventory impairments and legal settlements recorded in 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses increased $312 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a full year of production activity from our Pearl development and the ceiling test impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	development and our Bohai Bay field, the 2015 results are not comparable with 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The 2015 increase was slightly offset by a $5 million decrease in production and other taxes.
912750_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	A new regulation was implemented by the Chinese government in early 2015 resulting in no special levy taxes on production with an actual realized contract price below $65 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	As such, until our contract prices exceed $65 per barrel, we will continue to experience lower production and other taxes in China.
912750_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Pearl development produced at a rate of 13,000 BOEPD (net) from five horizontal wells and one vertical well during the fourth quarter of 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses for our continuing operations:
912750_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, total operating expenses per BOE for domestic operations increased 2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The primary reasons for the change follow:
912750_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Lease operating expenses decreased 6% on a per BOE basis.
912750_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Higher production volumes, coupled with flat year-over-year well repair costs in all areas, generated approximately 60% of the per BOE reduction.
912750_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	The remaining decrease relates primarily to successful water and compression cost management initiatives in our Williston Basin, Arkoma and Eagle Ford plays.
912750_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Transportation and processing expense increased 6% on a per BOE basis primarily due to a 59% increase in NGL volumes processed during 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Production and other taxes as a percent of revenue increased 1%.
912750_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Approximately one-half of this increase was the result of higher tax incentives as well as an ad valorem tax adjustment in 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	The remaining increase, on a percent of revenue basis, was primarily due to the significant growth of our Williston Basin production, which is subject to a higher production tax rate.
912750_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	On a per BOE basis, the increase was driven by increased liquids production as a percent of total production and the associated increase in average revenue per BOE from $45.91 for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $48.41 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 28% primarily due to the 20% increase in production volumes in 2014 compared to 2013, combined with a 7% increase in the cost per unit of production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increased cost per unit of production is primarily due to the transfer of approximately $760 million of unevaluated property costs into the full cost pool amortization base during the year.
912750_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The majority of the costs were transferred in the fourth quarter in response to the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting impact on our future development plans.
912750_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	General and administrative expense on a per BOE basis decreased 16% primarily due to increased production in 2014 as compared to 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	G A expense was flat year-over-year as increased employee-related expenses in 2014 were offset by higher capitalization of direct internal costs.
912750_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Employee-related expenses increased by $32 million for stock-based compensation, primarily due to our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program, which achieved three payout targets in 2014 compared to one in 2013 (see Note 14 , "Stock-Based Compensation," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report).
912750_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	The increase in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in labor-related costs associated primarily with the centralization of certain functions during the second half of 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we capitalized $135 million ($2.90 per BOE) of direct internal costs as compared to $107 million ($2.77 per BOE) during the comparable period of 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	This increase is primarily due to a higher portion of the costs associated with stock-based liability awards earned by employees who are directly involved with our exploration and development activities.
912750_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Other operating expense increased $12 million primarily due to equipment inventory value impairments and legal settlements during 2014 as compared to 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, total operating expenses per BOE for our China operations increased 11% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Results for 2014 include activity from Bohai Bay and our Pearl development, whereas 2013 results include only Bohai Bay.
912750_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	LOE per barrel increased over 100% as a result of one-time production preparation costs associated with our Pearl development, a higher tariff on crude oil produced from our Pearl development and higher operating costs associated with deepwater operations for our Pearl development.
912750_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	These increases were partially offset by a 37% decrease in production and other taxes per BOE, primarily due to the timing of liftings in China.
912750_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	Approximately 60% of our liftings in China were in the fourth quarter of 2014, which had significantly lower realized prices than 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years ended December 31.
912750_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Interest expense associated with unproved oil and gas properties is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Gross interest expense decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to the redemption of our 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the redemption of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 in April 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	This decrease was partially offset by the additional interest expense associated with our $700 million 5 % Senior Notes due 2026 issued in March 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	of our 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	See Note 10 , Debt , to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Capitalized interest decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to a reduction of the average amount of unproved oil and gas properties coupled with a reduced capitalization rate due to a reduction in our average borrowing rate.
912750_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The average balance of unproved oil and gas properties was consistent for the first three quarters of 2014 resulting in a relatively flat capitalized interest in 2014 as compared to 2013.
912750_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The fluctuations in commodity derivative income (expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding derivative contracts during these periods.
912750_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The $259 million gain recognized in Commodity derivative income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments is comprised of a $505 million realized gain and a $246 million unrealized loss.
912750_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	The amount of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives is the result of the change in the total fair value of our derivative positions from the prior year.
912750_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follows:
912750_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	_________________ (1) Represents the fair value included in the net derivative asset as of December 31, 2014 that have settled during 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Actual settlement amounts differ due to the changes in the fair value of the positions between the balance sheet date and the settlement date and are reflected in the realized gain (loss) noted in Note 4 , "Derivative Financial Instruments".
912750_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were 32%, 37% and 64%, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the change in valuation allowances, non-deductible expenses, state income taxes, the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates, and the impact of our China earnings being taxed in both the U.S and China.
912750_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our future effective tax rates may also be impacted by additional ceiling test writedowns or other items which generate deferred tax assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and/or reversal of such valuation allowances.
912750_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	The following table summarizes our tax activity that derives our 2015 effective tax rate.
912750_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	See Note 7 , "Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional disclosures.
912750_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the second quarter of 2013, our business in Malaysia met the criteria for classification as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	In February 2014, Newfield International Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the sale of our Malaysia business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad, a Malaysian public company, for $898 million.
912750_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	See Note 1 , Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 19 , Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the sale of our Malaysia business.
912750_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our 2014 and 2013 Malaysia revenues were primarily from the sale of crude oil.
912750_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore Malaysia operations was produced into FPSOs and sold periodically as barge quantities were accumulated.
912750_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Revenues were recorded when oil was lifted and sold, not when it was produced into FPSOs or onshore storage terminals.
912750_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	As a result, timing of liftings impacted period-to-period results.
912750_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from discontinued operations of $90 million were 89% lower than 2013 due to the sale of our Malaysia business in February 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The average realized price per BOE remained essentially flat for 2013 and through the close date of the sale in 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	The following table reflects our production and average realized commodity prices from discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31:
912750_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	________________ (1) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table presents our total operating expenses for discontinued operations for 2014, which decreased 89% compared to the same period of 2013 as a result of the sale of our Malaysia business in February 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following discussion is inclusive of both our continuing and discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.
912750_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, as well as the available borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	In response to future uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of an eventual recovery of crude oil and natural gas prices, which have declined significantly since the fourth quarter of 2014, our capital spending for 2015 was reduced 26% from 2014 levels to reduce deficit spending and preserve long-term liquidity.
912750_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	During 2015, as part of our strategy to optimize long-term liquidity, we:
912750_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We expect our 2016 budget will be financed through our cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, selling non-strategic assets or potentially accessing the public debt and equity markets.
912750_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our 2016 capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and direct internal costs of approximately $100 million , is expected to be approximately $625 - $675 million.
912750_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results; oil, natural gas and NGL prices; industry conditions; the prices and availability of goods and services; and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold.
912750_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions, and our ability to fund them, are unpredictable.
912750_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances or fluctuations in our cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	We continuously monitor our liquidity needs, coordinate our capital expenditure program with our expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluate our available alternative sources of liquidity, including accessing debt and equity capital markets in light of current and expected economic conditions.
912750_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	We believe that our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our operations will be adequate to fund 2016 operations and continue to meet our other obligations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
912750_16_ITEM7_P61_S3	Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
912750_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The amounts involved may be material.
912750_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Credit Arrangements and Other Financing Activities.
912750_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	In March 2015, we entered into the fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement.
912750_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	This amendment extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from June 2018 to June 2020 and increased the borrowing capacity from $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion .
912750_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	We incurred $7 million of financing costs related to this amendment, which will be amortized through June 2020.
912750_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	We also maintain money market lines of credit of $195 million.
912750_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	At December 31, 2015 , we had $39 million in borrowings under our money market lines of credit, no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	In April 2015, we completed the redemption of our $700 million aggregate principal of 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020.
912750_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The transaction included a premium payment of approximately $24 million .
912750_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	At December 31, 2015 , we had no scheduled maturities of senior notes until 2022.
912750_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior notes, please see Note 10 , Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and certain noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test writedowns and goodwill impairments) to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	At December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under our credit facility and do not foresee this changing in 2016.
912750_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of February 19, 2016 , we had $90 million outstanding under our money market lines of credit and $80 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
912750_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners.
912750_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital.
912750_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had negative working capital of $22 million and $161 million, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our primary source of capital and liquidity is cash flows provided by operations, which are primarily affected by the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as commodity prices, net of the effects of derivative contract settlements and changes in working capital.
912750_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our net cash flows provided by operations were approximately $1.2 billion in 2015 , $1.4 billion in 2014 (includes $3 million of cash flows provided by our Malaysia discontinued operations) and $1.4 billion in 2013 (includes $249 million of cash flows provided by our Malaysia discontinued operations).
912750_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	We had no cash flows provided by discontinued operations in 2015.
912750_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The primary driver of lower operating cash flows in 2015 was lower revenues as a result of lower commodity prices, which we expect to continue in 2016.
912750_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net cash used in investing activities for 2015 was $1.6 billion compared to $660 million for 2014 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase in net cash used in 2015 investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.4 billion received in 2014 from the sale of our Malaysia business and Granite Wash assets.
912750_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	Cash used for capital expenditures in 2015 was approximately $457 million lower due to our planned reductions in capital spending as compared to 2014.
912750_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities for 2015 was $380 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $808 million for 2014 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	During 2014, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal of 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 using the proceeds from the sale of our Granite Wash assets.
912750_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our capital investments for continuing operations for 2015 decreased 26% compared to 2014 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	The table below summarizes our capital investments.
912750_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	In April 2015, we announced plans to restructure our organization primarily in response to the current commodity price environment.
912750_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	See Note 16 , "Restructuring Costs," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations due by year as of December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes assets and liabilities associated with our derivative contracts, which are dependent on the commodity price at the time of the contract settlement.
912750_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	For a discussion regarding our derivative contracts, see Note 4 , "Derivative Financial Instruments," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	(2) Includes agreements for office space, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for office space and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our Uinta Basin production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	Given the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related impact on our 2016 planned capital investments, as well as the potential impact on development plans in future years, we could fail to deliver the minimum production required under these commitments.
912750_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we incur deficiency fees ranging from $3.50 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	Based on forecasted production levels for 2016, we are projected to incur approximately $15 million in deficiency fees related to these delivery commitments.
912750_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_16_ITEM7_P78_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	_________________ (1) Our oil delivery commitments are with two Salt Lake City, Utah refiners and relate to our Uinta Basin production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	One delivery commitment is for approximately 18,000 barrels of oil per day through 2020.
912750_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	The second commitment is for 15,000 barrels of oil per day in January 2016, increasing to 20,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of the third quarter 2016, and continues at that level through August 2025.
912750_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_16_ITEM7_P80_S3	These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis.
912750_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	We use derivative contracts to manage the variability in cash flows caused by commodity price fluctuations associated with our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24 to 36 months.
912750_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities" below and "Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices" in Item 7A of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	See the discussion and tables in Note 4 , "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 5 , "Fair Value Measurements," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Between January 1, 2016 and February 19, 2016 , we did not enter into additional derivative contracts.
912750_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	See Note 1 , Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full description of the critical accounting policies and estimates below, as well as other accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.
912750_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Two generally accepted accounting methods are available for accounting for oil and gas producing activities successful efforts and full cost.
912750_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	The most significant differences between these methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying values of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment.
912750_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while these costs are capitalized under the full cost method.
912750_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	Both methods provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two-step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to assess for impairment.
912750_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	If required, the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward-looking prices.
912750_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the after-tax carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the after-tax net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using SEC pricing, costs in effect at year-end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method.
912750_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Proved Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves.
912750_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	Our engineering estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including DD A expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	gas and NGL reserves are the estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on SEC pricing and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	Changes in commodity prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir will result in future revisions to our estimated proved reserves quantities.
912750_16_ITEM7_P94_S4	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Under the full cost method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into country-based cost centers .
912750_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied as a reduction of the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	Future development and abandonment costs are added, and unevaluated costs are withheld from the net costs capitalized in cost centers to represent a full cost pool, which is amortized and assessed for impairment.
912750_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Future development costs include expected costs to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our gathering systems, production platforms and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	We estimate these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and information from our engineering consultants.
912750_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimation is difficult and requires judgments that are subject to revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs annually, or more frequently if circumstances change.
912750_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability and corresponding long-lived asset for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred.
912750_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	The liability is increased to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	To change our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2015 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.17 per BOE, which would require a change in estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 4%, or $87 million.
912750_16_ITEM7_P99_S3	Our China DD A rate would need to change by $1.99 per BOE, which would require a change in estimate of our China future development and abandonment costs of approximately 499%, or $23 million.
912750_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base.
912750_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_16_ITEM7_P100_S4	Currently, there are no unevaluated properties for our China business.
912750_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage.
912750_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	At December 31, 2015 , we had a total of $780 million of costs excluded from the respective full cost pools, all of which related to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	Inclusion of some or all of these costs in our domestic full cost pool, without adding any associated reserves, would have resulted in additional ceiling test writedowns.
912750_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The full cost pool for each country is amortized using a unit-of-production method based on the cost center's proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.
912750_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Estimated proved reserves are a significant component of the calculation of DD A expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown.
912750_16_ITEM7_P103_S2	To change our diluted earnings per share for continuing operations by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2015 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.17 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 2%, or 8 MMBOE.
912750_16_ITEM7_P103_S3	Our China DD A rate would need to change by $1.99 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our China proved reserves of approximately 8%, or 1 MMBOE.
912750_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of oil and gas property costs that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	The ceiling value of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is calculated based on SEC pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Once recorded, a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	Holding all other factors constant, it is likely that we will experience a ceiling test writedown in both the U.S. and China in the first quarter of 2016.
912750_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating and development costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds and tax attributes.
912750_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, we believe that impairments in the first quarter of 2016 could exceed $500 million .
912750_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	We monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
912750_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date.
912750_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date.
912750_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties.
912750_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as goodwill.
912750_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain.
912750_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	The value allocated to recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling above.
912750_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	The accounting standard for business combinations establishes how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
912750_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction.
912750_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	However, we do not designate any of our derivative contracts as accounting hedges.
912750_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had net derivative assets of $367 million , of which 71%, based on total contracted volumes, was measured based upon a modified Black-Scholes valuation model and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than the fair value as of December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	For further discussion of our derivative instruments and activities, see "Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices," in Item 7A of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	Also see Note 4 , "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 5 , "Fair Value Measurements," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_16_ITEM7_P116_S3	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_16_ITEM7_P116_S4	See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires significant judgment by management and is reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances.
912750_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the related deferred tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Changes in judgment regarding future realizability of deferred tax assets may result in the reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.
912750_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	In the period that determination is made, our net income will benefit from a lower effective tax rate.
912750_16_ITEM7_P121_S3	See Note 7 , Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of income taxes.
912750_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of new accounting requirements.
912750_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Exploration, development, production and the sale of oil, gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation.
912750_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_16_ITEM7_P123_S4	Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business," in Item 1A of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to enter into derivative contracts is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While the use of derivative contracts can limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In addition, the use of derivative contracts may involve basis risk.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	At December 31, 2015 , 10 of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our contracted volumes with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 15% .
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Of our expected 2016 crude oil production, 16,280 MBbls are partially protected against price volatility through the use of collars and swaps, all of which have associated sold puts.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average price of our sold puts of $74.47 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	If the market price remains below $74.47 per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.52 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	For 6,242 MBbls of our 2016 volumes, we have locked in an average minimum premium of $13.62 over the market price through the use of purchased calls.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S4	The weighted average strike price of the purchased calls approximates the weighted average strike price of the sold puts, thereby effectively locking in the value.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S5	Of our expected 2017 crude oil production, 6,548 MBbls are partially protected against price volatility through the use of collars and swaps, all of which have associated sold puts.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S6	The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average price of our sold puts of $73.83 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P4_S7	If the market price remains below $73.83 per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.06 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	over the market price through the use of purchased calls.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	For further discussion of our derivative instruments and activities, see Note 4 , Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2015 , our debt was comprised of:
912750_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 98% of our obligations were at fixed rates as of December 31, 2015 , and our variable rate debt was at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 2%.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A 10% increase in LIBOR would not materially impact our interest costs on debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 , but would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	To the extent that business transactions in a foreign country are not denominated in the U.S. dollar, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_16_ITEM7A_P8_S3	We did not have any open derivative contracts related to foreign currencies at December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), the management of our Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newfield Exploration Company:
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_16_ITEM8_P6_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).
912750_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our operations are focused primarily on large scale, onshore liquids-rich resource plays in the United States.
912750_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Our principal areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota, the Uinta Basin of Utah and the Maverick and Gulf Coast basins of Texas.
912750_16_ITEM8_P14_S3	In addition, we have oil developments offshore China.
912750_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_16_ITEM8_P15_S2	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to Newfield, we, us, our or the Company are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	Other risks and uncertainties that could affect us in the current price environment include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, responsibility for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own, access to credit markets and ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing impairment of our oil and gas properties.
912750_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
912750_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Our most significant estimates are associated with the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the timing and amount of transfers of our unevaluated properties into our amortizable full cost pool, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the fair value of both our derivative contracts and our stock-based compensation liability awards.
912750_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Restructuring costs include severance and related benefit costs, costs associated with abandoned office space, employee relocation costs and other associated costs.
912750_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Employee severance and related benefit costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period, if any.
912750_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Employee relocation costs are expensed as incurred.
912750_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	On the date a leased property ceases to be used, a liability for non-cancellable office-lease costs associated with restructuring is recognized and measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Fair value estimates include assumptions regarding estimated future sublease payments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	These estimates could materially differ from actual results and may require revision to initial estimates of the liability.
912750_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	See Note 16 , "Restructuring Costs," for additional disclosures.
912750_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Certain reclassifications were made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	These reclassifications did not impact our net income (loss), stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company's production and other taxes for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were reduced by approximately $ 7 million in the fourth quarter due to an adjustment related to our 2013 and 2014 severance tax returns.
912750_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company does not believe the correcting adjustments are material to these consolidated financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	See Note 19 , "Discontinued Operations," for additional disclosures, as well as information regarding the sale of our Malaysia business, which closed in February 2014.
912750_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	These financial statements and notes are inclusive of our Malaysia operations unless otherwise noted.
912750_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Substantially all of our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold at market-based prices to a variety of purchasers under short-term contracts (less than 12 months).
912750_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	We also have long-term contracts in the Uinta Basin at market-based prices, less a variable differential that becomes fixed below certain market price thresholds.
912750_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	Revenues from the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Under the sales method, the Company and other joint owners may sell more or less than their entitled share of production.
912750_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Should the Company s excess sales exceed our share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves, a liability is recorded.
912750_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Differences between sales and our entitled share of production are not material.
912750_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Gains and losses incurred on transactions in a currency other than the U.S. dollar are recorded under the caption Other income (expense) Other, net on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	We have restricted cash of $13 million included in "Other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 that represents amounts held in escrow accounts to satisfy future plug and abandonment obligations for our China operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released as we plug and abandon wells and facilities in our China field.
912750_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Consistent with our other plug and abandonment activities, changes in restricted cash are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
912750_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Investments consist of debt and equity securities, a majority of which are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value.
912750_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.
912750_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	We routinely assess material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.
912750_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected.
912750_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our China operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in China is produced into floating storage facilities and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated.
912750_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	The carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of related production costs and depletion expense.
912750_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	See Note 3 , "Inventories," for further discussion.
912750_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into country-based cost centers.
912750_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, we sold our Malaysia business, which constituted the entire full cost pool for Malaysia.
912750_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	See Note 19 , "Discontinued Operations," for further discussion.
912750_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	A particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess.
912750_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	If required, a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas and NGL prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period, or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base.
912750_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	See Note 6 , Oil and Gas Properties and Other Property and Equipment, for a detailed discussion regarding our oil and gas property and equipment, and our asset acquisitions and sales transactions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Gathering systems and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 25 years.
912750_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the ARO is incurred.
912750_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	Settlements include payments made to satisfy the AROs, as well as transfer of the AROs to purchasers of our divested properties.
912750_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	In general, the amount of the initial recorded ARO and the costs capitalized will equal the estimated future costs to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using the credit adjusted risk-free rate for our Company.
912750_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value and the original capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	See Note 9 , "Asset Retirement Obligations," for further discussion.
912750_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, liabilities and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
912750_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	We accrue for losses when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
912750_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	See Note 11 , Commitments and Contingencies, for a more detailed discussion regarding our contingencies.
912750_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed as incurred.
912750_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based upon evaluations of currently available facts related to each site.
912750_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	We also evaluate potential uncertain tax positions, and if necessary, establish accruals for such items.
912750_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	See Note 7 , "Income Taxes," for further discussion.
912750_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.
912750_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_16_ITEM8_P53_S3	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period.
912750_16_ITEM8_P53_S4	See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	Our joint interest owners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers whose ability to reimburse us could be negatively impacted by adverse market conditions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The purchasers of our oil, gas and NGL production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	All of our derivative transactions were carried out in the over-the-counter market and are not typically subject to margin-deposit requirements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	The counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	We monitor the credit ratings of our hedging counterparties on an ongoing basis.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	Although we have entered into derivative contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price volatility.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S4	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S5	At December 31, 2015 , 10 of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our contracted volumes, with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 15% .
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S6	Approximately 70% of our volumes subject to derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility.
912750_16_ITEM8_P57_S7	Our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd., MidCon Gathering LLC and Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC accounted for 13% , 11% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues in 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	During 2014 , Tesoro Corporation and Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC accounted for 12% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	During 2013 , sales of our oil and gas production to Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC, Royal Dutch Shell plc and Tesoro Corporation accounted for 13% , 12% and 11% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_16_ITEM8_P58_S3	We believe that the loss of any of our major customers would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are available.
912750_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Our derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.
912750_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	While we utilize our derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance.
912750_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities unless they are determined to have a significant financing element at inception, in which case they are classified within financing activities.
912750_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	See Note 4 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet accordingly.
912750_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	See Note 4 , "Derivative Financial Instruments," for details regarding the gross amounts, as well as the impact of our netting arrangements on our net derivative position.
912750_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	We only offset assets and liabilities in relation to our derivative financial instruments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance regarding the presentation of deferred income taxes in the balance sheet and requires that within a particular jurisdiction, deferred tax liabilities and assets, as well as any related valuation allowance, be offset and classified as a single noncurrent amount.
912750_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
912750_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	We early adopted this guidance in 2015 on a prospective basis as permitted by the guidance.
912750_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance regarding the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements and requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a reduction of the carrying value of the financial liability and not as a separate asset.
912750_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The guidance requires retrospective adjustment to the balance sheet presentation and disclosures applicable for a change in an accounting principle.
912750_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM8_P64_S3	We early adopted this guidance in 2015 as permitted by the guidance.
912750_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
912750_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	The guidance applies prospectively to all entities, requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose certain information when substantial doubt is raised.
912750_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
912750_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017.
912750_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
912750_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	The guidance may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit).
912750_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	In July 2015, the FASB approved a deferral of the effective date by one year.
912750_16_ITEM8_P66_S3	As a result, the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017.
912750_16_ITEM8_P66_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Reserve for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes an allowance for $15 million related to discontinued operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	During 2015 and 2014 , we had inventory writedowns of $5 million and $9 million , respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	These writedowns are included in Operating expenses Other on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	We had no inventory impairments in 2013.
912750_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the crude oil inventory from our China operations consisted of approximately 335,000 and 240,000 barrels of crude oil, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	We utilize the following derivative strategies, which consist of either a single derivative instrument or a combination of instruments, to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our domestic oil and natural gas production.
912750_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	With respect to a swap position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price.
912750_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Collars (combination of purchased put options (floor) and sold call options (ceiling)) .
912750_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	For a collar position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor strike price while we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling strike price.
912750_16_ITEM8_P72_S2	Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor strike price and equal to or less than the ceiling strike price.
912750_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	A swap with a sold put position consists of a standard swap position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the associated fixed-price swap.
912750_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	This structure enables us to increase the fixed-price swap with the value received through the sale of the put.
912750_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the put strike price, then we will only receive the difference between the swap price and the put strike price.
912750_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard swap only.
912750_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	A collar with a sold put position consists of a standard collar position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the floor strike price of the collar.
912750_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	This structure enables us to improve the collar strike prices with the value received through the sale of the additional put.
912750_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the additional put strike price, then we will receive the difference between the floor strike price and the additional put strike price.
912750_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar only.
912750_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	These purchased calls are options that require a counterparty to make a payment to us if the settlement price is above the call strike price (excluding the effects of deferred premium owed by us to the counterparty).
912750_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	As a result, these positions lock in the value of a portion of our corresponding oil swaps with sold puts as well as collars with sold puts.
912750_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	Our total deferred premium associated with these purchased calls was $22 million at December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	While the use of these derivative instruments may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk adjustments using credit default swaps, interest rates and time to maturity.
912750_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	The calculation of the fair value of options requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	See Note 5 , Fair Value Measurements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	At December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding derivative positions as set forth in the tables below.
912750_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	_________________ (1) If the market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the market price plus the following associated with our production:
912750_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	the difference between our swap price and our sold put price for fixed-price swaps with sold puts.
912750_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	For the volumes with purchased calls, we have effectively locked in a portion of the difference between the purchased call price and the sold put price noted above (less the deferred call premium).
912750_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in Commodity derivative income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity fixed-price swaps and certain investments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as commodity options (i.e., price collars, sold puts, purchased calls or swaptions) and other financial investments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models (i.e., Black-Scholes) that consider various inputs including: (a) forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	Our valuation model for the Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP) is a Monte Carlo simulation that is based on a probability model and considers various inputs including: (a) the measurement date stock price, (b) time value and (c) historical and implied volatility.
912750_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation, for a description of the SVAP.
912750_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
912750_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The determination of the fair values of our derivative contracts incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), if any.
912750_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to, and receivables from, counterparties.
912750_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
912750_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods.
912750_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	________ (1) During the second quarter of 2014, we transferred $3 million of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 hierarchy.
912750_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	The transfer was a result of our Level 3 swaptions being exercised by the counterparties as swaps on May 30, 2014.
912750_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, all auction rate securities that we held as of January 1, 2014, were sold for $39 million .
912750_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	Our valuation models for Level 3 derivative contracts are primarily industry-standard models that consider various factors, including certain significant unobservable inputs such as volatility factors and counterparty credit risk.
912750_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	compared to the strike prices fixed by our derivative contracts, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the contractual life are discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates.
912750_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Significant increases (decreases) in the quoted forward prices for commodities generally lead to corresponding decreases (increases) in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Significant changes in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	Historically, we have not experienced significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an investment grade credit rating.
912750_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	See Note 4 , "Derivative Financial Instruments," for additional discussion of our derivative instruments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The calculation of the fair value of the SVAP liability required the use of a probability-based Monte Carlo simulation, which included unobservable inputs.
912750_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	The simulation predicted multiple scenarios of future stock returns over the performance period, which were discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	The fair value was recognized over a service period derived from the simulation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P102_S3	The SVAP performance period ended December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as of December 31, was as follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	Any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	At December 31, oil and gas properties and other property and equipment consisted of the following:
912750_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Costs withheld from amortization as of December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:
912750_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	We capitalized approximately $107 million , $199 million and $198 million of interest and direct internal costs in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, we finalized a settlement agreement with our insurance carriers related to an August 2013 LF-7 topside incident in China and recorded a $57 million receivable (the Company's share) and associated reduction to capital expenditures.
912750_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	The settlement proceeds were collected in July 2015.
912750_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	At December 31, 2015 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $2.59 per MMBtu for natural gas and $50.11 per barrel for oil.
912750_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	Using these prices, our ceiling for the U.S. did not exceed the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties resulting in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_16_ITEM8_P109_S2	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded U.S. ceiling test writedowns of approximately $4.8 billion ( $3.3 billion after tax).
912750_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	Using SEC pricing, our ceiling for China at December 31, 2015 did not exceed the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, resulting in a ceiling test writedown.
912750_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded China ceiling test writedowns of approximately $118 million ( $60 million after tax).
912750_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	The continued decline of SEC pricing for oil and natural gas reserves subsequent to December 31, 2015, will likely result in additional ceiling test writedowns in 2016 and possibly thereafter.
912750_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	At December 31, 2014, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas and $94.98 per barrel for oil.
912750_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	At December 31, 2013, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.82 per barrel for oil.
912750_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	respect to our domestic and China full cost pools exceeded the net capitalized costs and no ceiling test writedowns were required at December 31, 2014 or 2013.
912750_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	In September 2014, we closed on the sale of our Granite Wash assets, located primarily in Texas, for approximately $588 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	The sale of our Granite Wash assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_16_ITEM8_P114_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Granite Wash operations through the date of sale.
912750_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $125 million , $33 million and $72 million , respectively, and sold certain other oil and gas properties for proceeds of approximately $90 million , $69 million and $36 million , respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	For the years ended December 31, income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	For the years ended December 31, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes for continuing operations consisted of the following:
912750_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate.
912750_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	Our effective tax rate for 2015 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to domestic and international deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in 2015 and discussed below.
912750_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we elected to have our China business treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which resulted in earnings and profits of our international business in China being taxed in both the United States and China.
912750_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Due to our net operating loss (NOL) carryforward position, we do not expect to be able to utilize related foreign tax credits (FTC) before they expire and accordingly we recorded a full valuation allowance against these credits.
912750_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	These FTCs are utilized in the alternative minimum tax system to reduce current cash taxes.
912750_16_ITEM8_P120_S3	The result is a high effective tax rate in periods, such as 2013, when our book income in China is high relative to our domestic book income.
912750_16_ITEM8_P120_S4	These effective tax rate fluctuations are magnified when income before taxes approaches zero.
912750_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	At December 31, the components of our deferred tax asset (liability) were as follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had gross NOL carryforwards of approximately $852 million and $573 million for federal income tax and $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion for state income tax purposes, respectively, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	At December 31, 2015 , our gross NOL included unrecognized net operating losses of $108 million related to stock-based compensation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P122_S2	NOL carryforwards of $155 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_16_ITEM8_P122_S3	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $61 million of our various gross state NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P122_S4	To the extent not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2035.
912750_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had foreign tax credits of approximately $ 572 million and $ 547 million, respectively, which will expire during the years 2022 through 2025.
912750_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing deferred tax assets.
912750_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	The change in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows at December 31:
912750_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	Due to the ceiling test writedowns of our oil and gas properties in 2015, we moved from a deferred tax liability position to a deferred tax asset position in various taxing jurisdictions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	With the current commodity price levels, we consider it more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized and therefore, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our domestic and China deferred tax assets of $202 million and $13 million, respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	As the result of the divestiture of the Malaysia operations in 2014, all of the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance were transferred to the buyer.
912750_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off the other international deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances since we have ceased operating in these jurisdictions and it is remote that the NOL carryforwards will be realized in the future.
912750_16_ITEM8_P128_S2	In fourth quarter of 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded valuation allowances related to insufficient estimated future domestic taxable income to fully utilize foreign tax credits before they expire of $ 25 million , $12 million , and $ 114 million , respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is fully offset by a valuation allowance.
912750_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did not accrue related interest or penalties.
912750_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	The tax years 2011 through 2015 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	Unrealized derivative gains and losses are treated differently for income tax purposes in the various state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate fluctuates in periods with significant commodity price volatility.
912750_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	These effective tax rate fluctuations are magnified when income before taxes approaches zero.
912750_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	The change in our ARO for continuing operations for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	_________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, additions include $28 million for our Pearl development in offshore China and $30 million for abandonment obligations in our domestic business.
912750_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	(2) For the year ended December 31, 2014, settlements include $10 million related to the sale of our Granite Wash assets.
912750_16_ITEM8_P134_S2	See Note 6 , Oil and Gas Properties and Other Property and Equipment.
912750_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	At December 31, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	_________________ (1) Because we have the ability and intent to use our available credit facility capacity to repay borrowings under our money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates, amounts outstanding under these obligations, if any, are classified as long-term.

912750_16_ITEM8_P140_S1	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately $5 million , $4 million and $3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which are recorded in Interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and ceiling test writedowns) to interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0.
912750_16_ITEM8_P141_S1	At December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

912750_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_16_ITEM8_P146_S3	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P146_S4	The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.

912750_16_ITEM8_P147_S3	In addition, unamortized offering costs of approximately $3 million were charged to interest expense as a result of the repayment.
912750_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	We have various commitments from continuing operations for firm transportation, operating lease agreements for office space and other agreements.
912750_16_ITEM8_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , future minimum payments under these non-cancelable agreements are as follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	Firm transportation is comprised of various agreements with third parties for oil and gas gathering and transportation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	Rent expense with respect to our lease commitments for office space for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $35 million , $20 million and $19 million , respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	Our other agreements are primarily other equipment leases.
912750_16_ITEM8_P150_S1	Payments under our drilling-related contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P151_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	_________________ (1) Our oil delivery commitments are with two Salt Lake City, Utah refiners and relate to our Uinta Basin production.
912750_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	One delivery commitment is for approximately 18,000 barrels of oil per day through 2020.
912750_16_ITEM8_P152_S2	The second commitment is for 15,000 barrels of oil per day in January 2016, increasing to 20,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of the third quarter 2016, and continues at that level through August 2025.
912750_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	Given the decline in oil and natural gas prices and the related impact on our 2016 planned capital investments, as well as the potential impact on development plans in future years, we could fail to deliver the minimum production required under these commitments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $3.50 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	In May 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the Company alleging certain plugging and abandonment predecessor-in-interest liabilities related to offshore assets sold by the Company in 2010.
912750_16_ITEM8_P154_S1	The lawsuit alleges damages of approximately $23 million .
912750_16_ITEM8_P154_S2	The Company has responded to the petition, denied the allegations and is vigorously defending the case.
912750_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	The Court has held that the Company must bear a "portion" of the plugging and abandonment costs, but the "exact percentage" of such costs should be determined in arbitration.
912750_16_ITEM8_P155_S1	The court case is stayed pending arbitration.
912750_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	An estimate of reasonably possible losses, if any, cannot be made at this time.
912750_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_16_ITEM8_P157_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P158_S0	At January 1, 2013, accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) included unrealized losses related to auction rate securities that were deemed to be temporary as the Company had the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
912750_16_ITEM8_P158_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company changed its intention and considered plans to sell the securities.
912750_16_ITEM8_P158_S2	As a result, the losses previously accumulated in AOCI related to these securities were transferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_16_ITEM8_P158_S3	During the first quarter of 2014, all auction rate securities were sold for $39 million .
912750_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	The change in AOCI for the indicated periods is set forth below:
912750_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, we issued 25.3 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering.
912750_16_ITEM8_P160_S1	We received net proceeds of approximately $815 million , which were used primarily to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit that were outstanding at that time.
912750_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	In May 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation that increased the total authorized shares of common stock from 200 million to 300 million shares.
912750_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	Upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we typically repurchase a portion of the vested shares for payment of employee tax withholding.
912750_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	Such repurchases are not part of a publicly announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock.
912750_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income, less any applicable adjustments, (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (excluding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	Diluted EPS incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	See Note 14 , Stock-Based Compensation.
912750_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for the indicated years:
912750_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	_________________ (1) The effect of unvested restricted stock awards or restricted stock units and stock options has not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2015 , as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	Had we recognized income from continuing operations for the year, incremental shares attributable to the assumed vesting of unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options would have increased diluted weighted-averages shares outstanding by 2.8 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
912750_16_ITEM8_P166_S2	(2) The effect of 1.1 million and 4.0 million unvested restricted stock awards or restricted stock units and stock options for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, have not been included in the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted EPS as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
912750_16_ITEM8_P166_S3	(3) The numerator includes an adjustment of $20 million related to the repurchase of preferred shares of a now wholly-owned subsidiary, which reduces net income (loss) for purposes of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013.
912750_16_ITEM8_P166_S4	The subsidiary is part of our continuing operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P166_S5	See Note 20 , "Related Party Transaction," for additional information.
912750_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	For the years ended December 31, our stock-based compensation expense consisted of the following:
912750_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $50 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards that vest within four years .
912750_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	Equity awards consist of service-based and performance- or market-based restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
912750_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	Stock-based compensation classified as equity awards are currently granted under the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended (2011 Plan), to employees and non-employee directors.
912750_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance- and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	Compensation expense for equity awards is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting periods.
912750_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	Shares available for grant under our 2011 Plan are reduced by 1.87 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_16_ITEM8_P172_S1	In May 2015, our stockholders approved an additional 7.0 million shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan, resulting in approximately (1) 7.3 million shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan if all future awards are stock options, or (2) 3.9 million additional shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan if all future awards are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_16_ITEM8_P172_S2	Thus far, all awards under our 2011 Plan have been granted as restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards.
912750_16_ITEM8_P172_S3	We utilize common shares when restricted stock awards are issued, options are exercised or restricted stock units vest.
912750_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	At December 31, 2015 , our employees held approximately 1.7 million shares of non-vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units.
912750_16_ITEM8_P173_S1	These shares primarily vest over three to five years and vesting is dependent upon the employee s continued service with our Company.
912750_16_ITEM8_P173_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2015 , our employees held approximately 1.1 million shares of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting criteria (all of which are currently considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	The following table provides information about restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit activity.
912750_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	The total fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $35 million , $43 million and $47 million , respectively.
912750_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	Options generally expire ten years from the grant date and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the grant date.
912750_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	We issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_16_ITEM8_P177_S1	No stock options have been granted since 2008, except for ESPP options as discussed in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan section below.
912750_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The following table below provides information about stock option activity.
912750_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	_________________ (1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of our common stock at the indicated date, or at the time of exercise, exceeds the exercise price of the option.
912750_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	On December 31, 2015 , the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $32.56 per share.

912750_16_ITEM8_P186_S2	The value of the awards, and the associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.

912750_16_ITEM8_P196_S6	Our contribution with respect to each participant in the deferred compensation plan is reduced by the amount of contribution made by us to our 401(k) plan for that participant.
912750_16_ITEM8_P196_S7	Our combined contributions to these two plans was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and $10 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	In April 2015, we announced plans to combine our onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain business units into our newly-created Western Region, which is managed from The Woodlands, Texas.
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S1	Our decision to restructure the organization, which only affected our domestic business, was primarily in response to the current oil and gas commodity price environment.
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S2	These changes better utilize our resources and improve cost efficiencies in operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S3	Substantially all one-time restructuring-related costs were incurred by December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S4	These costs did not materially affect our cash flows or results of operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S5	We abandoned our Denver, Colorado office space during the third quarter of 2015 and recorded a loss for the remaining contracted payments net of expected sublease income.
912750_16_ITEM8_P197_S6	We will close our North Houston (Greenspoint area) office in the first quarter of 2016.
912750_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	Restructuring costs recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31 are set forth below.
912750_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	The following table summarizes our restructuring costs and related accruals.
912750_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are organizationally structured along geographic operating segments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P200_S1	Our current operating segments are the United States and China.
912750_16_ITEM8_P200_S2	The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 , Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
912750_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
912750_16_ITEM8_P201_S1	Income tax allocations have been determined based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment.
912750_16_ITEM8_P201_S2	Our earnings and profits in China are taxed at the combined statutory rates for China and the U.S. for our income tax allocation of our China operations in the following tables.
912750_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes total assets from our discontinued operations of $ 916 million .
912750_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	The following table presents information about supplemental cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31:
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	In 2013, we met the criteria to classify our Malaysia business as held for sale and discontinued operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	In February 2014, we closed the sale of our Malaysia business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad (SapuraKencana), a Malaysian public company, for $898 million .
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S2	As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain in the first quarter of 2014 of approximately $388 million ( $252 million , after tax).
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an allowance against a receivable from SapuraKencana and reduced the previously recognized gain by $15 million ( $10 million , after tax) due to uncertainty associated with collectability.
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S4	In April 2015, we initiated a notice of dispute related to the final post-close settlement, which was countered by SapuraKencana.
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S5	We believe the dispute may result in arbitration proceedings.
912750_16_ITEM8_P204_S6	There are no other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet attributable to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.
912750_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	________________ (1) Certain payments to foreign governments made on our behalf that are part of the revenue process are recorded as a reduction of the related oil and gas revenues.
912750_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	Historically, our effective tax rate in Malaysia was approximately 38% .
912750_16_ITEM8_P206_S1	As a result of our December 2012 decision to repatriate earnings from our international operations, we experienced higher international effective tax rates due to these earnings being taxed in both the U.S. and the local country.
912750_16_ITEM8_P206_S2	The effective tax rate for our discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 37% , as the majority of our income from discontinued operations resulted from the gain on the sale of our Malaysia business, which was only taxable in the U.S.
912750_16_ITEM8_P206_S3	The effective tax rate for our discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 58% due to our international earnings being taxed in both the U.S and the local country.
912750_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	Kevin M. Robinson, our former Vice President Asia through February 10, 2014, and Susan G. Riggs, our current Treasurer, were minority owners of Huffco International L.L.C. (Huffco).
912750_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	In May 1997, before Mr. Robinson and Ms. Riggs joined the Company, we acquired from Huffco an entity now known as Newfield China, LDC, the owner of a 12% interest in a three-field unit located in Bohai Bay, offshore China.
912750_16_ITEM8_P208_S1	Huffco retained preferred shares of Newfield China that provided for dividend payments.
912750_16_ITEM8_P208_S2	During the third quarter of 2013, we purchased the outstanding preferred shares of Newfield China from Huffco for approximately $20 million , which was recorded as a charge against retained earnings.
912750_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	The results of operations by quarter for the indicated periods are as follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	_________________ (1) Oil, gas and NGL revenues and Income (loss) from operations are specific to our continuing operations.
912750_16_ITEM8_P210_S1	(2) Income (loss) from operations for each quarter of 2015 includes a full cost ceiling test writedown as follows (in millions):
912750_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	(3) The sum of the individual quarterly earnings (loss) per share may not agree with year-to-date earnings (loss) per share as each quarterly computation is based on the income or loss for that quarter and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter.
912750_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	(4) During the quarter ended March 31, 2014, we sold our Malaysia business and recorded a gain of approximately $388 million ( $252 million , after tax).
912750_16_ITEM8_P211_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2014, we reduced the previously recognized gain by $15 million ( $10 million , after tax) due to recording an allowance against a receivable.

912750_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	(2) Other items reducing the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties which are not included in total costs incurred are as follows:
912750_16_ITEM8_P215_S0	Capitalized costs for our oil and gas producing activities consisted of the following at the end of each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2015 :
912750_16_ITEM8_P216_S0	Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_16_ITEM8_P216_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P216_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_16_ITEM8_P217_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_16_ITEM8_P217_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into our reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.
912750_16_ITEM8_P217_S2	The technical employee responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, with more than 30 years of industry experience (including over 20 years of experience in reserve estimation).
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	Our reserves estimates are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data.
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S1	These estimates, made by our petroleum engineering staff, are reviewed annually with management and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data.
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S2	The data reviewed includes, among other things, seismic data, well logs, production tests, reservoir pressures, and individual well and field performance data.
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S3	The data incorporated into our interpretations includes structure and isopach maps, individual well and field performance and other engineering and geological work products such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field projections.
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S4	Additionally, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices factor into estimating quantities of reserves.
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S5	Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental regulations, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with development drilling.
912750_16_ITEM8_P218_S6	Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner.
912750_16_ITEM8_P219_S0	The following is a discussion of our proved reserves and reserve additions and revisions.
912750_16_ITEM8_P220_S0	Our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year-end 2015 were 207 million barrels compared to 301 million barrels and 270 million barrels at year-end 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

912750_16_ITEM15_P193_S1	Based on the estimates of total net proved reserves prepared by Newfield, the reserves audit conducted by Ryder Scott addresses 61 percent of the total proved developed net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, 12 percent of the total proved developed net gas reserves, 26 percent of the total proved undeveloped net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, and 9 percent of the total proved undeveloped net gas reserves of Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P193_S2	On a barrel of oil equivalency basis, where 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas equal one barrel of oil equivalent, the properties reviewed by Ryder Scott represent 92% of Newfield s Western Region total net proved reserves and 64% of Newfield s International Region total net proved reserves.

912750_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	The estimated reserves presented in this report are related to hydrocarbon prices.
912750_16_ITEM15_P197_S1	Newfield has informed us that in the preparation of their reserve and income projections, as of December 31, 2015, they used average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P197_S2	Actual future prices may vary significantly from the prices required by SEC regulations; therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report.
912750_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	The net reserves as estimated by Newfield attributable to Newfield's interest in properties that we reviewed and for those that we did not review are summarized as follows:
912750_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in standard 42 gallon barrels and shown herein as thousand of barrels (MBBLS).
912750_16_ITEM15_P199_S1	All gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
912750_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
912750_16_ITEM15_P200_S1	An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled Petroleum Reserves Definitions is included as an attachment to this report.
912750_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	The various proved reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled Petroleum Reserves Status Definitions and Guidelines in this report.
912750_16_ITEM15_P201_S1	The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in and behind pipe categories.
912750_16_ITEM15_P201_S2	The Greater Monument Butte Unit in Utah also includes, as proved developed non-producing reserves, certain volumes attributable to future waterflood response in developed areas of the unit where water injection is ongoing or where the conversion of additional existing wells to injection is scheduled.
912750_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P202_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
912750_16_ITEM15_P202_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
912750_16_ITEM15_P202_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
912750_16_ITEM15_P202_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
912750_16_ITEM15_P202_S5	At Newfield s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
912750_16_ITEM15_P203_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward.
912750_16_ITEM15_P203_S1	The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods.
912750_16_ITEM15_P204_S0	The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.
912750_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	Proved reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
912750_16_ITEM15_P206_S0	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
912750_16_ITEM15_P206_S1	Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
912750_16_ITEM15_P206_S2	Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
912750_16_ITEM15_P207_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P207_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
912750_16_ITEM15_P208_S0	The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures.
912750_16_ITEM15_P208_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
912750_16_ITEM15_P208_S2	These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P209_S0	available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
912750_16_ITEM15_P210_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
912750_16_ITEM15_P211_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P211_S1	If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category assigned by the evaluator.
912750_16_ITEM15_P211_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable and/or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
912750_16_ITEM15_P212_S0	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely than not to be achieved.
912750_16_ITEM15_P212_S1	The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
912750_16_ITEM15_P212_S2	The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P212_S3	All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
912750_16_ITEM15_P213_S0	Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available.
912750_16_ITEM15_P213_S1	Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein.
912750_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	The proved reserves, prepared by Newfield, for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a combination of methods.
912750_16_ITEM15_P214_S1	Approximately 94 percent of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods.
912750_16_ITEM15_P214_S2	These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data ending over a range from August through November 2015, depending on the availability for a given case and in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
912750_16_ITEM15_P214_S3	The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder Scott by Newfield or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
912750_16_ITEM15_P214_S4	The remaining six percent of the proved producing reserves that we reviewed were estimated by the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods.
912750_16_ITEM15_P214_S5	These methods were used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate.
912750_16_ITEM15_P215_S0	All of the proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by analogy.
912750_16_ITEM15_P215_S1	The data utilized from the analogues were provided to Ryder Scott by Newfield or were obtained by us from public data sources that were available through November 2015.
912750_16_ITEM15_P215_S2	The data utilized from the analogues and incorporated into our analysis were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
912750_16_ITEM15_P216_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves, many factors and assumptions are considered including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
912750_16_ITEM15_P217_S0	Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_16_ITEM15_P217_S1	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in conducting this review.
912750_16_ITEM15_P218_S0	As stated previously, proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_16_ITEM15_P218_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Newfield relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
912750_16_ITEM15_P219_S0	The hydrocarbon prices furnished by Newfield for the properties reviewed by us are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P219_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
912750_16_ITEM15_P219_S2	Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described.
912750_16_ITEM15_P220_S0	The initial SEC hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2015 for the properties reviewed by us were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold.
912750_16_ITEM15_P220_S1	These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein.
912750_16_ITEM15_P220_S2	The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used by Newfield for the geographic area(s) reviewed by us.
912750_16_ITEM15_P221_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P222_S0	The product prices which were actually used by Newfield to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, certain handling and processing fees, certain oil transportation costs, and/or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
912750_16_ITEM15_P222_S1	The differentials used by Newfield were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P223_S0	The table below summarizes Newfield s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Newfield s average realized prices.
912750_16_ITEM15_P223_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Newfield s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Newfield s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
912750_16_ITEM15_P223_S2	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
912750_16_ITEM15_P224_S0	The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in Newfield s individual property evaluations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P225_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved gas reserve estimates reviewed.
912750_16_ITEM15_P225_S1	The proved gas volumes presented herein include volumes of gas consumed in operations as reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P225_S2	These volumes have been offset with gas price reductions equivalent to the value of the consumed gas.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S0	Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report were provided by Newfield and were represented to be based on their operating expense reports and to include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the COPAS overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S4	In the case of the international properties located offshore in the South China Sea, the cost recoverable expense and investment amounts have been deducted according to the terms of the Production Sharing Contracts.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S5	Furthermore, certain Windfall Profits Levy and Export Duty costs are included as Operating Cost deductions.
912750_16_ITEM15_P226_S6	For various U.S. properties, certain transportation, processing and handling fees which are separate for those mentioned above as price differentials are included as Other deductions.
912750_16_ITEM15_P227_S0	The operating costs provided to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the operating cost data used by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P227_S1	No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells.
912750_16_ITEM15_P228_S0	Development costs furnished by Newfield are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
912750_16_ITEM15_P228_S1	The development costs furnished by Newfield were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P228_S2	The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included by Newfield for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were significant.
912750_16_ITEM15_P228_S3	Newfield s estimates of the net abandonment costs were accepted without independent verification.
912750_16_ITEM15_P229_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us have been incorporated herein in accordance with Newfield s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM15_P229_S1	The implementation of Newfield s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Newfield s management.
912750_16_ITEM15_P229_S2	As the result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Newfield has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Newfield s management at the appropriate local, regional and/or corporate level.
912750_16_ITEM15_P229_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P229_S4	Additionally, Newfield has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
912750_16_ITEM15_P229_S5	While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2015, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P230_S0	Current costs used by Newfield were held constant throughout the life of the properties.
912750_16_ITEM15_P231_S0	Newfield s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
912750_16_ITEM15_P231_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
912750_16_ITEM15_P231_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P231_S3	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
912750_16_ITEM15_P232_S0	Test data and other related information were used by Newfield to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
912750_16_ITEM15_P232_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P232_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Newfield s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
912750_16_ITEM15_P232_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
912750_16_ITEM15_P233_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions, producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
912750_16_ITEM15_P234_S0	Certain proved reserves associated with Newfield s international assets reported herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production, unless evidence indicates that contract renewal is reasonably certain.
912750_16_ITEM15_P234_S1	Furthermore, properties in the different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Newfield for the production of these volumes.
912750_16_ITEM15_P234_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
912750_16_ITEM15_P234_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Newfield the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
912750_16_ITEM15_P234_S4	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
912750_16_ITEM15_P234_S5	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Newfield s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
912750_16_ITEM15_P235_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Newfield operates or has interests.
912750_16_ITEM15_P236_S0	Newfield s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P236_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax, and foreign trade and investment and are subject to change from time to time.
912750_16_ITEM15_P236_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities.
912750_16_ITEM15_P237_S0	The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a review of the properties in which Newfield owns and derives an interest; however, we have not made any field examination of the properties.
912750_16_ITEM15_P237_S1	No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included by Newfield for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
912750_16_ITEM15_P238_S0	Certain technical personnel of Newfield are responsible for the preparation of reserve estimates on new properties and for the preparation of revised estimates, when necessary, on old properties.
912750_16_ITEM15_P238_S1	These personnel assembled the necessary data and maintained the data and workpapers in an orderly manner.
912750_16_ITEM15_P238_S2	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our audit.
912750_16_ITEM15_P239_S0	Newfield has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P240_S0	with respect to property interests owned or derived, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, Production Sharing Contract terms, recompletion and development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, seismic analyses, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P240_S1	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P240_S2	We consider the factual data furnished to us by Newfield to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of Newfield s estimates of reserves and future net income.
912750_16_ITEM15_P240_S3	In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Newfield and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
912750_16_ITEM15_P241_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Newfield, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Newfield in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Newfield are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards.
912750_16_ITEM15_P242_S0	We were in reasonable agreement with Newfield's estimates of proved reserves for the properties which we reviewed; although in certain cases there was more than an acceptable variance between Newfield's estimates and our estimates due to a difference in interpretation of data or due to our having access to data which were not available to Newfield when its reserve estimates were prepared.
912750_16_ITEM15_P242_S1	However not withstanding, it is our opinion that on an aggregate basis the data presented herein for the properties that we reviewed fairly reflects the estimated net reserves owned by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P243_S0	Other properties, as used herein, are those properties of Newfield which we did not review.
912750_16_ITEM15_P243_S1	The proved net reserves attributable to the other properties account for 53 percent of the total proved net liquid hydrocarbon reserves and 89 percent of the total proved net gas reserves based on estimates prepared by Newfield as of December 31, 2015.

912750_16_ITEM15_P259_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
912750_16_ITEM15_P259_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
912750_16_ITEM15_P259_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
912750_16_ITEM15_P260_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
912750_16_ITEM15_P260_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
912750_16_ITEM15_P261_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P261_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
912750_16_ITEM15_P261_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
912750_16_ITEM15_P261_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
912750_16_ITEM15_P261_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
912750_16_ITEM15_P262_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
912750_16_ITEM15_P262_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
912750_16_ITEM15_P263_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
912750_16_ITEM15_P264_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
912750_16_ITEM15_P264_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
912750_16_ITEM15_P264_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
912750_16_ITEM15_P264_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
912750_16_ITEM15_P265_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P266_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
912750_16_ITEM15_P267_S0	centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
912750_16_ITEM15_P267_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
912750_16_ITEM15_P268_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
912750_16_ITEM15_P269_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
912750_16_ITEM15_P270_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
912750_16_ITEM15_P271_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_16_ITEM15_P271_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
912750_16_ITEM15_P272_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
912750_16_ITEM15_P272_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
912750_16_ITEM15_P272_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
912750_16_ITEM15_P273_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_16_ITEM15_P274_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P274_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
912750_16_ITEM15_P275_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
912750_16_ITEM15_P276_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
912750_16_ITEM15_P277_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_16_ITEM15_P278_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_16_ITEM15_P279_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
912750_16_ITEM15_P280_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_16_ITEM15_P280_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_16_ITEM15_P281_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
912750_16_ITEM15_P281_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
912750_16_ITEM15_P282_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_16_ITEM15_P283_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
912750_16_ITEM15_P284_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
912750_16_ITEM15_P285_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
912750_16_ITEM15_P286_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
912750_16_ITEM15_P287_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P288_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P289_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
912750_16_ITEM15_P290_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
912750_16_ITEM15_P291_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
912750_16_ITEM15_P292_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_16_ITEM15_P293_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
912750_16_ITEM15_P294_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
912750_16_ITEM15_P295_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
912750_16_ITEM15_P296_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
912750_16_ITEM15_P297_S0	January 20, 2016 Exhibit 99.2 Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent Inc.
912750_16_ITEM15_P298_S0	One Williams Center Suite 1900 Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172 Ladies and Gentlemen:
912750_16_ITEM15_P298_S1	Pursuant to your request, we have conducted an audit of the estimates of the net proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas reserves, as of December 31, 2015, prepared by the engineering staff of Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent Inc. (Newfield) for working and royalty interests in Oklahoma that Newfield has represented it owns.
912750_16_ITEM15_P298_S2	This evaluation was completed on January 20, 2016.
912750_16_ITEM15_P298_S3	Newfield has represented to us that these properties account for approximately 95 percent on a net equivalent barrel basis of Newfield s net proved reserves as of December 31, 2015, and that the net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States.
912750_16_ITEM15_P298_S4	We have reviewed information provided to us by Newfield that it represents to be Newfield s estimates of the net reserves, as of December 31, 2015, for the same properties as those which we evaluated.
912750_16_ITEM15_P298_S5	This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P299_S0	Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves as represented by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P299_S1	Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2015.
912750_16_ITEM15_P299_S2	Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by Newfield after deducting all interests owned by others.
912750_16_ITEM15_P300_S0	Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and gas reserves should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available.
912750_16_ITEM15_P300_S1	Not only are such reserves estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
912750_16_ITEM15_P301_S0	Data used in this audit were obtained from reviews with Newfield personnel, from Newfield files, from records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources.
912750_16_ITEM15_P301_S1	In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Newfield with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented.
912750_16_ITEM15_P301_S2	It was not considered necessary to make a field examination of the physical condition and operation of the properties.
912750_16_ITEM15_P302_S0	Methodology and Procedures Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).
912750_16_ITEM15_P302_S1	The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
912750_16_ITEM15_P303_S0	Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by Newfield, and the analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved.
912750_16_ITEM15_P304_S0	For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships.
912750_16_ITEM15_P304_S1	In the analyses of production decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production.
912750_16_ITEM15_P305_S0	In certain cases, when the previously named methods could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available.
912750_16_ITEM15_P306_S0	Petroleum reserves estimated by Newfield and by us are classified as proved and are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment.
912750_16_ITEM15_P307_S0	In the course of our audit of the estimates of net proved reserves prepared by Newfield, we have participated in reviews and discussions with Newfield involving Newfield s methodologies and procedures and we are in concurrence with the methodologies and procedures used by Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P308_S0	Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S0	Sales gas is defined as that portion of the total gas to be delivered into a gas pipeline for sale after separation, processing, fuel use, and flare.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S1	Gas reserves are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at a pressure base of 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S2	Gas quantities included herein are expressed in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf).
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S3	Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are those to be recovered by conventional lease separation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S4	NGL reserves are those attributed to the leasehold interests according to processing agreements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S5	Oil, condensate, and NGL reserves estimates included herein are expressed in terms of barrels (bbl) representing 42 United States gallons per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S6	Definition of Reserves Petroleum reserves estimated by Newfield included in this report are classified as proved.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S7	Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report.
912750_16_ITEM15_P309_S8	Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC.
912750_16_ITEM15_P310_S0	Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment.
912750_16_ITEM15_P310_S1	In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_16_ITEM15_P310_S2	The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
912750_16_ITEM15_P311_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.

912750_16_ITEM15_P325_S0	The following economic assumptions were used for estimating existing and future prices and costs: Oil, Condensate, and NGL Prices Newfield has represented that the oil, condensate, and NGL prices were based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P325_S1	The oil, condensate, and NGL prices were calculated using differentials furnished by Newfield to the reference price of $50.11 per barrel.
912750_16_ITEM15_P325_S2	The resulting volume-weighted average price was $47.33 per barrel of oil and condensate and $16.15 per barrel of NGL.
912750_16_ITEM15_P326_S0	Gas Prices Newfield has represented that the gas prices were based on Henry Hub pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_16_ITEM15_P326_S1	The gas prices were calculated for each property using differentials furnished by Newfield to the reference price of $2.59 per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and held constant thereafter.
912750_16_ITEM15_P326_S2	The resulting volume-weighted average price was $2.416 per thousand cubic feet.
912750_16_ITEM15_P327_S0	Production Taxes Production taxes were calculated using the tax rates for Oklahoma.
912750_16_ITEM15_P328_S0	Operating expenses and capital costs, based on information provided by Newfield, were used in estimating future costs required to operate the properties.
912750_16_ITEM15_P328_S1	In certain cases, future costs, either higher or lower than existing costs, may have been used because of anticipated changes in operating conditions.
912750_16_ITEM15_P328_S2	Abandonment costs were included for all properties.
912750_16_ITEM15_P328_S3	These costs were not escalated for inflation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P329_S0	While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant s ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the December 31, 2015, estimated oil and gas reserves.
912750_16_ITEM15_P330_S0	Newfield has represented that estimated net proved reserves attributable to the reviewed properties are based on the definitions of proved reserves of the SEC.
912750_16_ITEM15_P330_S1	Newfield has represented that its estimates of the net proved reserves attributable to these properties, which represent 95 percent of Newfield s total proved reserves on a net equivalent basis, are as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf), and thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe):
912750_16_ITEM15_P331_S0	In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves of oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, and 932-235-50-9 of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932): Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S K of the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided, however, that estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year.
912750_16_ITEM15_P332_S0	To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.
912750_16_ITEM15_P333_S0	In comparing the detailed net proved reserves estimates prepared by us and by Newfield of the properties audited, we have found differences, both positive and negative, resulting in an aggregate difference of 3.12 percent for the properties audited when compared on the basis of net barrels equivalent.
912750_16_ITEM15_P333_S1	It is our opinion that there is no material difference between the net proved reserves estimates prepared by Newfield and those prepared by us for those properties we audited.

912750_16_ITEM15_P334_S1	DeGolyer and MacNaughton does not have any financial interest, including stock ownership, in Newfield.
912750_16_ITEM15_P334_S2	Our fees were not contingent on the results of our evaluation.
912750_16_ITEM15_P334_S3	This letter report has been prepared at the request of Newfield.

912750_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our revenues, profitability, cash flows and future growth, as well as liquidity and ability to access additional sources of capital, depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Sustained lower prices will reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce and may result in further impairments of our proved reserves or reduction of our proved undeveloped reserves.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Oil, natural gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	See Items 1 and 2, " Business and Properties 2017 Outlook," for additional information about the commodity price environment.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some, but not all, of the factors that can cause fluctuations include:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	While we cannot predict commodity prices, we have made adjustments in response to the current strong supply and relatively soft demand, such as adapting our 2017 capital investment plan to reflect anticipated commodity prices, historical drilling success, and markets for our products.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These adjustments are likely to influence our profitability and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, our stock price in the market is influenced by fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Sustained material declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may have the following effects on our business:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	reduce the carrying value of our assets in our balance sheet through ceiling test impairments.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may be responsible for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Under state and federal law, oil and gas companies are obligated to plug and abandon (P A) a well and restore the lease to pre-operating conditions after operations cease.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	U.S. state and federal regulations allow the government to call upon predecessors in interest of oil and gas leases to pay for P A, restoration and decommissioning obligations if the current operator fails to fulfill those obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Moreover, offshore P A liabilities can be very significant.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	As part of our strategic shift from offshore Gulf of Mexico operations to onshore U.S. operations, we divested our assets on the outer continental shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).
912750_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In connection with those divestitures, we entered into various arrangements with the purchasers whereby the purchasers assumed our P A liabilities and other liabilities related to decommissioning such GoM assets.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Since we began our strategic shift, several onshore and offshore E P companies have sought bankruptcy protection.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	For example, in 2012 an offshore operator entered bankruptcy proceedings and sought to discharge its P A liabilities in bankruptcy.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The bankruptcy court allowed the discharge because the government identified a predecessor in interest of the lease to perform the P A obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The predecessor in interest was forced to accept P A liabilities estimated at over $100 million.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If purchasers of our former GoM assets, or any successor owners of those assets, are unable to meet their P A and other decommissioning obligations due to bankruptcy, dissolution or other related liquidity issues, we may be unable to rely on our arrangements with them to fulfill (or provide reimbursement for) those obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In those circumstances, the government may seek to impose the bankrupt entity s P A obligations on us and any other predecessors in interest.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Such payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Moreover, recent changes to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management s (BOEM) bonding requirements have the potential to adversely impact the financial condition of operators in the GoM and increase the number of operators seeking bankruptcy protection, given the current commodities market.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In July 2016, BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) that augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees, among others, to assure that sufficient funds are available to perform decommissioning obligations with respect to offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The NTL, which became effective in September 2016, eliminates the agency s past practice of waiving supplemental bonding obligations where a company could demonstrate a certain level of financial strength.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Instead, BOEM will allow companies to "self-insure," but only up to 10% of a company s "tangible net worth," which is defined as the difference between a company s total assets and the value of all liabilities and intangible assets.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P7_S7	The NTL provides new procedures for how BOEM determines a lessee s decommissioning obligations, and the agency continues to negotiate with offshore operators to post additional financial assurance and develop tailored plans to meet BOEM s revised estimates for offshore decommissioning obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Projected decommissioning costs of operations in the GoM continue to increase, and the volatile price of oil and gas has adversely affected the net worth of many operators.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	BOEM s revisions to its supplemental bonding process could result in demands for the posting of increased financial assurance by the entities to whom we divested our GoM assets as well as other operators in the GoM. This will force operators to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the costs of which could be significant.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Moreover, BOEM s NTL is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which will in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, exceed the surety bond market s ability to provide such additional financial assurance.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the volatile oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety may have about the priority of their lien on the operators' collateral.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Consequently, BOEM s changes could result in additional operators in the GoM initiating bankruptcy proceedings, which in turn could result in the government seeking to impose P A costs on predecessors in interest in the event that the current operator cannot meet its P A obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	As a result, we could find ourselves liable to pay for the P A costs of any entity we divested our GoM assets to, which payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity in Oklahoma and elsewhere could increase our costs of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Water sourcing, use and disposal are common practices in oil and gas operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We dispose of large volumes of water produced alongside oil and natural gas produced water or "saltwater" in connection with our drilling and production operations, pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	While these permits are issued under existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There exists a growing concern that the injection of produced water into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic events in certain areas, including Oklahoma, where we operate.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In response to recent seismic events near underground water disposal wells, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether certain high volume disposal wells have caused or contributed to increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells that are located in close proximity to areas of increased seismic activity.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) evaluates existing disposal wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to faults, seismicity and other factors, with well operators in certain geographic locations required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, the OCC has adopted rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct additional mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells to shallower depths and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within Areas of Interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	For example, OCC has established a 15 thousand square mile Area of Interest in the Arbuckle formation located primarily north and east of the Anadarko Basin in the Mississippi Lime play.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Since 2013, OCC has prohibited disposal into the basement rock and ordered reduction of disposal volumes into the overlying Arbuckle formation and directed the shut-in of a number of Arbuckle disposal wells in response to seismic activity.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, in January 2016, the Governor of Oklahoma announced a grant of $1.4 million in emergency funds to support earthquake research to be directed by the OCC and the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS).
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	During September and November 2016, in response to the occurrence of earthquakes in Cushing and Pawnee, Oklahoma, located in the northeast area of the Anadarko Basin, the OCC developed action plans in conjunction with the OGS and the EPA.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The plans require reductions in disposal volumes in three concentric zones from the center of the earthquake activity in both Cushing and Pawnee, Oklahoma, with the greatest reductions in the zone located closest to the center of the largest quakes.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These actions are in addition to any previous orders to shut in wells or reduce disposal volumes.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Prior measures had already reduced disposal volumes in the areas of concern by up to 50 percent for some disposal wells.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In the Pawnee area, the action plan covers a total of 38 Arbuckle disposal wells under OCC jurisdiction and 26 Arbuckle disposal wells under EPA jurisdiction and in the Cushing area the plan covers a total of 58 Arbuckle disposal wells.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Local residents have also recently filed lawsuits against saltwater disposal well operators in these areas for damages resulting from the increased seismic activity.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Additionally, in recent years there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to induce seismic events.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S7	For example, in July 2016, the OCC announced an investigation of all oil and gas activity, not solely disposal wells, in the Blanchard, Oklahoma area and other areas, in response to recent seismic activity in those areas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P12_S8	More recently, in December 2016, the OCC announced the development of seismicity guidelines focused on operators in SCOOP and STACK to directly address concerns related to induced seismicity and hydraulic fracturing.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The OCC has established three action levels to be followed if events are detected at a M2.5 or above and within 1.24 miles (2 km) of hydraulic fracturing activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Restrictions on disposal well volumes or a lack of sufficient disposal wells, the filing of lawsuits, or curtailment or restrictions on oil and gas activity generally in response to concerns related to induced seismicity, could cause us to delay, curb or discontinue our exploration and development plans.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Increased costs associated with restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal or hydraulic fracturing, such as mandated produced water recycling in some portion or all of our operations or prohibitions on performing hydraulic fracturing in certain areas, may reduce our profitability.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These developments may result in additional levels of regulation, or increased complexity and costs with respect to existing regulations, that could lead to operational delays or increased operating and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our use of oil and natural gas price derivative contracts may limit future revenues and cash flows from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Any inability to maintain our current derivative positions in the future specifically could result in financial losses or could reduce our income and cash flows .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As part of our risk management program, we generally use derivative contracts to protect a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24 to 36 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production or market differentials.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A significant portion of our oil derivative contracts include sold puts.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the difference between our floors or swaps and the associated sold puts, limiting the downside protection of these contracts.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In the case of acquisitions, we may use derivative contracts to protect acquired production from commodity price volatility for a longer period.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	While the use of derivative contracts may limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the volume subject to derivative contracts, there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the derivative transactions or there are issues with regard to the legal enforceability of such instruments.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The use of derivative transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to perform their financial and other obligations under such transactions.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts, enter receivership or seek bankruptcy or similar protection, that could result in an economic loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Additionally, in the past we have concluded that utilizing derivative contracts to lock in historically low prices for oil and natural gas for some of our anticipated future production is not in the best interest of the Company, and we may come to that conclusion again in the future.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	As a result, a meaningful portion of our future oil production could remain unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If we are ultimately unable to, or choose not to, hedge additional expected oil production volumes for future periods, we will be subject to further potential commodity price volatility, which may result in lower than expected cash flows, revenues and income.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our limited ability to hedge our NGL production and commodity basis differentials could adversely impact our cash flows and revenue.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	A liquid, readily available and commercially viable market for hedging NGL and commodity basis differentials has not developed in the same way that exists for oil and natural gas priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	The current direct NGL and commodity basis differential hedging market is constrained in terms of price, volume, duration and number of counterparties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	This limits our ability to hedge our NGL production and price difference based on point of sale effectively or at all.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	As a result, currently, we directly hedge only our oil and natural gas production priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	If the current price levels for NGL continue or decrease in the future or the commodity basis differentials versus WTI or Henry Hub negatively increase, such as is the case with respect to our wax crude oil production, our cash flows and results of operations would be affected.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S12	We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that could be greater than cash flows from operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S14	Although we have set our capital expenditures in 2017 to more closely align with our projected cash flows, we anticipate that our 2017 capital investment levels may exceed our projected cash flows from operations in 2017 .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P18_S15	As a result, we may use available cash or borrow funds under our credit facility, due in part to our decision to continue our drilling program in order to avoid future lease renewals to retain certain acreage.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	access public debt and/or equity markets to fund any shortfall.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our ability to generate operating cash flows is subject to many risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells; prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs; production costs; availability of economical gathering, processing, storage and transportation in our operating areas; our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, unbudgeted acquisitions and the promulgation of new regulatory requirements.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or changes in drilling plans.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Alternatively, we may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected, if:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	we are unable to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we had total indebtedness of $2.4 billion .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The indenture governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us and any future agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These restrictions and our level of indebtedness could limit our ability to:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions, and to comply with other covenants and restrictions in our financing agreements, can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile commodity cost environment or an economic downturn.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	This failure could impair our results of operations and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, or repay such debt with the proceeds from a sale of assets or a public offering of securities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Factors that will affect our ability to successfully complete a public offering, refinance our debt or conduct an asset sale include financial market conditions and our market value, asset valuations and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of capital or our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we were downgraded, it could be difficult for us to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	See Note 11 , " Debt ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex and inexact.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The process relies on interpretations of geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The extent, quality and reliability of these data can vary.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the effect of government regulation, taxes and availability of funds.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, effects of regulations, funding availability and drilling and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Any significant variance could be systematic and undetected for an extended period of time, which would materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	In addition, we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil, natural gas and NGL prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In accordance with SEC requirements, we calculate the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves using the SEC s pricing methodology for calculating proved reserves, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year end discounted at 10%.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used as of the date of an estimate.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, the decline in our reserves will eventually result in a decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL production and lower revenue, income and cash flows from operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test impairments in the past and may result in future ceiling test or other impairments .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test impairment to the extent of such excess.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If required, a ceiling test impairment reduces income and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The risk that we will be required to further impair the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas or NGL prices are low or volatile for a prolonged period of time.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In addition, impairments may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Drilling is a costly and high-risk activity .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil, natural gas or NGLs are present or may be produced economically.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Future drilling activities may not be successful, and if unsuccessful, this could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If any of these risks occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	repairs and remediation costs to resume operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Further, offshore operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoons or other adverse weather conditions.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our China operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Regions in which we operate have recently experienced drought conditions.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs related to finding alternative water sources.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses, as well as governmental fines and penalties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P41_S8	If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and in turn, our results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In connection with our operations, we generally require our contractors, which include the contractor, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliate companies, its subcontractors, their agents, employees, directors and officers, to agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees, contractors, subcontractors, agents and directors, and any property damage suffered by the contractors.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	litigation position, and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	While we maintain insurance against some potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The occurrence of any of the foregoing events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage or not indemnified, could reduce revenue, income and cash flows and the funds available to us for our exploration, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity, and other factors.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S6	If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling in these projects.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S7	Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S8	In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S9	As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S10	Currently low oil prices, reduced capital spending and numerous other factors, many of which are beyond our control, could result in our failure to establish production on undeveloped acreage, and, if we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S11	The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 65% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P44_S12	At that date, we had leases representing approximately 141,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2017 , approximately 95,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018 , and approximately 62,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2019 .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	At December 31, 2016 , approximately 39% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Our reserve estimates assume we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S6	These assumptions, however, may not prove to be accurate.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S7	We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled, or that the results of such development will be as estimated.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S8	If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S9	In addition, under the SEC s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S10	A removal of such reserves could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P45_S11	The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand or other proppant materials, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Certain municipalities have already banned hydraulic fracturing, and courts have upheld those moratoria in some instances.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	In the past several years, dozens of states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition " for more information on action taken by certain states to regulate hydraulic fracturing activity.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	At the federal level, the EPA has taken numerous actions, including the following: final federal Clean Air Act regulations in 2012 and, more recently, in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing, leak detection, and permitting; published in June 2016 an effluent limitation final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including, for example, notice to and pre approval by BLM of the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities; development and pre approval by BLM of a plan for managing and containing flowback fluids and produced water recovered during the hydraulic fracturing process; implementation of measures designed to protect usable water from hydraulic fracturing activities; and public disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	A final decision is pending, however.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	In addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The adoption of new federal rules or regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could require us to obtain additional permits or approvals or to install expensive pollution control equipment for our operations, which in turn could lead to increased operating costs, delays and curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which in turn could materially adversely affect our operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The final report concluded that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources "under some circumstances," noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, we do not believe that this multi-year study report provides any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S5	The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Development activities require the use of water.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	For example, the hydraulic fracturing process that we employ to produce commercial quantities of NGLs, natural gas and oil from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water in addition to the water we use to develop our waterflood in the GMBU.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In these cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the operating cost.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations, such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of NGLs, natural gas and oil.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In recent history, public concern surrounding increased seismicity has heightened focus on our industry s use of water in operations, which may cause increased costs, regulations or environmental initiatives impacting our use or disposal of water.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	activity in Oklahoma and elsewhere could increase our costs of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition " for more information on action taken by certain states to regulate hydraulic fracturing activity with respect to induced seismicity.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Furthermore, future environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells could cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, which may result in increased operating costs and have an effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We deliver oil, natural gas and NGLs through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements, third-party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	New regulations on the transportation of oil by rail, like those finalized by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2015, may increase our transportation costs.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S4	In addition, federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, infrastructure or capacity constraints and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S6	We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P55_S7	Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulation.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental, natural resource protection, and other governmental regulations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized a rule regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Matters subject to regulation include the following, in addition to the other matters discussed under the caption " Regulation " in Items 1 and 2 of this report:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource risk mitigation, damages and other environmental or habitat damages.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We also could be required to install and operate expensive pollution controls, engage in environmental risk management, incur increased waste disposal costs, or limit or even cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	of Engineers rule under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) defining the scope of the EPA s and the Corps jurisdiction became effective.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Removal of RCRA s exemption for exploration and production wastes has the potential to significantly increase our waste disposal costs, which in turn will result in increased operating costs and could adversely impact our results of operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	The matters described above and other potential legislative proposals, along with any applicable legislation introduced and passed in Congress or new rules or regulations promulgated by state or the US federal government, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of "greenhouse gases" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) pre-construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet "best available control technology" standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case by case basis.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These EPA rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S4	More recently, in June 2016, the EPA published final rules establishing new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions in the oil and natural gas source category by up to 45% from 2012 levels by the year 2025.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S5	The EPA s final rules include New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to limit methane emissions from equipment and processes across the oil and natural gas source category.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S6	The rules also extend limitations on volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions to sources that were unregulated under the previous NSPS at Subpart OOOO.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S7	Affected methane and VOC sources include hydraulically fractured (or re-fractured) oil and natural gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and pneumatic pumps.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S8	The new methane and VOC standards require the implementation of the best system of emission reduction to achieve these emission reductions, mirroring the existing VOC standards under Subpart OOOO.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S9	These rules could require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control methane and VOC emissions from our operations as well as the hiring of additional personnel to perform equipment inspections.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P62_S10	These requirements could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact or delay production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	venting and flaring and would require enhanced leak detection and repair programs.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Increased regulation of methane and other GHGs have the potential to result in increased compliance costs and, consequently, adversely affect our operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	There has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional cap and trade programs have emerged, which typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Severe limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which in turn could affect our profitability and stock price.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds and other institutions.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P65_S4	We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative contracts and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P65_S5	In addition, if any lender under our credit facility or our money market lines of credit is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility or our money market lines of credit.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, and swaps market participants, such as Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain swaps to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, unless an exception from mandatory clearing is available, and if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	To date, the CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	The CFTC has not yet required the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including commodity swaps.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the clearing requirement for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, along with changes to the markets for swaps as a result of the trade execution requirement, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S5	If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S6	In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S7	Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S8	If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in our revenues and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S9	Therefore, we are unable to determine the future costs on our derivative activities at this time.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P67_S10	Higher costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Act can create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risks, including market price fluctuations associated with anticipated production of oil and gas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, including by becoming more volatile and less predictable, which also could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity, revenues, cash flows and financial condition.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	In December 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules to amend the CEA to establish position limits for certain commodity futures and options contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, including those derivative instruments that we use.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If the CFTC position limit regulations are ultimately adopted substantially in the form proposed, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Until the CFTC adopts final rules with respect to position limits and any exemptions for bona fide derivative transactions or off-setting positions from those limits, we will be unable to determine whether the CFTC s proposed rules could result in additional derivative costs or adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	To the extent Newfield transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P70_S3	A substantial majority of our producing properties are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	A substantial majority of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	At December 31, 2016, 64% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in these areas.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on the leases or units containing the leasehold acreage .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P71_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 71% of our total net acreage was held by production.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Leases on oil and gas properties normally have a term of three to five years and will expire unless, prior to expiration of the lease term, production in paying quantities is established.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If the leases expire and we are unable to renew them, we will lose the right to develop the related properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The risk of the foregoing increases in periods of sustained low commodity prices due to the corresponding impact on our drilling plans and the likely decrease in what is considered economic production under the leases.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including commodity prices, drilling results, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We have risks associated with our China operations .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Ownership of property interests and production operations in China are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our China operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Our China operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation, investment and transparency issues.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our China operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Competition for, or the loss of, our senior management or experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel and the loss of any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a seasoned management team and experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P80_S4	In the past, competition for these professionals was strong, and in a continuing price recovery environment may become strong again, which could result in future retention and attraction issues.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our competitors include multinational oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	In addition, high commodity prices, asset valuations and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	As a consequence, our competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified field personnel could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment as demand for that equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	These factors have caused significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Higher oil, natural gas, and NGL prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Similarly, lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices generally result in a decline in service costs due to reduced demand for drilling and completion services.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some oilfield equipment, services and supplies.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S6	However, if the current oil and gas market changes, and commodity prices continue to recover, we may face shortages of field personnel, drilling rigs, or other equipment or supplies, which could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or restrict operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S7	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S8	Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S9	Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S10	We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S11	Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S12	Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S13	Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S14	We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S15	We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability and other coverages.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S16	Consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution and other environmental issues, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S17	For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).
912750_17_ITEM1A_P85_S18	In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and divestitures .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	As part of our business strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make acquisitions of oil and gas properties and to divest non-strategic assets.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	acquisition properties or suitable buyers of our non-strategic assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or not at all.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	These risks include that the acquired properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flows at anticipated levels.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Also, the integration of properties we acquire could be difficult.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P89_S4	In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P89_S5	The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
912750_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	These assessments are complex and the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P90_S3	In addition, our divestitures may pose significant residual risks to the Company, such as divestitures where we retain certain liabilities or we have legal successor liability due to the bankruptcy or dissolution of the purchaser.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Generally, uneconomic or unsuccessful acquisitions and divestitures may divert management s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P90_S5	We depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S3	We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S5	It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S6	We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any cyber incidents or interruptions to our arrangements with third parties, to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse or destruction of proprietary or other information, or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P91_S7	As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow due to the impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow of our customers.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of us .
912750_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	propose and nominate directors or otherwise propose actions for approval at stockholder meetings, as well as the ability of our board of directors to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In addition, our change of control severance plan, change of control severance agreements with certain officers and our omnibus stock plans and deferred compensation plan contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of equity awards and acceleration of deferred compensation, upon a change of control.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, or could reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of us.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Delays in obtaining licenses, permits, and other government authorizations required to conduct our operations could adversely affect our business.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Our operations require licenses, permits, and in some cases renewals of licenses and permits from various governmental authorities.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Our ability to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to changes in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable government agencies, among other factors.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Our inability to obtain, or our loss of or denial of extension, to any of these licenses or permits could hamper our ability to produce income, revenues or cash flows from our operations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the interest under the property.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	As we continue to expand our operations in Oklahoma, North Dakota or Utah, we may operate within the boundaries of Native American reservations and become subject to certain tribal laws and regulations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P96_S1	An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations applies to operators and other parties within the boundaries of Native American reservations in the United States.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the EPA, together with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American reservations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P96_S3	These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, tribal employment contractor preferences and numerous other matters.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and BLM.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	However, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation and has the right to enact and enforce certain other laws and regulations entirely independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations, as long as they do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P97_S2	These tribal laws and regulations include various fees, taxes, requirements to employ Native American tribal members or use tribal owned service businesses and numerous other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations within the boundaries of a Native American reservation.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation are often subject to the Native American tribal court system, unless there is a specific waiver of sovereign immunity by the Native American tribe allowing resolution of disputes between the Native American tribe and those lessees or operators to occur in federal or state court.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We therefore may become subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations.
912750_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	One or more of these Native American requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits necessary to operate on tribal lands pursuant to these regulations, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project on those lands.
912750_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	In August 2016, the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) announced its intent to resolve alleged systemic violations of the North Dakota air pollution control laws, N.D.C.C. ch.
912750_17_ITEM3_P1_S1	33-15, the North Dakota State Implementation Plan, and those provisions of the federal Clean Air Act and its body of implementing regulations for which the NDDH has been delegated authority by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), at the Company's facilities in North Dakota.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	The enforcement and settlement process results from EPA and North Dakota inspections of oil and gas facilities in North Dakota that revealed certain incidents of non-compliance at some facilities of the Company.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Companies that voluntarily choose to enter into the Consent Decree do not admit any violations but choose to do so in order to avoid potentially harsher enforcement through subsequent inspections of operated facilities in North Dakota.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Company entered into a Consent Decree in February 2017 that includes a payment of civil penalties and compliance with the terms and conditions therein.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	The penalties to be paid are also subject to possible reductions for early compliance with certain conditions therein for at least two years.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S4	In addition to the stipulated penalty there will be additional conditions added to facility permits requiring the Company to review and analyze its facility designs, and implement inspection and maintenance programs, among other conditions contained therein.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S5	The Consent Decree is filed with the North Dakota District Court in Burleigh County and will be reduced to a court order subject to termination upon consent from the Department of Health that all terms of the Consent Decree have been completed to the Department s satisfaction or after two years, or a company may petition the court for termination.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S6	We do not anticipate that these penalties will exceed $1 million.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S7	In addition, from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate related to alleged violations of environmental statutes or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S8	We cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines or penalties, or if such fines or penalties are imposed, that they would individually or in the aggregate exceed $100,000.
912750_17_ITEM3_P2_S9	If any federal government fines or penalties are in fact imposed that are greater than $100,000, then we will disclose such fact in our subsequent filings.

912750_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

912750_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our principal areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Uinta Basin of Utah.
912750_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	In addition, we have oil producing assets offshore China.
912750_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace produced reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on our ability to find, acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and affect the:
912750_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	amount of cash flows available for capital investments; ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We achieved many operational, financial and strategic successes in 2016 , including:
912750_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering for net proceeds of approximately $776 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	A portion of the proceeds was used to acquire additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play and to repay borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	increased liquidity to $2.4 billion consisting of a $1.8 billion undrawn credit facility and $580 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand at year end.
912750_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our 2017 business plan is focused on:
912750_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	implement a plan to further reduce domestic per unit lease operating costs.
912750_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our continuing operations consist of exploration, development and production activities in the United States and China.
912750_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	In January 2017, we signed an agreement, subject to customary regulatory approval, to sell our non-operated interest in the Bohai Bay field in China.
912750_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	See Note 21 , " Subsequent Events ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Revenues from domestic operations of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 3% lower than 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The lower revenues were attributable to a 9% decrease in the average crude oil and natural gas realized prices compared to 2015, partially offset by a 4% increase in average NGL realized prices.
912750_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	Increased production reduced the impact of lower commodity prices by $58 million.
912750_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our domestic year over year production increase of 8% was attributable to the Anadarko Basin.
912750_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our Anadarko Basin oil, natural gas and NGL production increased by 43%, 36% and 36%, respectively, during 2016.
912750_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Production in our other domestic basins declined or remained flat as compared to 2015 due to reduced drilling and natural decline in those areas.
912750_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	After adjusting for our STACK properties acquisition in the second quarter of 2016 and our Texas assets sale in the third quarter of 2016 (as discussed in Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties ," to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report), domestic liquids and natural gas production increased 9% and 16%, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenues from domestic operations of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 42% lower than 2014 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The lower revenues were attributable to a 46% decrease in the average revenue per BOE compared to 2014 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Domestic liquids production increased 12% year over year, reducing the impact of lower commodity prices by $236 million.
912750_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our 2015 domestic crude oil production increased 15%, primarily due to doubling our Anadarko Basin oil volumes from 2014 levels.
912750_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Additionally, Williston Basin and Eagle Ford each experienced year over year oil production increases of 3%.
912750_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Domestic NGL production increased 4%, while natural gas production decreased 2% from 2014 levels.
912750_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Adjusted for the sale of Granite Wash assets in the third quarter of 2014 (as discussed in Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties ," to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report), NGL and natural gas production increased 16% and 8%, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	NGL production volumes increased in the Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin by 20% and 40%, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	Natural gas production in the Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin increased 42% and 20%, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our revenues from China of $217 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , were 17% lower than 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The lower revenues were attributed to a 17% decrease in the 2016 realized crude oil price compared to 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Approximately 90% of our 2016 production from China was from the Pearl development.
912750_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Pearl development reached peak production during 2015 and was on plateau for most of 2016.
912750_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	We expect declining production from the Pearl development during 2017 and expect to close on the sale of our Bohai Bay assets in mid-2017.
912750_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	See Note 21 , " Subsequent Events ," to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our revenues from China were $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Approximately 85% of our 2015 production from China was from the Pearl development, which achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2014.
912750_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	The following table reflects our production/liftings from continuing operations and average realized commodity prices:
912750_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	_________________ (2) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	(3) Had we included the realized effects of derivative contracts, the domestic average realized prices would have been as follows:
912750_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The following table presents information about operating expenses for our continuing operations:
912750_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, total operating expenses per BOE decreased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The primary reasons for the decrease follow:
912750_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Total lease operating expenses (LOE) decreased 18% despite an 8% increase in total production due to our focus on cost-reduction initiatives in all basins.
912750_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	On a per BOE basis, lease operating expense was 24% lower due to successful cost reduction efforts combined with our focused growth in the Anadarko Basin, which has lower operating costs than our other basins.
912750_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Transportation and processing expense per BOE increased 19% primarily due to an increase in NGL and natural gas volumes produced of 25% and 12%, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	in the Uinta Basin (see further discussion below in " Contractual Obligations ") and higher utilization of pipelines to transport oil in the STACK play and Williston Basin, which allows us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a higher net price.
912750_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Production and other taxes decreased 15% per BOE year over year primarily due to our current development activities occurring in areas with lower production tax rates.
912750_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) decreased 44% per BOE primarily due to the impact of ceiling test impairments of $4.8 billion recorded in 2015 and $962 million recorded in the first half of 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	General and administrative expense (G A) decreased 13% .
912750_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	G A expenses for both years included capitalized direct internal costs and costs associated with workforce reductions and organizational restructuring.
912750_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Excluding these items that affect comparability, gross G A costs decreased 11% year over year, primarily due to cost savings initiatives including a more than 15% reduction of our workforce.
912750_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	The following table presents information regarding G A expenses for our domestic operations:
912750_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	_________________ (1) Includes severance costs for workforce reductions, as well as office-lease abandonment and other organizational restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Denver, Houston and Tulsa offices into our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas.
912750_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	(2) SVAP program decrease is associated with the decrease in the estimated fair value of the liability for our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP), which ended December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	During 2016 , we recorded ceiling test impairments of $962 million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The decrease primarily resulted from a 15% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 4% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since December 31, 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of current service cost reductions on our cash flow estimates.
912750_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Other operating expense increased $11 million primarily due to the settlement of a lawsuit against the Company during the third quarter of 2016.
912750_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	See Note 12 , "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:
912750_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Lease operating expense remained flat year over year.
912750_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	DD A expense per BOE decreased 30% primarily due to a reduction of our DD A rate as a result of the ceiling test impairments during the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016.
912750_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	During 2016, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments of $66 million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease primarily resulted from a 15% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing since December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses for our continuing operations:
912750_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses per BOE increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
912750_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The primary reasons for the increase follow:
912750_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Lease operating expenses decreased 27% on a per BOE basis primarily due to lower service costs and higher production volumes.
912750_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Service costs declined primarily in the Uinta and Anadarko basins period over period due to our increased focus on cost-reduction initiatives combined with downward service cost pressures in the industry due to lower oil and natural gas prices.
912750_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Transportation and processing expense increased 15% on a per BOE basis primarily due to the increase in combined gas and NGL volumes in SCOOP and STACK, which are subject to higher processing fees related to liquids-rich gas production.
912750_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Production and other taxes on a per BOE basis decreased 60% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, and a higher percent of our 2015 production derived from areas with lower production tax rates.
912750_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Additional decreases were due to enhanced recovery credits and tax incentives for stripper wells for our Uinta Basin assets, which includes $7 million of credits from prior years.
912750_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	Excluding the impact of these additional tax incentive recoveries, production and other taxes as a percent of total revenue were 4.0% and 4.7% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased 17% on a per BOE basis primarily due to the impact of $4.8 billion ceiling test impairments recorded in 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	General and administrative expense increased 7% primarily as a result of reduced capitalization of direct internal costs, workforce reductions, organization restructuring and stock-based compensation programs.
912750_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Excluding these items that affect comparability, gross G A costs decreased 15% year over year primarily due to cost savings initiatives including a more than 20% reduction of our workforce.
912750_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	The following table presents information regarding G A expenses for our domestic operations:
912750_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	_________________ (1) Capitalized direct internal costs decrease is consistent with the reduced exploration and development activities in the Uinta, Williston and Maverick basins during 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	(2) Includes severance costs for workforce reductions in early 2015 , as well as office-lease abandonment and other organizational restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Denver and Houston offices in 2015 into our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas.
912750_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	(3) SVAP program decrease is associated with the decrease in the estimated fair value of the liability for our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP), which ended December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	During 2014 , three thresholds were achieved that resulted in payments to employees.
912750_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	During 2015 , we recorded ceiling test impairments of $4.8 billion due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The decrease primarily resulted from a 47% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 40% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since December 31, 2014 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of service cost reductions on our cash flow estimates.
912750_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Additionally, during the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a $4 million rig impairment associated with our decision to indefinitely lay down both of our company-owned drilling rigs in the Uinta Basin.
912750_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other operating expense decreased $16 million primarily due to equipment inventory impairments and legal settlements recorded in 2014 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses increased $312 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a full year of production activity from our Pearl development and the ceiling test impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	As a result of the different cost structures of our Pearl development and our Bohai Bay field, the 2015 results are not comparable with 2014.
912750_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	a $5 million decrease in production and other taxes as a new regulation was implemented by the Chinese government in early 2015 resulting in no special levy taxes on production with an actual realized contract price below $65 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Pearl development produced at a rate of 13,000 BOPD (net) from five horizontal wells and one vertical well during the fourth quarter of 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years ended December 31.
912750_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Interest expense associated with unproved oil and gas properties is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Gross interest expense decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the April 2015 retirement of our $700 million aggregate principal of 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 using the proceeds from the lower interest rate $700 million 5 % Senior Notes due 2026 issued in March 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Gross interest expense decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to the fourth quarter of 2014 retirement of our 7 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 and the April 2015 retirement of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020.
912750_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	This decrease was partially offset by the additional interest expense associated with the March 2015 issuance of our $700 million 5 % Senior Notes due 2026.
912750_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	See Note 11 , " Debt ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Capitalized interest increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average amount of unproved oil and gas properties related to unproved properties acquired during the year.
912750_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Capitalized interest decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to a reduction of the average amount of unproved oil and gas properties coupled with a reduced capitalization rate due to a reduction in our average borrowing rate.
912750_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The fluctuations in commodity derivative income (expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding derivative contracts during these periods.
912750_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The amount of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives is the result of the change in the total fair value of our derivative positions from the prior year.
912750_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The $191 million loss recognized in "Commodity derivative income (expense)" in our 2016 consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments is comprised of a $201 million realized gain and a $392 million unrealized loss.
912750_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follow:
912750_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The $259 million gain recognized in "Commodity derivative income (expense)" in our 2015 consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments is comprised of a $505 million realized gain and a $246 million unrealized loss.
912750_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follow:
912750_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the change in valuation allowances, non-deductible expenses, state income taxes, the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates and the impact of taxation of our China earnings in both the U.S and China.
912750_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our future effective tax rates may also be impacted by additional ceiling test impairments or other items which generate deferred tax assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and/or reversal of such valuation allowances.
912750_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were (2)% and 32% , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The following table summarizes our tax activity that derives our 2016 effective tax rate.
912750_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes " to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional disclosures.
912750_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	During the second quarter of 2013, our business in Malaysia met the criteria for classification as held for sale and was reported as discontinued operations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	In February 2014, Newfield International Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the sale of our Malaysia business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad, a Malaysian public company, for $898 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," and Note 20 , " Discontinued Operations ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the sale of our Malaysia business.
912750_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our 2014 Malaysia revenues were primarily from the sale of crude oil.
912750_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore Malaysia operations was produced into FPSOs and sold periodically as barge quantities were accumulated.
912750_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Our production from discontinued operations in 2014 was 822,000 barrels of crude oil (represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced) with an average realized price of $109.86 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	Revenues were recorded when oil was lifted and sold, not when it was produced into FPSOs or onshore storage terminals.
912750_17_ITEM7_P61_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from discontinued operations were $90 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table presents our total operating expenses for discontinued operations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, as well as cash on hand and the available borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Given the uncertainty regarding crude oil prices, our capital spending for 2016 (excluding acquisitions) was reduced from 2015 levels to reduce deficit spending and preserve long-term liquidity.
912750_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	During 2016 , as part of our strategy to optimize long-term liquidity, we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering for net proceeds of approximately $776 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	A portion of the proceeds was used to acquire additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play and to repay borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	The remainder is available for general corporate purposes.
912750_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	In addition, during 2016 we divested substantially all our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately $380 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P65_S4	As a result of the foregoing, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of liquidity consisting of a $1.8 billion undrawn credit facility and $580 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand.
912750_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	We expect our 2017 budget will be financed through our cash flows from operations and cash on hand.
912750_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	However, given the volatility and uncertainty of commodity prices, we may borrow under our credit facility, sell non-strategic assets or access the public debt and equity markets.
912750_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	Our 2017 capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and direct internal costs of approximately $120 million , is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion, which reflects our current outlook for commodity prices in 2017.
912750_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results; oil, natural gas and NGL prices; industry conditions; the prices and availability of goods and services; and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold.
912750_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions is unpredictable.
912750_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances or fluctuations in our cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	We continuously monitor our liquidity needs, coordinate our capital expenditure program with our expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluate our available alternative sources of liquidity, including accessing debt and equity capital markets in light of current and expected economic conditions.
912750_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	We believe that our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our operations will be adequate to fund 2017 operations and continue to meet our other obligations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
912750_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
912750_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	The amounts involved may be material.
912750_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Credit Arrangements and Other Financing Activities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	In March 2016, we entered into the fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement.
912750_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	This amendment changed certain definitions related to our financial covenants and decreased our interest coverage ratio from 3.0:1.0 to 2.5:1.0.
912750_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	Our borrowing capacity remains at $1.8 billion and the facility maturity date remains June 2020.
912750_17_ITEM7_P70_S4	We incurred approximately $3 million of financing costs related to this amendment, which were included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P70_S5	We also maintain money market lines of credit of $125 million reduced from $195 million at December 31, 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	At December 31, 2016 , we had no borrowings under our money market lines of credit, no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	We have no scheduled maturities of senior notes until 2022.
912750_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior notes, see Note 11 , " Debt ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and certain noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, ceiling test impairments and goodwill impairments) to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0.
912750_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	At December 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under our credit facility and do not foresee this changing in 2017 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	As of February 16, 2017 , we had no borrowings under our money market lines of credit and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
912750_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners.
912750_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital.
912750_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	At December 31, 2016 , we had positive working capital of $265 million , primarily due to cash on hand from the sale of our Texas assets, as compared to negative working capital of $22 million at December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our primary source of capital and liquidity is cash flows provided by operations, which are primarily affected by the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as commodity prices, net of the effects of derivative contract settlements and changes in working capital.
912750_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our net cash flows provided by operations were approximately $826 million in 2016 , $1.2 billion in 2015 and $1.4 billion in 2014 (includes $3 million of cash flows provided by our Malaysia discontinued operations).
912750_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	We had no cash flows provided by discontinued operations in 2016 or 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	The primary drivers of lower operating cash flows in 2016 were lower realized derivative gains, which we expect to continue in 2017 , as well as lower revenues as a result of lower commodity prices.
912750_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $991 million , $1.6 billion and $660 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	divested substantially all our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately $380 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	For a more detailed description of the Anadarko Basin acquisition and Texas asset divestiture, see Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	During 2015 , we reduced capital spending on oil and gas properties by $457 million as compared to 2014 due to the economic environment for our industry.
912750_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	During 2014 , capital spending on oil and gas properties was $2.1 billion, and we received net proceeds of $1.4 billion from the sale of our Malaysia business and Granite Wash assets.
912750_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities was $715 million and $380 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Net cash used in financing activities was $808 million in 2014 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	During 2016 , we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering for net proceeds of approximately $776 million .
912750_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	issued 25.3 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately $815 million , which were used primarily to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit; and During 2014 , we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 using the proceeds from the sale of our Granite Wash assets.
912750_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In April 2015 and May 2016, we announced plans to restructure our organization primarily in response to the current commodity price environment and to improve margins, processes and cost efficiencies in operations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations due by year as of December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes assets and liabilities associated with our derivative contracts, which are dependent on the commodity price at the time of the contract settlement.
912750_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	For a discussion regarding our derivative contracts, see Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	(2) Includes agreements for office space, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The majority of these obligations relate to contracts for office space and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	We have crude oil minimum volume delivery commitments that relate to our Uinta Basin production with two Salt Lake City, Utah refiners.
912750_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	One delivery commitment is for approximately 15,000 barrels of oil per day through May 2020.
912750_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	The second commitment is for 20,000 barrels of oil per day through August 2025.
912750_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we incur deficiency fees ranging from $3.50 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	During 2016, we incurred $16 million of Uinta Basin deficiency fees.
912750_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	Based on forecasted production levels for 2017 , we expect to incur $30 million to $40 million in deficiency fees related to these delivery commitments in 2017.
912750_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	These obligations are typically shared on a "working interest" basis.
912750_17_ITEM7_P88_S4	The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P88_S5	Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We use derivative contracts to manage the variability in cash flows caused by commodity price fluctuations associated with our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 24 to 36 months .
912750_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our NGL production.
912750_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see " Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities " below and " Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices " in Item 7A of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	See the discussion and tables in Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," and Note 5 , " Fair Value Measurements ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Between January 1, 2017 and February 16, 2017 , we did not enter into additional derivative contracts.
912750_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full description of the critical accounting policies and estimates below, as well as other accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S4	Below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S5	We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.
912750_17_ITEM7_P95_S6	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Two generally accepted accounting methods are available for accounting for oil and gas producing activities successful efforts and full cost.
912750_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while these costs are capitalized under the full cost method.
912750_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	Both methods provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two-step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to assess for impairment.
912750_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	If required, the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward-looking prices.
912750_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	Impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the after-tax carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the after-tax net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using SEC pricing, costs in effect at year end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Proved Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	Our engineering estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including DD A expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	Proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are the estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on SEC pricing and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S4	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S5	Changes in commodity prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir will result in future revisions to our estimated proved reserves quantities.
912750_17_ITEM7_P100_S6	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	Under the full cost method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into country-based cost centers .
912750_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied as a reduction of the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	Future development and abandonment costs are added, and unevaluated costs are withheld from the net costs capitalized in cost centers to represent a full cost pool, which is amortized and assessed for impairment.
912750_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Future development costs include expected costs to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our gathering systems, production platforms and related structures, and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	We estimate these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and information from our engineering consultants.
912750_17_ITEM7_P102_S3	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimation is difficult and requires judgments that are subject to revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs annually, or more frequently if circumstances change.
912750_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability and corresponding long-lived asset for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred.
912750_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	The liability is increased to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	To change our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2016 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.15 per BOE, which would require a change in estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 4%, or $77 million.
912750_17_ITEM7_P105_S3	Our China DD A rate would need to change by $1.40 per BOE, which would require a change in estimate of our China future development and abandonment costs of approximately 129%, or $9 million.
912750_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our full cost pool and from amortization until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our full cost pool with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	Leasehold costs are transferred to our full cost pool to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	Currently, there are no unevaluated properties for our China business.
912750_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into our full cost pool involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage.
912750_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	At December 31, 2016 , we had a total of $1,238 million of costs excluded from the respective full cost pools, all of which related to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	Inclusion of these costs in our domestic full cost pool, without adding any associated reserves, could have resulted in additional ceiling test impairments.
912750_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	The full cost pool for each country is amortized using a unit-of-production method based on the cost center's proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.
912750_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	Estimated proved reserves are a significant component of the calculation of DD A expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_17_ITEM7_P109_S2	Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_17_ITEM7_P109_S3	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test impairment.
912750_17_ITEM7_P109_S4	To change our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2016 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.15 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 2%, or 11 MMBOE.
912750_17_ITEM7_P109_S5	Our China DD A rate would need to change by $1.40 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our China proved reserves of approximately 10%, or 1 MMBOE.
912750_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of oil and gas property costs that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	The ceiling value of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is calculated based on SEC pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	Once recorded, a ceiling test impairment is not reversible even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	We do not anticipate a ceiling test impairment in either the U.S. or China in the first quarter of 2017 , as the current strip prices as of February 16, 2017 are above the current SEC pricing for oil and natural gas.
912750_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating and development costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve additions and tax attributes.
912750_17_ITEM7_P112_S2	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, it is possible that we could experience additional ceiling test impairments in the future.
912750_17_ITEM7_P112_S3	See Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties Ceiling Test Impairments ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
912750_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties.
912750_17_ITEM7_P114_S2	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and judgments, the accuracy of this allocation is inherently uncertain and could lead to materially different amounts allocated between proved and unproved oil and gas properties which would result in differences in recognizing depletion and amortization in future periods.
912750_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	However, we do not designate any of our derivative contracts as accounting hedges.
912750_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_17_ITEM7_P115_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , we had a net derivative liability of $25 million , of which 59%, based on total contracted volumes, was measured based upon a modified Black-Scholes valuation model and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
912750_17_ITEM7_P115_S4	The value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different from the fair value as of December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	For further discussion of our derivative instruments and activities, see " Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices ," in Item 7A of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7_P116_S2	Also see Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," and Note 5 , " Fair Value Measurements ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for equity and liability awards.
912750_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance- and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_17_ITEM7_P117_S3	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.
912750_17_ITEM7_P117_S4	See Note 15 , " Stock-Based Compensation ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires significant judgment by management and is reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances.
912750_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the related deferred tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	Changes in judgment regarding future realizability of deferred tax assets may result in the reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.
912750_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	In the period that determination is made, our net income will benefit from a lower effective tax rate.
912750_17_ITEM7_P122_S3	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of income taxes.
912750_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of new accounting requirements.
912750_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	Exploration, development, production and the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_17_ITEM7_P124_S2	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_17_ITEM7_P124_S3	See the discussion under the caption " We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business ," in Item 1A of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to enter into derivative contracts is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While the use of derivative contracts can limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In addition, the use of derivative contracts may involve basis risk.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	At December 31, 2016 , 10 of our 16 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our contracted volumes with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 14% .
912750_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , 12,753 MBbls of our expected 2017 crude oil production were protected against price volatility using collars and swaps, over 51% which have associated sold puts.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average price of our sold puts of $73.83 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	If the market price remains below $73.83 per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $15.06 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P4_S3	For 6,548 MBbls of our 2017 volumes, we have locked in an average minimum premium of $13.54 over the market price using purchased calls.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P4_S4	The weighted average strike price of the purchased calls approximates the weighted average strike price of the sold puts, thereby effectively locking in the value.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P4_S5	For further discussion of our derivative instruments and activities, see Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2016 , our debt included:
912750_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because 100% of our obligations were at fixed rates as of December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A 10% increase in LIBOR would not impact our interest costs on debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 , but would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	To the extent that business transactions in a foreign country are not denominated in the U.S. dollar, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_17_ITEM7A_P7_S3	We did not have any open derivative contracts related to foreign currencies at December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), the management of our Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newfield Exploration Company:
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S2	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_17_ITEM8_P6_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_17_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).
912750_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our U.S. operations are onshore and focus primarily on large scale, liquids-rich resource plays.
912750_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	Our principal areas of operation are the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Uinta Basin of Utah.
912750_17_ITEM8_P14_S3	In addition, we have oil producing assets offshore China.
912750_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to "Newfield," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	Other risks and uncertainties that could affect us in the current commodity price environment include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, responsibility for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own, inability to access credit markets, regulatory risks and our ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing impairment of our oil and gas properties.
912750_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
912750_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	Our most significant estimates are associated with the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the timing and amount of transfers of our unevaluated properties into our amortizable full cost pool, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the fair value of our derivative contracts.
912750_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Restructuring costs include severance and related benefit costs, costs associated with abandoned office space, employee relocation costs and other associated costs.
912750_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Employee severance and related benefit costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period, if any.
912750_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Employee relocation costs are expensed as incurred.
912750_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	On the date a leased property ceases to be used, a liability for non-cancellable office-lease costs associated with restructuring is recognized and measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Fair value estimates include assumptions regarding estimated future sublease payments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	These estimates could materially differ from actual results and may require revision to initial estimates of the liability.
912750_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," for additional disclosures.
912750_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years reported amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.
912750_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	These reclassifications did not impact our net income (loss), stockholders equity or cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	See Note 20 , " Discontinued Operations ," for additional disclosures, as well as information regarding the sale of our Malaysia business, which closed in February 2014.
912750_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	These financial statements and notes are inclusive of our Malaysia operations through the closing date unless otherwise noted.
912750_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Substantially all of our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold at market-based prices to a variety of purchasers, primarily under short-term contracts (less than 12 months).
912750_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	We also have long-term contracts in the Uinta Basin at market-based prices, less a variable differential that becomes fixed below certain market price thresholds.
912750_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_17_ITEM8_P25_S3	Revenues from the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Under the sales method, the Company and other joint owners may sell more or less than their entitled share of production.
912750_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	Should the Company s excess sales exceed our share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves, a liability is recorded.
912750_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Differences between sales and our entitled share of production are not material.
912750_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Gains and losses incurred on transactions in a currency other than the U.S. dollar are recorded under the caption "Other income (expense) Other, net" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Restricted cash consists of amounts held in escrow accounts to satisfy future plug and abandonment obligations for our China operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released as we plug and abandon wells and facilities in China.
912750_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	Consistent with our other plug and abandonment activities, changes in restricted cash are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Our short-term investment at December 31, 2016 was a $25 million certificate of deposit, which is classified as "held-to-maturity" and stated at cost.
912750_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Accordingly, no unrealized gains and losses are recognized.
912750_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Long-term investments consist of debt and equity securities, a majority of which are classified as "available-for-sale" and stated at fair value.
912750_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.
912750_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	At December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity related to investments was $1 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	We routinely assess material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_17_ITEM8_P34_S2	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of related joint interest billings.
912750_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected.
912750_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our China operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market.
912750_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in China is produced into floating storage facilities and sold periodically as barge quantities accumulate.
912750_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	The carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of related production costs and depletion expense.
912750_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	See Note 3 , " Inventories ," for further discussion.
912750_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into country-based cost centers.
912750_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, we sold our Malaysia business, which constituted the entire full cost pool for Malaysia.
912750_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	See Note 20 , " Discontinued Operations ," for further discussion.
912750_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	A particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test impairment to the extent of such excess.
912750_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	If required, a ceiling test impairment reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The risk that we will be required to impair the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas and NGL prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period, or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our full cost pool until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage, related seismic data and capitalized interest and direct internal costs are initially excluded from our full cost pool.
912750_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our full cost pool with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	Leasehold costs are transferred to our full cost pool to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	See Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties ," for a detailed discussion regarding our oil and gas property and our asset acquisitions and sales transactions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Gathering systems and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 25 years.
912750_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the ARO is incurred.
912750_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	Settlements include payments made to satisfy the AROs, as well as transfer of the AROs to purchasers of our divested properties.
912750_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	In general, the amount of the initial recorded ARO and the costs capitalized will equal the estimated future costs to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using the credit adjusted risk-free rate for our Company.
912750_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value and the original capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	Both the accretion and depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	See Note 10 , " Asset Retirement Obligations ," for further discussion.
912750_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, liabilities and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
912750_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	We accrue for losses when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
912750_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	See Note 12 , " Commitments and Contingencies ," for a more detailed discussion regarding our contingencies.
912750_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed as incurred.
912750_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based upon evaluations of currently available facts related to each site.
912750_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	We also evaluate potential uncertain tax positions, and if necessary, establish accruals for such items.
912750_17_ITEM8_P53_S3	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes ," for further discussion.
912750_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for equity and liability awards.
912750_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance- and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_17_ITEM8_P54_S3	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.
912750_17_ITEM8_P54_S4	See Note 15 , " Stock-Based Compensation ," for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other joint interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	In addition, when warranted, we require prepayments from our joint interest owners for drilling and completion projects.
912750_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	Our joint interest owners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers whose ability to reimburse us could be negatively impacted by adverse market conditions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	The purchasers of our oil, gas and NGL production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	All of our derivative transactions were carried out in the over-the-counter market and are not typically subject to margin-deposit requirements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	We monitor the credit ratings of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis.
912750_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	Although we have entered into derivative contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price volatility.
912750_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd. accounted for 12% of our total revenues in 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	During 2015 , China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd., MidCon Gathering LLC and Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC accounted for 13% , 11% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	During 2014 , Tesoro Corporation and Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC accounted for 12% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	We believe that the loss of a major customer would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are available.
912750_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Our derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.
912750_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	While we utilize our derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance.
912750_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities is reflected as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives are determined to have a significant financing element at inception, in which case they are classified within financing activities.
912750_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	See Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet accordingly.
912750_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	See Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," for details regarding the gross amounts, as well as the impact of our netting arrangements on our net derivative position.
912750_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance regarding the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explains the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents using a retrospective approach.
912750_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
912750_17_ITEM8_P63_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the simplification of employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
912750_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	We adopted this guidance in the second quarter of 2016 as permitted by the guidance.
912750_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	Adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial statements, except for the simplification in accounting for income taxes using a modified retrospective approach.
912750_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	Upon adoption, we recorded a related deferred tax asset for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits of $37 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	As we consider it more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $37 million , resulting in no net effect on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P64_S5	We elected to continue our current policy of estimating forfeitures.
912750_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for leases.
912750_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	The guidance requires recognition of most leases on the balance sheet.
912750_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	The guidance requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.
912750_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
912750_17_ITEM8_P65_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding several broad topics related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
912750_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
912750_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
912750_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	In April 2016, May 2016 and December 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance, addressed implementation issues and provided technical corrections.
912750_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	The guidance may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit).
912750_17_ITEM8_P67_S3	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
912750_17_ITEM8_P67_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Reserve for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes an allowance for $15 million related to discontinued operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	During 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we had inventory writedowns of $1 million , $5 million and $9 million , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	These writedowns are included in "Operating expenses Other" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the crude oil inventory from our China operations consisted of approximately 11,500 and 335,000 barrels of crude oil, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	We utilize derivative strategies that consist of either a single derivative instrument or a combination of instruments to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future domestic oil and natural gas production.
912750_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	While the use of derivative instruments may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	With respect to a swap position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price.
912750_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Collars (combination of purchased put options (floor) and sold call options (ceiling)) .
912750_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	For a collar position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor strike price while we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling strike price.
912750_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor strike price and equal to or less than the ceiling strike price.
912750_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	A swap with a sold put position consists of a standard swap position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the associated fixed-price swap.
912750_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	This structure enables us to increase the fixed-price swap with the value received through the sale of the put.
912750_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the put strike price, then we will only receive the difference between the swap price and the put strike price.
912750_17_ITEM8_P75_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard swap only.
912750_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	A collar with a sold put position consists of a standard collar position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the floor strike price of the collar.
912750_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	This structure enables us to improve the collar strike prices with the value received through the sale of the additional put.
912750_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the additional put strike price, then we will receive the difference between the floor strike price and the additional put strike price.
912750_17_ITEM8_P76_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar only.
912750_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	Purchased calls are options that require a counterparty to make a payment to us if the settlement price is above the call strike price (excluding the effects of the deferred premium owed by us to the counterparty).
912750_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	As a result, these positions lock in the value of a portion of our corresponding oil swaps with sold puts as well as collars with sold puts.
912750_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	A swaption is an option to exercise a swap where the buyer (counterparty) of the swaption purchases the right from the seller (Newfield), but not the obligation, to enter into a fixed-price swap with the seller on a predetermined date (expiration date).
912750_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	The swap price is a fixed price determined at the time of the swaption contract.
912750_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	If the swaption is exercised, the contract will become a swap treated consistent with our other fixed-price swaps.
912750_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX.
912750_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk adjustments using counterparty rates of default and time to maturity.
912750_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	The calculation of the fair value of options requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	At December 31, 2016 , we had outstanding derivative positions as set forth in the tables below.
912750_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	_________________ (1) For the volumes with sold puts, if the market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the market price plus the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	the difference between our swaps and our sold puts for fixed-price swaps with sold puts.
912750_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	We have effectively locked in the spreads noted above (less the deferred call premium) for all of the volumes with sold puts using purchased calls.
912750_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	(2) We deferred the premiums related to the purchased calls until contract settlement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	At December 31, 2016 , the deferred premiums totaled $10 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in "Commodity derivative income (expense)" in our consolidated statement of operations related to our derivative financial instruments follows:
912750_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from the separate derivative instruments with that counterparty.
912750_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	At December 31, 2016 , 10 of our 16 counterparties accounted for approximately 85% of our contracted volumes, with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 14% .
912750_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	At December 31, 2016 , approximately 84% of our volumes subject to derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility.
912750_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	Our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity fixed-price swaps.
912750_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	Level 3 instruments primarily include derivative instruments, such as commodity options (i.e., price collars, sold puts, purchased calls or swaptions).
912750_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	We use a modified Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for option and swaption derivative contracts that considers various inputs including: (a) forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	Our valuation model for the Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP) was a Monte Carlo simulation that was based on a probability model and considered various inputs including: (a) the measurement date stock price, (b) time value and (c) historical and implied volatility.
912750_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
912750_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The determination of the fair values of our derivative contracts incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved.
912750_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	We utilize counterparty rate of default values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to, and receivables from, counterparties.
912750_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
912750_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods.
912750_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	_________________ (1) During the second quarter of 2014, we transferred $3 million of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 category, resulting from the exercise of our Level 3 swaptions by the counterparties to swaps in May 2014.
912750_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	(2) During the second quarter of 2016, we transferred $46 million of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 category, resulting from the exercise of our Level 3 swaptions by the counterparties to swaps in June 2016.
912750_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	During the first quarter of 2014, all auction rate securities that we held as of January 1, 2014, were sold for $39 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	The estimated future prices are compared to the strike prices fixed by our derivative contracts, and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the contractual life are discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts and interest rates.
912750_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	(decreases) in the quoted forward prices for commodities generally lead to corresponding decreases (increases) in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	Significant changes in the volatility factors utilized in our option-pricing model can cause significant changes in the fair value measurement of our oil and gas derivative contracts.
912750_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	Historically, we have not experienced significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulting from changes in counterparty credit risk as the counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an "investment grade" credit rating.
912750_17_ITEM8_P103_S2	See Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," for additional discussion of our derivative instruments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	The calculation of the fair value of the SVAP liability required the use of a probability-based Monte Carlo simulation, which included unobservable inputs.
912750_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	The simulation predicted multiple scenarios of future stock returns over the performance period, which were discounted to calculate the fair value.
912750_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	The fair value was recognized over a service period derived from the simulation.
912750_17_ITEM8_P104_S3	The SVAP performance period and program ended December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as of December 31, was as follows:
912750_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	Any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	At December 31, oil and gas properties consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	Costs withheld from amortization as of December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	We capitalized approximately $121 million , $107 million and $199 million of interest and direct internal costs in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, we finalized a settlement agreement with our insurance carriers related to an August 2013 LF-7 topside incident in China and recorded a $57 million receivable (the Company's share) and associated reduction to capital expenditures.
912750_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	The settlement proceeds were collected in July 2015.
912750_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	Ceiling Test Impairments Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of oil and gas property costs that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	Ceiling test impairments during 2015 and 2016 consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	_________________ (1) Starting in the first quarter of 2016, there was no tax impact due to a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
912750_17_ITEM8_P112_S1	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes ," for additional information regarding the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
912750_17_ITEM8_P112_S2	(2) Excludes domestic rig impairment of $4 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	Using SEC pricing at December 31, 2016, the domestic and China cost center ceilings exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $873 million and $7 million , respectively, and as such, no ceiling test impairments were required.
912750_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	Future declines in SEC pricing or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could result in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods.
912750_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	Texas Asset Sale In September 2016, we closed on the sale of substantially all of our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately $380 million , subject to customary post-close adjustments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The sales of our Texas assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_17_ITEM8_P114_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Texas operations through the date of sale.
912750_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Anadarko Basin Acquisition In June 2016, we acquired additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for an adjusted cash purchase price of $476 million , subject to customary post-close adjustments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	We also assumed asset retirement obligations of $8 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	We allocated $398 million to unproved properties and wells in progress and $86 million to proved oil and gas properties.
912750_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	Granite Wash Asset Sale In September 2014, we closed on the sale of our Granite Wash assets, located primarily in Texas, for approximately $588 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	The sale of our Granite Wash assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Granite Wash operations through the date of sale.
912750_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	During 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $7 million , $125 million and $33 million , respectively, and sold certain other oil and gas properties for proceeds of approximately $39 million , $90 million and $69 million , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	The cash flows and results of operations for the assets included in a sale are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_17_ITEM8_P117_S2	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	At December 31, other property and equipment consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	For the years ended December 31, income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	For the years ended December 31, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes for continuing operations consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following table presents a reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate.
912750_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	The provision for state deferred income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was attributable to Oklahoma state deferred tax expense.
912750_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	Other state taxing jurisdictions were in a net deferred tax asset position for which a corresponding valuation allowance was recorded resulting in zero deferred tax benefit for those jurisdictions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P122_S2	The amount for state income taxes in the rate reconciliation table above is the net of deferred tax expenses and benefits before valuation allowances, if any, generated from all states.
912750_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	Our effective tax rate for 2016 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to domestic and international deferred tax asset valuation allowances discussed below.
912750_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	At December 31, the components of our deferred tax asset (liability) were as follows:
912750_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $849 million and $852 million for federal income tax, respectively and $1.8 billion for state income tax purposes, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_17_ITEM8_P125_S1	NOL carryforwards of $138 million are subject to annual limitations due to stock ownership changes.
912750_17_ITEM8_P125_S2	We currently estimate that we will not be able to utilize $173 million of our various gross state NOLs because we do not have sufficient estimated future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P125_S3	To the extent not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2036.
912750_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had foreign tax credits of approximately $593 million and $572 million , respectively, which will expire during the years 2022 through 2026.
912750_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing deferred tax assets.
912750_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	The change in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows at December 31:
912750_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	Due to the ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in 2015, we moved from a deferred tax liability position to a deferred tax asset position in most taxing jurisdictions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P130_S1	With the continuation of current commodity price levels, we consider it more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized and therefore, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets of $466 million and $202 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P130_S2	The net change in the domestic valuation allowance for 2016 of $466 million includes an increase of $37 million for the early adoption of the simplification of employee share-based payment transactions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P130_S3	We recorded a full valuation allowance on our China deferred tax assets of $29 million and $13 million , for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	As the result of the divestiture of the Malaysia operations in 2014, all of the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance were transferred to the buyer.
912750_17_ITEM8_P131_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we wrote off the other international deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances since we have ceased operating in these jurisdictions and it is remote that the NOL carryforwards will be realized in the future.
912750_17_ITEM8_P131_S2	In fourth quarter of 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we recorded valuation allowances related to insufficient estimated future domestic taxable income to fully utilize foreign tax credits before they expire of $21 million , $25 million and $12 million , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	The foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is fully offset by a valuation allowance.
912750_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did not accrue related interest or penalties.
912750_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	The tax years 2013 through 2015 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Unrealized derivative gains and losses are treated differently for income tax purposes in the various state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate fluctuates in periods with significant commodity price volatility.
912750_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	These effective tax rate fluctuations are magnified when income before taxes approaches zero.
912750_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	The change in our ARO for continuing operations for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:

912750_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	At December 31, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	In March 2016, we entered into the fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement.
912750_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	This amendment changed certain definitions related to our financial covenants and decreased our interest coverage ratio from 3.0 :1.0 to 2.5 :1.0.
912750_17_ITEM8_P139_S2	Our borrowing capacity remains at $1.8 billion and the facility maturity date remains June 2020.
912750_17_ITEM8_P139_S3	We incurred approximately $3 million of financing costs related to this amendment, which were included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 12% of total commitments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	During 2016, our debt rating was downgraded by rating agencies, and as a result, our borrowing costs under the credit facility increased by 25 basis points.
912750_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	institutions, was reduced from $195 million at December 31, 2015 to $125 million at December 31, 2016 .
912750_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	This borrowing capacity is subject to compliance with restrictive covenants in our credit facility.
912750_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating ( 100 basis points per annum at December 31, 2016 ) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating ( 200 basis points per annum at December 31, 2016 ).
912750_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating ( 37.5 basis points per annum at December 31, 2016 ).
912750_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately $7 million , $5 million and $4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which were recorded in Interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and the maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and noncash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and ceiling test impairments) to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0.
912750_17_ITEM8_P145_S1	At December 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility.
912750_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating ( 200 basis points at December 31, 2016 ).
912750_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made; a change of control; or certain other material adverse changes in our business.
912750_17_ITEM8_P147_S1	Our senior notes also contain standard events of default.
912750_17_ITEM8_P147_S2	If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_17_ITEM8_P147_S3	In addition, our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P147_S4	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Concentration of Credit Risk ," for additional details.
912750_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	In March 2015, we issued $700 million of 5 % Senior Notes due 2026 and received net proceeds of $691 million (net of offering costs of approximately $9 million ).
912750_17_ITEM8_P148_S1	These notes were issued at par to yield 5 %.
912750_17_ITEM8_P148_S2	In April 2015, we redeemed our $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020.
912750_17_ITEM8_P148_S3	In connection with the redemption, we paid a premium of $24 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P148_S4	Other, net" on our consolidated statement of income.
912750_17_ITEM8_P148_S5	In addition, associated unamortized offering costs and discounts of approximately $8 million were charged to interest expense during the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the redemption.
912750_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_17_ITEM8_P149_S1	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P149_S2	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_17_ITEM8_P149_S3	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P149_S4	The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	We have various commitments for firm transportation, operating lease agreements for office space and other agreements.
912750_17_ITEM8_P150_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , future minimum payments under these non-cancelable agreements are as follows:

912750_17_ITEM8_P151_S1	Rent expense with respect to our lease commitments for office space for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $21 million , $35 million and $20 million , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Our other agreements are primarily other equipment leases.
912750_17_ITEM8_P152_S1	Payments under our drilling-related contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	We have crude oil minimum volume delivery commitments that relate to our Uinta Basin production with two Salt Lake City, Utah refiners.
912750_17_ITEM8_P153_S1	One delivery commitment is for approximately 15,000 barrels of oil per day through May 2020.
912750_17_ITEM8_P153_S2	The second commitment is for 20,000 barrels of oil per day through August 2025.
912750_17_ITEM8_P153_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	Given the volatility in oil and natural gas prices and the related impact on our 2017 planned capital investments, as well as the potential impact on development plans in future years, we could fail to deliver the minimum production required under these commitments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $3.50 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM8_P154_S2	During 2016, we incurred $16 million of Uinta Basin deficiency fees.
912750_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	In May 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the Company alleging certain plugging and abandonment predecessor-in-interest liabilities related to offshore assets sold by the Company in 2010.
912750_17_ITEM8_P155_S1	The Company responded to the petition, denied the allegations and vigorously defended the case.
912750_17_ITEM8_P155_S2	The court held that the Company must bear a "portion" of the plugging and abandonment costs, but the "exact percentage" of such costs should be determined in arbitration and stayed the case pending arbitration.
912750_17_ITEM8_P155_S3	Through settlement negotiations surrounding the arbitration proceeding, the Company and the plaintiff reached a mutual settlement on September 23, 2016 involving a cash payment by the Company totaling $18 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	recorded under the caption "Operating expenses Other" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P156_S1	On October 3, 2016, the court dismissed the case with prejudice.
912750_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_17_ITEM8_P157_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	During the first quarter of 2016, we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering for net proceeds of approximately $776 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P158_S1	A portion of the proceeds was used to acquire additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play and to repay borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_17_ITEM8_P158_S2	The remainder is available for general corporate purposes.
912750_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, we issued 25.3 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering.
912750_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	We received net proceeds of approximately $815 million , which were used primarily to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit that were outstanding at that time.
912750_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	In May 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation that increased the total authorized shares of common stock from 200 million to 300 million shares.
912750_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	Upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we typically repurchase a portion of the vested shares for payment of employee tax withholding.
912750_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	Such repurchases are not part of a publicly announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock.
912750_17_ITEM8_P161_S2	During 2016 , Newfield repurchased 583,340 shares.
912750_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income less any applicable adjustments (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (excluding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	Diluted EPS incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation grants and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for the indicated years:
912750_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	For the years ended December 31, our stock-based compensation expense consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $61 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards that vest within four years .
912750_17_ITEM8_P166_S1	On December 31, 2016 , the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $40.50 per share.
912750_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	Equity awards consist of service-based and performance- or market-based restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
912750_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	Stock-based compensation classified as equity awards are currently granted under the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan, as amended (2011 Plan), to employees and non-employee directors.
912750_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our performance- and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_17_ITEM8_P169_S0	Compensation expense for equity awards is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable remaining vesting periods.
912750_17_ITEM8_P170_S0	Shares available for grant under our 2011 Plan are reduced by 1.87 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_17_ITEM8_P170_S1	In May 2015, our stockholders approved an additional 7.0 million shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan, resulting in approximately (1) 5.1 million shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan if all future awards are stock options, or (2) 2.7 million additional shares available for issuance under our 2011 Plan if all future awards are restricted stock awards or restricted stock units.
912750_17_ITEM8_P170_S2	Thus far, all awards under our 2011 Plan have been granted as restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards.
912750_17_ITEM8_P170_S3	We issue common shares on the grant date for restricted stock awards and on the exercise or vesting date for options and restricted stock units.
912750_17_ITEM8_P171_S0	At December 31, 2016 , our employees held approximately 1.6 million shares of non-vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units.
912750_17_ITEM8_P171_S1	These shares primarily vest over three to five years and vesting is dependent upon the employee s continued service with our Company.
912750_17_ITEM8_P171_S2	In addition, at December 31, 2016 , our employees held approximately 0.9 million shares of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting criteria (all of which are currently considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_17_ITEM8_P172_S0	The following table provides information about restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit activity.
912750_17_ITEM8_P173_S0	_________________ (1) In February 2016, we granted approximately 436,000 restricted stock units, which based on achievement of certain performance criteria, could vest within a range of 0% to 200% of shares granted upon completion of the performance period ending December 2018.
912750_17_ITEM8_P174_S0	The total fair value of all restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $39 million , $35 million and $43 million , respectively.
912750_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	Options generally expire ten years from the grant date and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_17_ITEM8_P175_S1	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the grant date.
912750_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_17_ITEM8_P176_S1	No stock options have been granted since 2008, except for ESPP options as discussed in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan section below.
912750_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following table provides information about outstanding stock options.
912750_17_ITEM8_P178_S0	_________________ (1) The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of our common stock at the indicated date, or at the time of exercise, exceeds the exercise price of the option.
912750_17_ITEM8_P179_S0	In May 2010, our stockholders approved the Newfield Exploration Company 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) with one million shares of our common stock available for issuance.
912750_17_ITEM8_P179_S1	Pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, for each six-month period beginning on January 1 or July 1 during the plan term, each eligible employee has the opportunity to purchase our common stock for a purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the first or last day of the period.
912750_17_ITEM8_P179_S2	Each employee may purchase up to $25,000 in common stock per calendar year.
912750_17_ITEM8_P179_S3	Employees of our China business are not eligible to participate in the plan.
912750_17_ITEM8_P179_S4	At December 31, 2016 , approximately 121,000 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the current plan.
912750_17_ITEM8_P180_S0	The fair value of the options granted was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method assuming no dividends and an expected life of six months.
912750_17_ITEM8_P180_S1	For the years ended December 31, our ESPP issuances and valuation assumptions consisted of the following:
912750_17_ITEM8_P181_S0	Liability awards consist of service-based awards that are settled in cash instead of shares, as discussed below.
912750_17_ITEM8_P182_S0	The value of the cash-settled restricted stock units, and the associated stock-based compensation expense, is based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.
912750_17_ITEM8_P182_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had a liability of $11 million for estimated future cash settlement upon vesting of awards.
912750_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	The following table provides information about cash-settled restricted stock unit activity.
912750_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	In 2013, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board approved the SVAP to be administered under the 2011 Plan.
912750_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	The SVAP paid substantially all full-time domestic, nonexecutive employees a cash payment based on a percentage of salary upon each incremental $5 increase in our 30 calendar-day average share price.
912750_17_ITEM8_P185_S1	Each price threshold could be reached only once during the term of the program.
912750_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	The first price threshold that triggered a payment under the SVAP was $27.50 during the fourth quarter of 2013.
912750_17_ITEM8_P186_S1	The second and third price thresholds for the SVAP were $32.50 and $37.50 , respectively, which were reached during the second quarter of 2014.
912750_17_ITEM8_P186_S2	The fourth price threshold for the SVAP of $42.50 was reached in July 2014.

912750_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	During 2010, our Board of Directors, with the recommendation of the Compensation Management Development Committee, approved a new annual cash incentive compensation plan for all employees (the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan).
912750_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	Under the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Management Development Committee determines the annual award pool for all employees based upon a number of factors including the Company s performance against stated performance goals and in comparison with peer companies in our industry.
912750_17_ITEM8_P190_S1	All employees are eligible if employed on October 1 and December 31 of the performance period.
912750_17_ITEM8_P190_S2	Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2010, our annual cash incentive compensation is paid in a single payment to employees during the first quarter after the performance period ends.

912750_17_ITEM8_P192_S1	This plan covers all of our employees, excluding those of our foreign subsidiaries.
912750_17_ITEM8_P192_S2	We match $1.00 for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an employee s salary, subject to limitations imposed by the IRS.
912750_17_ITEM8_P192_S3	We also sponsor a highly compensated employee deferred compensation plan.

912750_17_ITEM8_P193_S0	In May 2016, we announced plans to consolidate and reorganize domestic operating functions to our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas, which resulted in a significant reduction of employees located in the Tulsa, Oklahoma office during the third quarter of 2016.
912750_17_ITEM8_P193_S1	Our decision to restructure the organization was primarily in response to the oil and gas commodity price environment.
912750_17_ITEM8_P193_S2	Substantially all restructuring-related costs have been incurred as of December 31, 2016.
912750_17_ITEM8_P193_S3	We abandoned our Tulsa, Oklahoma office space during the third quarter of 2016 and recorded a liability for the remaining contracted payments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P194_S0	In April 2015, we announced plans to combine our onshore Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain business units.
912750_17_ITEM8_P194_S1	Our decision to restructure the organization, which only affected our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain business units, was primarily in response to the oil and gas commodity price environment.
912750_17_ITEM8_P194_S2	Substantially all restructuring-related costs were incurred by December 31, 2015.
912750_17_ITEM8_P194_S3	We abandoned our Denver, Colorado office space during the third quarter of 2015 and recorded a loss for the remaining contracted payments net of expected sublease income.

912750_17_ITEM8_P195_S0	Restructuring costs recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31 are set forth below.
912750_17_ITEM8_P196_S0	The following table summarizes our restructuring costs and related accruals.
912750_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	_________________ (1) Substantially all of the remaining liability relates to accrued losses on abandoned office space in Denver, Colorado and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
912750_17_ITEM8_P197_S1	This liability will be reduced by lease payments made on these leases over the next six years.
912750_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	While we only have operations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, we are organizationally structured along geographic operating segments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P198_S1	Our current operating segments are the United States and China.
912750_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	The following tables provide the geographic operating segment information for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
912750_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	Income tax allocations have been determined based on statutory rates in the applicable geographic segment.
912750_17_ITEM8_P199_S2	Our income tax allocation of our China operations is based on the combined statutory rates for China and the United States.
912750_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	The following table presents information about supplemental cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31:
912750_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	In 2013, we met the criteria to classify our Malaysia business as held for sale and discontinued operations.
912750_17_ITEM8_P201_S1	In February 2014, we closed the sale of our Malaysia business to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad (SapuraKencana), a Malaysian public company, for $898 million .
912750_17_ITEM8_P201_S2	As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain in the first quarter of 2014 of approximately $388 million ( $252 million , after tax).
912750_17_ITEM8_P201_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an allowance against a receivable from SapuraKencana and reduced the previously recognized gain by $15 million ( $10 million , after tax) due to uncertainty associated with collectability.
912750_17_ITEM8_P201_S4	There are no other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet attributable to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016 or 2015 .
912750_17_ITEM8_P202_S0	________________ (1) Certain payments to foreign governments made on our behalf that are part of the revenue process are recorded as a reduction of the related oil and gas revenues.
912750_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	Historically, our effective tax rate in Malaysia was approximately 38% .
912750_17_ITEM8_P203_S1	As a result of our December 2012 decision to repatriate earnings from our international operations, we experienced higher international effective tax rates due to these earnings being taxed in both the U.S. and the local country.
912750_17_ITEM8_P203_S2	The effective tax rate for our discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 37% , as the majority of our income from discontinued operations resulted from the gain on the sale of our Malaysia business, which was only taxable in the U.S.
912750_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	On January 23, 2017, we signed a sales agreement, subject to customary regulatory approval, with certain of our joint venture partners to divest our non-operated interest in the Bohai Bay field in China for approximately $39 million , subject to customary post-close adjustments.
912750_17_ITEM8_P204_S1	We expect that the sale will significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves for our China full cost pool, and as such, a gain or loss may be recognized upon closing.
912750_17_ITEM8_P204_S2	We expect this transaction to close in mid-2017.
912750_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	The results of operations by quarter for the indicated periods are as follows:
912750_17_ITEM8_P206_S0	_________________ (1) The sum of the individual quarterly earnings (loss) per share may not agree with year-to-date earnings (loss) per share as each quarterly computation is based on the income or loss for that quarter and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter.

912750_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_17_ITEM8_P211_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P211_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_17_ITEM8_P212_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into our reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.

912750_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	Our reserves estimates use available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data.
912750_17_ITEM8_P213_S1	Our petroleum engineering staff review estimates annually with management and revise the estimates, either upward or downward, as warranted by available data.
912750_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	pressures and individual well and field performance data.
912750_17_ITEM8_P214_S1	The data incorporated into our interpretations includes structure and isopach maps, individual well and field performance and other engineering and geological work products such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field projections.
912750_17_ITEM8_P214_S2	Additionally, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices factor into estimating quantities of reserves.
912750_17_ITEM8_P214_S3	Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental regulations, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with development drilling.
912750_17_ITEM8_P214_S4	Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner.
912750_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	The following is a discussion of our proved reserves and reserve additions and revisions.
912750_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	During 2016 , our proved reserves increased 4 MMBOE primarily as a result of positive performance revisions of 36 MMBOE and cost structure improvement revisions of 7 MMBOE.
912750_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	Performance revisions and cost structure improvements were partially offset by negative revisions of 22 MMBOE resulting from commodity price decreases.
912750_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	During 2016 , we added proved reserves of 77 MMBOE, which included 35 MMBOE of reserves purchased and 42 MMBOE added through extensions, discoveries and other additions, sold non-strategic assets of 35 MMBOE and produced 59 MMBOE.
912750_17_ITEM8_P216_S3	During 2015 , our proved reserves decreased 136 MMBOE primarily as a result of negative revisions of 286 MMBOE resulting from commodity price decreases.

912750_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	At the request of Newfield Exploration Company (Newfield), Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has conducted a reserves audit of the estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 prepared by Newfield s engineering and geological staff based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
912750_17_ITEM15_P156_S1	Our reserves audit, completed on January 18, 2017 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Newfield in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P156_S2	The estimated reserves shown herein represent Newfield s estimated net reserves attributable to the leasehold and royalty interests and derived through certain production sharing contracts in certain properties owned by Newfield and the portion of those reserves reviewed by Ryder Scott, as of December 31, 2016.
912750_17_ITEM15_P156_S3	The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott incorporate Newfield s reserve determinations and are located in the states of Montana, North Dakota, and Utah (Western Region); and offshore in the South China Sea (International Region).
912750_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott account for a portion of Newfield s total net proved reserves as of December 31, 2016.
912750_17_ITEM15_P157_S1	Based on the estimates of total net proved reserves prepared by Newfield, the reserves audit conducted by Ryder Scott addresses 49 percent of the total proved developed net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, 10 percent of the total proved developed net gas reserves, 16 percent of the total proved undeveloped net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, and 5 percent of the total proved undeveloped net gas reserves of Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P157_S2	On a barrel of oil equivalency basis, where 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas equal one barrel of oil equivalent, the properties reviewed by Ryder Scott represent 98 percent of Newfield s Western Region total net proved reserves and 44 percent of Newfield s International Region total net proved reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	As prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), a reserves audit is defined as the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed; (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon; (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process; (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used; and (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities.
912750_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Newfield, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Newfield in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Newfield are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards.
912750_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	In calculating whether the net remaining reserves were within tolerance, an equivalent unit basis was used wherein natural gas was converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	The estimated reserves presented in this report are related to hydrocarbon prices.
912750_17_ITEM15_P161_S1	Newfield has informed us that in the preparation of their reserve and income projections, as of December 31, 2016, they used average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P161_S2	Actual future prices may vary significantly from the prices required by SEC regulations; therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report.
912750_17_ITEM15_P161_S3	The net reserves as estimated by Newfield attributable to Newfield's interest in properties that we reviewed and for those that we did not review are summarized below:
912750_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in standard 42 gallon barrels and shown herein as thousand of barrels (MBBLS).
912750_17_ITEM15_P162_S1	All gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
912750_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
912750_17_ITEM15_P163_S1	An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled Petroleum Reserves Definitions is included as an attachment to this report.
912750_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	The various proved reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled Petroleum Reserves Status Definitions and Guidelines in this report.
912750_17_ITEM15_P164_S1	The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein are associated with the Greater Monument Butte Unit in Utah.
912750_17_ITEM15_P164_S2	These reserves consist of certain volumes attributable to future waterflood response in developed areas of the unit where water injection is ongoing or where the conversion of additional existing wells to injection is scheduled.
912750_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P165_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
912750_17_ITEM15_P165_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
912750_17_ITEM15_P165_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
912750_17_ITEM15_P165_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
912750_17_ITEM15_P165_S5	At Newfield s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
912750_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward.
912750_17_ITEM15_P166_S1	The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods.
912750_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.
912750_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	Proved reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
912750_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
912750_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
912750_17_ITEM15_P169_S2	Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
912750_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P170_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
912750_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures.
912750_17_ITEM15_P171_S1	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
912750_17_ITEM15_P171_S2	These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P171_S3	Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
912750_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
912750_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P173_S1	If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category assigned by the evaluator.
912750_17_ITEM15_P173_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable and/or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
912750_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely than not to be achieved.
912750_17_ITEM15_P174_S1	The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
912750_17_ITEM15_P174_S2	The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P174_S3	All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
912750_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available.
912750_17_ITEM15_P175_S1	Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein.
912750_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	The proved reserves, prepared by Newfield, for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a combination of methods.
912750_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	All of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods.
912750_17_ITEM15_P176_S2	These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data ending over a range from August through November 2016, depending on the availability for a given case and in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
912750_17_ITEM15_P176_S3	The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder Scott by Newfield or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
912750_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	All of the proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by analogy.
912750_17_ITEM15_P177_S1	The data utilized from the analogues were provided to Ryder Scott by Newfield or were obtained by us from public data sources that were available through November 2016.
912750_17_ITEM15_P177_S2	The data utilized from the analogues and incorporated into our analysis were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
912750_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves, many factors and assumptions are considered including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
912750_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_17_ITEM15_P179_S1	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in conducting this review.
912750_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	As stated previously, proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Newfield relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
912750_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	The hydrocarbon prices furnished by Newfield for the properties reviewed by us are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
912750_17_ITEM15_P181_S2	Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described.
912750_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	The initial SEC hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2016 for the properties reviewed by us were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold.
912750_17_ITEM15_P182_S1	These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein.
912750_17_ITEM15_P182_S2	The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used by Newfield for the geographic area(s) reviewed by us.
912750_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	The product prices which were actually used by Newfield to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, certain handling and processing fees, certain transportation costs, and/or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
912750_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	The differentials used by Newfield were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	The table below summarizes Newfield s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Newfield s average realized prices.
912750_17_ITEM15_P185_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Newfield s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Newfield s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
912750_17_ITEM15_P185_S2	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
912750_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in Newfield s individual property evaluations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved gas reserve estimates reviewed.
912750_17_ITEM15_P187_S1	The proved gas volumes presented herein include volumes of gas consumed in operations as reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P187_S2	These volumes have been offset with gas price reductions equivalent to the value of the consumed gas.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report were provided by Newfield and were represented to be based on their operating expense reports and to include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the COPAS overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S4	In the case of the international properties located offshore in the South China Sea, the cost recoverable expense and investment amounts have been deducted according to the terms of the Production Sharing Contracts.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S5	Furthermore, certain Windfall Profits Levy and Export Duty costs are included as Operating Cost deductions.
912750_17_ITEM15_P188_S6	For various U.S. properties, certain transportation, processing and handling fees which are separate for those mentioned above as price differentials are included as Other deductions.
912750_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	The operating costs provided to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the operating cost data used by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells.
912750_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	Development costs furnished by Newfield are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
912750_17_ITEM15_P190_S1	The development costs furnished by Newfield were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P190_S2	The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included by Newfield for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were significant.
912750_17_ITEM15_P190_S3	Newfield s estimates of the net abandonment costs were accepted without independent verification.
912750_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us have been incorporated herein in accordance with Newfield s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2016.
912750_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	The implementation of Newfield s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Newfield s management.
912750_17_ITEM15_P191_S2	As the result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Newfield has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Newfield s management at the appropriate local, regional and/or corporate level.
912750_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P192_S1	Additionally, Newfield has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, or political obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
912750_17_ITEM15_P192_S2	While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2016, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P193_S0	Current costs used by Newfield were held constant throughout the life of the properties.
912750_17_ITEM15_P194_S0	Newfield s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
912750_17_ITEM15_P194_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated.
912750_17_ITEM15_P194_S2	An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P194_S3	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
912750_17_ITEM15_P195_S0	Test data, analogy data and other related information were used by Newfield to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
912750_17_ITEM15_P195_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P195_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Newfield s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
912750_17_ITEM15_P195_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
912750_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions, producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
912750_17_ITEM15_P197_S0	Certain proved reserves associated with Newfield s international assets reported herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production, unless evidence indicates that contract renewal is reasonably certain.
912750_17_ITEM15_P197_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Newfield for the production of these volumes.
912750_17_ITEM15_P197_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
912750_17_ITEM15_P197_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Newfield the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
912750_17_ITEM15_P197_S4	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
912750_17_ITEM15_P197_S5	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Newfield s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
912750_17_ITEM15_P198_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Newfield operates or has interests.
912750_17_ITEM15_P199_S0	Newfield s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P199_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax, and foreign trade and investment and are subject to change from time to time.
912750_17_ITEM15_P200_S0	actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities.
912750_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a review of the properties in which Newfield owns and derives an interest; however, we have not made any field examination of the properties.
912750_17_ITEM15_P201_S1	No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included by Newfield for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
912750_17_ITEM15_P202_S0	Certain technical personnel of Newfield are responsible for the preparation of reserve estimates on new properties and for the preparation of revised estimates, when necessary, on old properties.
912750_17_ITEM15_P202_S1	These personnel assembled the necessary data and maintained the data and workpapers in an orderly manner.
912750_17_ITEM15_P202_S2	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our audit.
912750_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	Newfield has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P203_S1	In performing our audit of Newfield s forecast of future proved production, we have relied upon data furnished by Newfield with respect to property interests owned or derived, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, Production Sharing Contract terms, recompletion and development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, seismic analyses, core analyses, and pressure measurements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P203_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P203_S3	We consider the factual data furnished to us by Newfield to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of Newfield s estimates of reserves and future net income.
912750_17_ITEM15_P203_S4	In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Newfield and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
912750_17_ITEM15_P204_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Newfield, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Newfield in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Newfield are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards.
912750_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	We were in reasonable agreement with Newfield's estimates of proved reserves for the properties which we reviewed; although in certain cases there was more than an acceptable variance between Newfield's estimates and our estimates due to a difference in interpretation of data or due to our having access to data which were not available to Newfield when its reserve estimates were prepared.
912750_17_ITEM15_P205_S1	However not withstanding, it is our opinion that on an aggregate basis the data presented herein for the properties that we reviewed fairly reflects the estimated net reserves owned by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	Other properties, as used herein, are those properties of Newfield which we did not review.
912750_17_ITEM15_P206_S1	The proved net reserves attributable to the other properties account for 65 percent of the total proved net liquid hydrocarbon reserves and 92 percent of the total proved net gas reserves based on estimates prepared by Newfield as of December 31, 2016.

912750_17_ITEM15_P223_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
912750_17_ITEM15_P223_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
912750_17_ITEM15_P223_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
912750_17_ITEM15_P224_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
912750_17_ITEM15_P224_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
912750_17_ITEM15_P225_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P225_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
912750_17_ITEM15_P225_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
912750_17_ITEM15_P225_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
912750_17_ITEM15_P225_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
912750_17_ITEM15_P226_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
912750_17_ITEM15_P226_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
912750_17_ITEM15_P227_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
912750_17_ITEM15_P228_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
912750_17_ITEM15_P228_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
912750_17_ITEM15_P228_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
912750_17_ITEM15_P228_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
912750_17_ITEM15_P229_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P230_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
912750_17_ITEM15_P231_S0	of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
912750_17_ITEM15_P231_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
912750_17_ITEM15_P232_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
912750_17_ITEM15_P233_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
912750_17_ITEM15_P234_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
912750_17_ITEM15_P235_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_17_ITEM15_P235_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
912750_17_ITEM15_P236_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
912750_17_ITEM15_P236_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
912750_17_ITEM15_P236_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
912750_17_ITEM15_P237_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_17_ITEM15_P238_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P238_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
912750_17_ITEM15_P239_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
912750_17_ITEM15_P240_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
912750_17_ITEM15_P241_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_17_ITEM15_P242_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_17_ITEM15_P243_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
912750_17_ITEM15_P244_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_17_ITEM15_P244_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_17_ITEM15_P245_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
912750_17_ITEM15_P245_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
912750_17_ITEM15_P246_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_17_ITEM15_P247_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
912750_17_ITEM15_P248_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
912750_17_ITEM15_P249_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
912750_17_ITEM15_P250_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
912750_17_ITEM15_P251_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P252_S0	Developed Non-Producing Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P253_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
912750_17_ITEM15_P254_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
912750_17_ITEM15_P255_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
912750_17_ITEM15_P256_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_17_ITEM15_P257_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
912750_17_ITEM15_P258_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
912750_17_ITEM15_P259_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
912750_17_ITEM15_P260_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
912750_17_ITEM15_P261_S0	Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent Inc. 4 Waterway Square Place Suite 100 The Woodlands, Texas 77380 Ladies and Gentlemen:
912750_17_ITEM15_P261_S1	Pursuant to your request, we have conducted an audit of the estimates of the net proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas reserves, as of December 31, 2016, prepared by the engineering staff of Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent Inc. (Newfield) for working and royalty interests in Oklahoma that Newfield has represented it owns.
912750_17_ITEM15_P261_S2	This evaluation was completed on January 24, 2017.
912750_17_ITEM15_P261_S3	Newfield has represented to us that these properties account for approximately 92 percent on a net equivalent barrel basis of Newfield s net proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, and that the net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States.
912750_17_ITEM15_P261_S4	We have reviewed information provided to us by Newfield that it represents to be Newfield s estimates of the net reserves, as of December 31, 2016, for the same properties as those which we evaluated.
912750_17_ITEM15_P261_S5	This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P262_S0	Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves as represented by Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P262_S1	Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum remaining to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2016.
912750_17_ITEM15_P262_S2	Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by Newfield after deducting all interests owned by others.
912750_17_ITEM15_P263_S0	Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and gas reserves should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available.
912750_17_ITEM15_P264_S0	estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
912750_17_ITEM15_P265_S0	Data used in this audit were obtained from reviews with Newfield personnel, from Newfield files, from records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources.
912750_17_ITEM15_P265_S1	In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Newfield with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented.
912750_17_ITEM15_P265_S2	It was not considered necessary to make a field examination of the physical condition and operation of the properties.
912750_17_ITEM15_P266_S0	Methodology and Procedures Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).
912750_17_ITEM15_P266_S1	The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
912750_17_ITEM15_P267_S0	Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by Newfield, and the analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved.
912750_17_ITEM15_P268_S0	For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships.
912750_17_ITEM15_P268_S1	In the analyses of production decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production.
912750_17_ITEM15_P269_S0	In certain cases, when the previously named methods could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S0	Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S1	Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel use, flare, and shrinkage resulting from field separation and processing.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S2	Gas reserves are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at a pressure base of 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S3	Gas quantities included herein are expressed in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf).
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S4	Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are those to be recovered by conventional lease separation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S5	NGL reserves are those attributed to the leasehold interests according to processing agreements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S6	Oil, condensate, and NGL reserves included herein are expressed in barrels (bbl) representing 42 United States gallons per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S7	For reporting purposes, oil and condensate reserves have been estimated separately and are presented herein as a summed quantity.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S8	Definition of Reserves Petroleum reserves estimated by Newfield included in this report are classified as proved.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S9	Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report.
912750_17_ITEM15_P270_S10	Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC.
912750_17_ITEM15_P271_S0	Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment.
912750_17_ITEM15_P271_S1	In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_17_ITEM15_P271_S2	The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
912750_17_ITEM15_P272_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P272_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
912750_17_ITEM15_P273_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
912750_17_ITEM15_P274_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_17_ITEM15_P275_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_17_ITEM15_P276_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
912750_17_ITEM15_P277_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_17_ITEM15_P277_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12 month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_17_ITEM15_P278_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
912750_17_ITEM15_P279_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
912750_17_ITEM15_P280_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
912750_17_ITEM15_P281_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
912750_17_ITEM15_P282_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
912750_17_ITEM15_P283_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.4 10 (a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
912750_17_ITEM15_P284_S0	The following economic assumptions were used for estimating future prices and costs: Oil, Condensate, and NGL Prices Newfield has represented that the oil, condensate, and NGL prices were based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P284_S1	The oil, condensate, and NGL prices were calculated using differentials furnished by Newfield to the reference price of $42.82 per barrel.
912750_17_ITEM15_P284_S2	The resulting volume-weighted average price over the lives of the properties was $39.58 per barrel of oil and condensate and $10.51 per barrel of NGL.
912750_17_ITEM15_P285_S0	Gas Prices Newfield has represented that the gas prices were based on Henry Hub pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_17_ITEM15_P285_S1	The gas prices were calculated for each property using differentials furnished by Newfield to the reference price of $2.48 per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and held constant thereafter.
912750_17_ITEM15_P285_S2	The resulting volume-weighted average price over the lives of the properties was $1.848 per thousand cubic feet.
912750_17_ITEM15_P286_S0	Production Taxes Production taxes were calculated using the tax rates for Oklahoma.
912750_17_ITEM15_P286_S1	Operating Expenses, Capital Costs, and Abandonment Costs Estimates of operating expenses, provided by Newfield and based on current expenses, were held constant for the lives of the properties.
912750_17_ITEM15_P286_S2	Future capital expenditures were estimated using 2016 values, provided by Newfield, and were not adjusted for inflation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P286_S3	Abandonment costs were included for all properties.
912750_17_ITEM15_P287_S0	Newfield has represented that its estimated net proved reserves attributable to the reviewed properties are based on the definitions of proved reserves of the SEC.
912750_17_ITEM15_P287_S1	Newfield has represented that its estimates of the net proved reserves attributable to these properties, which represent 92 percent of Newfield s total proved reserves on a net equivalent basis, are as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf), and thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe):
912750_17_ITEM15_P288_S0	In comparing the detailed net proved reserves estimates prepared by us and by Newfield of the properties audited, we have found differences, both positive and negative, resulting in an aggregate difference of 4.0 percent for the properties audited when compared on the basis of net barrels equivalent.
912750_17_ITEM15_P288_S1	It is our opinion that there is no material difference between the net proved reserves estimates prepared by Newfield and those prepared by us for those properties we audited.
912750_17_ITEM15_P289_S0	932-235-50, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932): Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S K of the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided, however, that estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year.
912750_17_ITEM15_P290_S0	To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.
912750_17_ITEM15_P291_S0	While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant s ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the December 31, 2016, estimated oil, condensate, NGL, and gas reserves.
912750_17_ITEM15_P292_S0	DeGolyer and MacNaughton is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1936.
912750_17_ITEM15_P292_S1	DeGolyer and MacNaughton does not have any financial interest, including stock ownership, in Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P292_S2	Our fees were not contingent on the results of our evaluation.
912750_17_ITEM15_P292_S3	This letter report has been prepared at the request of Newfield.
912750_17_ITEM15_P292_S4	DeGolyer and MacNaughton has used all data, assumptions, procedures, and methods that it considers necessary to prepare this report.
912750_17_ITEM15_P293_S0	I, Gregory K. Graves, Petroleum Engineer with DeGolyer and MacNaughton, 5001 Spring Valley Road, Suite 800 East, Dallas, Texas, 75244 U.S.A., hereby certify:
912750_17_ITEM15_P294_S0	That I am a Senior Vice President with DeGolyer and MacNaughton, which company did prepare the letter report addressed to Newfield dated January 24, 2017, and that I, as Senior Vice President, was responsible for the preparation of this letter report.
912750_17_ITEM15_P295_S0	That I attended the University of Texas at Austin, and that I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering in the year 1984; that I am a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas; that I am a member of the International Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers; and that I have in excess of 32 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserves evaluations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our revenues, profitability, cash flows and future growth, as well as liquidity and ability to access additional sources of capital, depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and the relative mix of these commodities in our reserves and production.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Sustained lower prices will reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce and may result in impairments of our proved reserves or reduction of our proved undeveloped reserves.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Oil, natural gas and NGL prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	See Items 1 and 2, " Business and Properties 2018 Outlook," for additional information about the commodity price environment.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Some, but not all, of the factors that can cause fluctuations include:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	While we cannot predict commodity prices, we have previously made adjustments in response to the then current strong supply and relatively soft demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, such as adapting our 2017 capital investment plan to reflect anticipated commodity prices, historical drilling success, and markets for our products.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In the current commodity price environment, we have increased our 2018 capital investment plan, but this capital investment plan is subject to adjustments such as those taken in 2017.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These adjustments are likely to influence our profitability and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, our stock price in the market is influenced by fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Sustained material declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may have the following effects on our business:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	reduce the carrying value of our assets in our balance sheet through ceiling test impairments.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may be responsible for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Under state and federal law, oil and gas companies are obligated to plug and abandon (P A) a well and restore the lease to pre-operating conditions after operations cease.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	U.S. state and federal regulations allow the government to call upon predecessors in interest of oil and gas leases to pay for P A, restoration and decommissioning obligations if the current operator fails to fulfill those obligations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Moreover, offshore P A liabilities can be very significant.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As part of our strategic shift from offshore Gulf of Mexico operations to onshore U.S. operations, we divested our assets on the outer continental shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In connection with those divestitures, we entered into various arrangements with the purchasers whereby the purchasers assumed our P A liabilities and other liabilities related to decommissioning such GoM assets.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Since we entered into these arrangements, several onshore and offshore E P companies have sought bankruptcy protection.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If purchasers of our former GoM assets, or any successor owners of those assets, are unable to meet their P A and other decommissioning obligations due to bankruptcy, dissolution or other related liquidity issues, we may be unable to rely on our arrangements with them to fulfill (or provide reimbursement for) those obligations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In those circumstances, the government may seek to impose the bankrupt entity s P A obligations on us and any other predecessors in interest.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Such payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Moreover, recent changes to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management s (BOEM) bonding requirements have the potential to adversely impact the financial condition of operators in the GoM and increase the number of operators seeking bankruptcy protection, given the current commodities market.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	In July 2016, BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) that augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees, among others, to assure that sufficient funds are available to perform decommissioning obligations with respect to offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S8	The NTL, which became effective in September 2016, eliminates the agency s past practice of waiving supplemental bonding obligations where a company could demonstrate a certain level of financial strength.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Instead, BOEM will allow companies to "self-insure," but only up to 10% of a company s "tangible net worth," which is defined as the difference between a company s total assets and the value of all liabilities and intangible assets.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The NTL provides new procedures for how BOEM determines a lessee s decommissioning obligations, and the agency continues to negotiate with offshore operators to post additional financial assurance and develop tailored plans to meet BOEM s revised estimates for offshore decommissioning obligations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Projected decommissioning costs of operations in the GoM continue to increase, and the volatile price of oil and gas has adversely affected the net worth of many operators.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	BOEM s revisions to its supplemental bonding process could result in demands for the posting of increased financial assurance by the entities to whom we divested our GoM assets as well as other operators in the GoM. This will force operators to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the costs of which could be significant.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Moreover, BOEM s NTL is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which will in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, exceed the surety bond market s ability to provide such additional financial assurance.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the volatile oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety may have about the priority of their lien on the operators' collateral.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Consequently, BOEM s changes could result in additional operators in the GoM initiating bankruptcy proceedings, which in turn could result in the government seeking to impose P A costs on predecessors in interest in the event that the current operator cannot meet its P A obligations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	As a result, we could find ourselves liable to pay for the P A costs of any entity we divested our GoM assets to, which payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity in Oklahoma and elsewhere could increase our costs of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Water sourcing, use and disposal are common practices in oil and gas operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We dispose of large volumes of water produced alongside oil and natural gas produced water or "saltwater" in connection with our drilling and production operations, pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	While these permits are issued under existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There exists a growing concern that the injection of produced water into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic events in certain areas, including Oklahoma, where we operate.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	contributed to increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells that are located in close proximity to areas of increased seismic activity.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) evaluates existing disposal wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to faults, seismicity and other factors, with well operators in certain geographic locations required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, the OCC has adopted rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct additional mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells to shallower depths and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within Areas of Interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	For example, OCC has established a 15 thousand square mile Area of Interest in the Arbuckle formation located primarily north and east of the Anadarko Basin in the Mississippi Lime play.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Since 2013, OCC has prohibited disposal into the basement rock and ordered reduction of disposal volumes into the overlying Arbuckle formation and directed the shut-in of a number of Arbuckle disposal wells in response to seismic activity.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	In addition, in January 2016, the Governor of Oklahoma announced a grant of $1.4 million in emergency funds to support earthquake research to be directed by the OCC and the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS).
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	During September and November 2016, in response to the occurrence of earthquakes in Cushing and Pawnee, Oklahoma, located in the northeast area of the Anadarko Basin, the OCC developed action plans in conjunction with the OGS and the EPA.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The plans require reductions in disposal volumes in three concentric zones from the center of the earthquake activity in both Cushing and Pawnee, Oklahoma, with the greatest reductions in the zone located closest to the center of the largest quakes.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These actions are in addition to any previous orders to shut in wells or reduce disposal volumes.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Prior measures had already reduced disposal volumes in the areas of concern by up to 50 percent for some disposal wells.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In the Pawnee area, the action plan covers a total of 38 Arbuckle disposal wells under OCC jurisdiction and 26 Arbuckle disposal wells under EPA jurisdiction and in the Cushing area the plan covers a total of 58 Arbuckle disposal wells.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Local residents have also recently filed lawsuits against saltwater disposal well operators in these areas for damages resulting from the increased seismic activity.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Additionally, in recent years there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to induce seismic events.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P13_S7	In December 2016, the OCC announced the development of seismicity guidelines focused on operators in SCOOP and STACK to directly address concerns related to induced seismicity and hydraulic fracturing.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The OCC has established three action levels to be followed if events are detected at a M2.5 or above and within 1.24 miles (2 km) of hydraulic fracturing activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	On March 1, 2017, the OCC also issued a statement saying that further actions to reduce the earthquake rate in Oklahoma could be expected.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Restrictions on disposal well volumes or a lack of sufficient disposal wells, the filing of lawsuits, or curtailment or restrictions on oil and gas activity generally in response to concerns related to induced seismicity, could cause us to delay, curb or discontinue our exploration and development plans.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Increased costs associated with restrictions on hydraulic fracturing or the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal or hydraulic fracturing, such as mandated produced water recycling in some portion or all of our operations or prohibitions on performing hydraulic fracturing in certain areas, may reduce our profitability.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	These developments may result in additional levels of regulation, or increased complexity and costs with respect to existing regulations, that could lead to operational delays or increased operating and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our use of oil, natural gas and NGL price derivative contracts may limit future revenues and cash flows from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	maintain our current derivative positions in the future specifically could result in financial losses or could reduce our income and cash flows .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As part of our risk management program, we generally use derivative contracts to protect a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil, gas and NGL production to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	A portion of our oil derivative contracts include sold puts.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If market prices remain below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the difference between our floors or swaps and the associated sold puts, limiting the downside protection of these contracts.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In the case of acquisitions, we may use derivative contracts to protect acquired production from commodity price volatility for a longer period.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	While the use of derivative contracts may limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the volume subject to derivative contracts, there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the derivative transactions or there are issues with regard to the legal enforceability of such instruments.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The use of derivative transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to perform their financial and other obligations under such transactions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts, enter receivership or seek bankruptcy or similar protection, that could result in an economic loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened, and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Additionally, in the past we have concluded that utilizing derivative contracts to lock in historically low prices for oil and natural gas for some of our anticipated future production is not in the best interest of the Company, and we may come to that conclusion again in the future.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	As a result, a meaningful portion of our future oil production could remain unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If we are ultimately unable to, or choose not to, hedge additional expected oil production volumes for future periods, we will be subject to further potential commodity price volatility, which may result in lower than expected cash flows, revenues and income.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our limited hedging of our NGL production and commodity basis differentials could adversely impact our cash flows and revenue.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S7	The market for hedging NGL and commodity basis differentials is less robust than for oil and natural gas priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S8	The current direct NGL and commodity basis differential hedging market is constrained in terms of price, volume, duration and number of counterparties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S9	This limits our ability to hedge our NGL production and price difference based on point of sale effectively or at all.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S10	As a result, currently, we primarily hedge our oil and natural gas production priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively, and only recently began hedging a small portion of our NGL production.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S11	If the current price levels for NGLs continue or decrease in the future or the commodity basis differentials versus WTI or Henry Hub negatively increase, such as is the case with respect to our wax crude oil production, our cash flows and results of operations would be affected.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S12	We have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans that could be greater than cash flows from operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Limited liquidity would likely negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S14	Our 2018 capital investment levels may exceed our projected cash flows from operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S15	As a result, we may use available cash or borrow funds under our credit facility, due in part to our decision to continue our drilling program in order to avoid future lease renewals to retain certain acreage.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S16	If necessary, we may continue to use cash on hand, sell non- strategic assets or potentially access public debt and/or equity markets to fund any shortfall.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S17	Our ability to generate operating cash flows is subject to many risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells; prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs; production costs; availability of economical gathering, processing, storage and transportation in our operating areas; our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S18	Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, unbudgeted acquisitions and the promulgation of new regulatory requirements.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S19	In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or changes in drilling plans.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P20_S20	Alternatively, we may have to reduce capital expenditures, and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected, if:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	we are unable to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our level of indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we had total indebtedness of $2.4 billion .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The indentures governing our outstanding notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations contain, and any indenture that will govern other debt securities issued by us and any future agreements governing our other indebtedness and financial obligations may contain, various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to, among other things:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These restrictions and our level of indebtedness could limit our ability to:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions, and to comply with other covenants and restrictions in our financing agreements, can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control, such as a volatile commodity cost environment or an economic downturn.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Accordingly, we may be unable to meet these obligations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	This failure could impair our results of operations and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Our breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness, which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, or repay such debt with the proceeds from a sale of assets or a public offering of securities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Factors that will affect our ability to successfully complete a public offering, refinance our debt or conduct an asset sale include financial market conditions and our market value, asset valuations and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating agencies.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of capital, our ability to issue future debt under terms similar to our existing debt or our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If we were downgraded, it could be difficult for us to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	See Note 11 , " Debt ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex and inexact.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The process relies on interpretations of geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The extent, quality and reliability of these data can vary.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The process also requires a number of economic assumptions, such as oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the relative mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs that will be ultimately produced, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the effect of government regulation, taxes and availability of funds.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, future oil, natural gas and NGL production and the relative mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs that will be ultimately produced, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, effects of regulations, funding availability and drilling and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use, which include the use of multiple technologies, data sources and interpretation methods, may be different than those used by our competitors.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability, particularly in the early stages of development.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Any significant variance could be systematic and undetected for an extended period of time, which would materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	In addition, we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil, natural gas and NGL prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In accordance with SEC requirements, we calculate the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves using the SEC s pricing methodology for calculating proved reserves, adjusted for market differentials and costs in effect at year end discounted at 10%.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used as of the date of an estimate.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new reserves .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties, we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	However, as we produce from our properties, our reserves decline.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, the decline in our reserves will eventually result in a decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL production and lower revenue, income and cash flows from operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Future oil, natural gas and NGL production is, therefore, highly dependent on our success in efficiently finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S8	We may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost, if at all.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P30_S9	In addition, these activities require substantial capital expenditures.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test impairments in the past and may result in future ceiling test or other impairments .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test impairment to the extent of such excess.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If required, a ceiling test impairment reduces income and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	The risk that we will be required to further impair the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas or NGL prices are low or volatile for a prolonged period of time.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, or if estimated future development costs increase.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Drilling is a costly and high-risk activity .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil, natural gas or NGLs are present or may be produced economically.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, we are often uncertain of the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	compliance with, or changes in, environmental, tax and other laws and regulations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	As we implement pad development and increase the lateral length and size of hydraulic fracturing stimulations of our horizontal wells, the costs and other impacts associated with any curtailment, delay or cancellation may increase due to the concentration of capital expenditures prior to bringing production online.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Future drilling activities may not be successful, and if unsuccessful, this could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas, including the risk of:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase and lease.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If any of these risks occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	repairs and remediation costs to resume operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The magnitude of these risks may increase due to the increase in lateral length, larger multi-stage hydraulic fracturing stimulations for our horizontal wells and the implementation of pad development because of the larger amounts of liquids, chemicals and proppants involved.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Further, offshore operations are subject to a variety of additional operating risks, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from typhoons or other adverse weather conditions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These conditions could cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our China operations are dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Necessary infrastructures have been in the past, and may be in the future, temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons, or they may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	For example, production from our operated Pearl field in the South China Sea was suspended during the third quarter of 2017 due to a mechanical issue associated with a third-party floating production, storage and offloading vessel located approximately 10 miles from the field, resulting in only one lifting during the quarter.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Regions in which we operate have recently experienced drought conditions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs related to finding alternative water sources.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks or natural disasters, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Catastrophic occurrences giving rise to litigation, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses, as well as governmental fines and penalties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	If our production is interrupted significantly, our efforts at containment are ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and in turn, our results of operations, could be materially and adversely affected.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In connection with our operations, we generally require our contractors, which include the contractor, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliate companies, its subcontractors, their agents, employees, directors and officers, to agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees, contractors, subcontractors, agents and directors, and any property damage suffered by the contractors.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	There may be times, however, that we are required to indemnify our contractors for injuries and other losses resulting from the events described above, which indemnification claims could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Contractor or customer contracts may also contain inadequate indemnity clauses, exposing us to unexpected losses or an unfavorable litigation position, and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	While we maintain insurance against some potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	cash flows and the funds available to us for our exploration, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity, and other factors.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling in these projects.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Additionally, as we transition STACK and SCOOP to pad development, there may be significant delays in bringing new wells online, which could result in inconsistent growth and possibly short term declines in our production from those plays.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S7	Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S8	In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S9	As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S10	Currently low oil prices, reduced capital spending and numerous other factors, many of which are beyond our control, could result in our failure to establish production on undeveloped acreage, and, if we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S11	The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 73% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P44_S12	At that date, we had leases representing approximately 80,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2018 , approximately 56,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2019 , and approximately 29,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in 2020 .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	At December 31, 2017 , approximately 41% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Our reserve estimates assume we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	These assumptions, however, may not prove to be accurate.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S7	We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled, or that the results of such development will be as estimated.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S8	If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S9	In addition, under the SEC s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S10	A removal of such reserves could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P45_S11	The potential adoption of federal, state, tribal and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on almost all of our U.S. onshore oil and natural gas properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand or other proppant materials, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Certain municipalities have already banned hydraulic fracturing, and courts have upheld those moratoria in some instances.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	In the past several years, dozens of states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	cash flows or financial condition " for more information on action taken by certain states to regulate hydraulic fracturing activity.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	At the federal level, the EPA has taken numerous actions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	See Items 1 and 2, " Business and Properties Regulation Environmental Regulations Hydraulic Fracturing ," for more information on such actions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The adoption of new federal rules or regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could require us to obtain additional permits or approvals or to install expensive pollution control equipment for our operations, which in turn could lead to increased operating costs, delays and curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which in turn could materially adversely affect our operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The final report concluded that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources "under some circumstances," noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, we do not believe that this multi-year study report provides any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Development activities require the use of water.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	For example, the hydraulic fracturing process that we employ to produce commercial quantities of NGLs, natural gas and oil from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water in addition to the water we use to develop our waterflood in the GMBU.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In certain regions, there may be insufficient local capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In these cases, water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site, adding to the operating cost.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations, such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of NGLs, natural gas and oil.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In recent history, public concern surrounding increased seismicity has heightened focus on our industry s use of water in operations, which may cause increased costs, regulations or environmental initiatives impacting our use or disposal of water.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	See the risk factor " Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity in Oklahoma and elsewhere could increase our costs of compliance or lead to operational delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition " for more information on action taken by certain states to regulate hydraulic fracturing activity with respect to induced seismicity.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Furthermore, future environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells could cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, which may result in increased operating costs and have an effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We deliver oil, natural gas and NGLs through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	other reasons, or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	New regulations on the transportation of oil by rail, like those finalized by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2015, may increase our transportation costs.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, infrastructure or capacity constraints and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport natural gas.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	We may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Like many companies in the oil and gas industry, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S7	Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S8	In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S9	Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P55_S10	Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Existing and potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulation.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental, natural resource protection, and other governmental regulations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Matters subject to regulation include the following, in addition to the other matters discussed under the caption " Regulation " in Items 1 and 2 of this report:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource risk mitigation, damages and other environmental or habitat damages.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We also could be required to install and operate expensive pollution controls, engage in environmental risk management, incur increased waste disposal costs, or limit or even cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The matters described above and other potential legislative proposals, along with any applicable legislation introduced and passed in Congress or new rules or regulations promulgated by state or the US federal government, could increase our costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows, in addition to the demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of "greenhouse gases" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things address GHG emissions for certain sources.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Severe limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for natural gas, oil and NGL.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We could be adversely affected by the credit risk of financial institutions .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds and other institutions.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	In the event of default of a counterparty, we would be exposed to credit risks.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P62_S4	We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative contracts and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In addition, if any lender under our credit facility or our money market lines of credit is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our credit facility or our money market lines of credit.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Some of our purchasers and non-operating partners may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in financial losses.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Federal legislation regarding swaps could adversely affect the costs of, or our ability to enter into, those transactions .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010, amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, and swaps market participants, such as Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain swaps to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, unless an exception from mandatory clearing is available, and if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	To date, the CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The CFTC has not yet required the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including commodity swaps.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the clearing requirement for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, along with changes to the markets for swaps as a result of the trade execution requirement, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P64_S5	If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in our revenues and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Therefore, we are unable to determine the future costs on our derivative activities at this time.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Higher costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Act can create disincentives for end-users like Newfield to hedge their commercial risks, including market price fluctuations associated with anticipated production of oil and gas.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S5	The Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations promulgated by CFTC could potentially increase the cost of Newfield s risk management activities, which could adversely affect our available liquidity, materially alter the terms of our swap contracts, reduce the availability of swaps to hedge or mitigate risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing swap contracts, and increase our regulatory compliance costs related to our swap activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S6	In addition, if we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, including by becoming more volatile and less predictable, which also could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P65_S7	It is also possible that the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations could affect prices for commodities that we purchase, use or sell, which, in turn, could adversely affect our liquidity, revenues, cash flows and financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In December 2013, the CFTC re-proposed rules to amend the CEA to establish position limits for certain commodity futures and options contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts, including those derivative instruments that we use.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	If the CFTC position limit regulations are ultimately adopted substantially in the form proposed, they could result in additional compliance costs and alter our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Until the CFTC adopts final rules with respect to position limits and any exemptions for bona fide derivative transactions or off-setting positions from those limits, we will be unable to determine whether the CFTC s proposed rules could result in additional derivative costs or adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our commercial risks.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	To the extent Newfield transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	A substantial majority of our producing properties are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	A substantial majority of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	At December 31, 2017 , 70% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in these areas.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Additionally, in November 2018 voters are likely to consider a ballot measure that would raise gross production taxes on wells drilled on or after July 1, 2015, from the current rate of 2 percent for 36 months and 7 percent thereafter for the life of the well to a flat rate of 7 percent.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Such an increase in taxes could affect the economic viability of future drilling locations and current wells, affect our operating income and costs, possibly resulting in reserve reductions and impairments, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Some of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established on the leases or units containing the leasehold acreage .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , approximately 80% of our total net acreage was held by production.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Leases on oil and gas properties normally have a term of three to five years and will expire unless, prior to expiration of the lease term, production in paying quantities is established.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If the leases expire and we are unable to renew them, we will lose the right to develop the related properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	The risk of the foregoing increases in periods of sustained low commodity prices due to the corresponding impact on our drilling plans and the likely decrease in what is considered economic production under the leases.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including commodity prices, drilling results, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Although these provisions were largely unchanged in the Tax Act, which was signed on December 22, 2017, Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Moreover, other more general features of any additional tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted in future legislation and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We have risks associated with our China operations .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Ownership of property interests and production operations in China are subject to the various risks inherent in international operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our China operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Our China operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation, investment and transparency issues.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our China operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non-U.S. courts or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Competition for, or the loss of, our senior management or experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	To a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel and the loss of any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a seasoned management team and experienced explorationists, engineers, geologists and other professionals.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	In the past, competition for these professionals was strong, and in a continuing price recovery environment may become strong again, which could result in future retention and attraction issues.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Our competitors include multinational oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield services.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	In addition, high commodity prices, asset valuations and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly increase the cost of available properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	As a consequence, our competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Shortages of oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified field personnel could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing stimulation equipment and crews, and other oilfield equipment as demand for that equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S6	The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells, conduct hydraulic fracturing stimulations and conduct field operations can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S7	These factors have caused significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S8	Higher oil, natural gas, and NGL prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs and crews, hydraulic fracturing stimulation equipment and crews and associated supplies, equipment, services and raw materials.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S9	Similarly, lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices generally result in a decline in service costs due to reduced demand for drilling and completion services.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S10	Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some oilfield equipment, services and supplies.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S11	However, if the current oil and gas market changes, and commodity prices continue to recover, we may face shortages of field personnel, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing stimulation equipment and crews or other equipment or supplies, which could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or restrict operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S12	We may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S13	Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas, such as well blowouts, explosions, oil spills, releases of gas or well fluids, fires, pollution and adverse weather conditions, which could result in substantial losses to us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S14	Exploration and production activities are also subject to risk from political developments such as terrorist acts, piracy, civil disturbances, war, expropriation or nationalization of assets, which can cause loss of or damage to our property.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S15	We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S16	Our insurance includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits and/or self-insurance.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S17	Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S18	Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S19	We can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S20	We currently have insurance policies covering our onshore and offshore operations that include coverage for general liability, excess liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of wells, oil pollution, third- party liability, workers compensation and employers liability and other coverages.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S21	Consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution and other environmental issues, with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P82_S22	For example, we maintain operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that we may incur from a sudden incident that results in negative environmental effects, including obligations, expenses or claims related to seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).
912750_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be our primary source of coverage, with the general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	In the event we make a claim under our insurance policies, we will be subject to the credit risk of the insurers.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the credit quality of our insurers and impact their ability to pay claims.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Further, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If we incur substantial liability from a significant event and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then we would have lower revenues and funds available to us for our operations, that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We may face various risk associated with the long term trend toward increased activism against oil and gas exploration and development activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Opposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, environmental compliance and business practices.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as the development of oil or gas shale plays.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P87_S3	For example, environmental activists continue to advocate for increased regulations or bans on shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the United States, even in jurisdictions that are among the most stringent in their regulation of the industry.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Future activist efforts could result in the following:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We may need to incur significant costs associated with responding to these initiatives.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Complying with any resulting additional legal or regulatory requirements that are substantial could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and divestitures .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	As part of our business strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make acquisitions of oil and gas properties and to divest non-strategic assets.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Suitable acquisition properties or suitable buyers of our non-strategic assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or not at all.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	These risks include that the acquired properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flows at anticipated levels.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P90_S2	Also, the integration of properties we acquire could be difficult.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P90_S3	In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P90_S4	The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:
912750_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	These assessments are complex and the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	In addition, our divestitures may pose significant residual risks to the Company, such as divestitures where we retain certain liabilities or we have legal successor liability due to the bankruptcy or dissolution of the purchaser.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P91_S4	Generally, uneconomic or unsuccessful acquisitions and divestitures may divert management s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P91_S5	We depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S3	We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S5	It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S6	We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any cyber incidents or interruptions to our arrangements with third parties, to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse or destruction of proprietary or other information, or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P92_S7	As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow due to the impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow of our customers.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, some of our arrangements with employees and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of us .
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S5	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to affect a change of control, to acquire us or to replace incumbent management, including, for example, limitations on stockholders ability to remove directors, call special meetings and to propose and nominate directors or otherwise propose actions for approval at stockholder meetings, as well as the ability of our board of directors to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P93_S6	In addition, our change of control severance plan, change of control severance agreements with certain officers and our omnibus stock plans and deferred compensation plan contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of equity awards and acceleration of deferred compensation, upon a change of control.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, or could reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of us.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Delays in obtaining licenses, permits, and other government authorizations required to conduct our operations could adversely affect our business.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Our operations require licenses, permits, and in some cases renewals of licenses and permits from various governmental authorities.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Our ability to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to changes in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable government agencies, among other factors.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Our inability to obtain, or our loss of or denial of extension, to any of these licenses or permits could hamper our ability to produce income, revenues or cash flows from our operations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the interest under the property.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	As we continue to expand our operations in Oklahoma, North Dakota or Utah, we may operate within the boundaries of Native American reservations and become subject to certain tribal laws and regulations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations applies to operators and other parties within the boundaries of Native American reservations in the United States.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the EPA, together with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American reservations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P97_S3	These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, tribal employment contractor preferences and numerous other matters.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and BLM.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	However, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation and has the right to enact and enforce certain other laws and regulations entirely independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations, as long as they do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	These tribal laws and regulations include various fees, taxes, requirements to employ Native American tribal members or use tribal owned service businesses and numerous other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations within the boundaries of a Native American reservation.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation are often subject to the Native American tribal court system, unless there is a specific waiver of sovereign immunity by the Native American tribe allowing resolution of disputes between the Native American tribe and those lessees or operators to occur in federal or state court.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	We therefore may become subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations.
912750_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	One or more of these Native American requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits necessary to operate on tribal lands pursuant to these regulations, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project on those lands.
912750_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 19, 2017, we received notice of a request for arbitration from SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad (SapuraKencana), the purchaser of our Malaysian business in February 2014.
912750_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	SapuraKencana is asserting that the Company owes approximately $89 million in damages for breach of contract and for a tax indemnity, plus interest and legal and other costs.
912750_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	We filed our response to the request for arbitration in December 2017.
912750_18_ITEM3_P1_S3	We continue to be committed to fully contesting the claims and intend to vigorously defend the Company's interest.
912750_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	In August 2016, the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) announced its intent to resolve alleged systemic violations of the North Dakota air pollution control laws, N.D.C.C. ch.
912750_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	33-15, the North Dakota State Implementation Plan, and those provisions of the federal Clean Air Act and its body of implementing regulations for which the NDDH has been delegated authority by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at certain facilities in North Dakota, including facilities owned and operated by the Company, through a voluntary Consent Decree process.
912750_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Company entered into a Consent Decree in February 2017 that includes a payment of civil penalties, imposes additional facility design review and, potentially, air permitting obligations, as well as enhanced maintenance and inspection program obligations, but does not contain any admission of liability.
912750_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Consent Decree was approved by the North Dakota District Court in Burleigh County on March 14, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM3_P2_S4	The Consent Decree is subject to termination upon consent from the NDDH that all obligations of the Consent Decree have been completed or after two years, the Company may petition the court for termination.
912750_18_ITEM3_P2_S5	The Company paid the penalty in September 2017, which was less than $1 million.
912750_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	In addition, from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate related to alleged violations of environmental statutes or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
912750_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	We cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines or penalties, or if such fines or penalties are imposed, that they would individually or in the aggregate exceed $100,000.
912750_18_ITEM3_P3_S2	If any federal government fines or penalties are in fact imposed that are greater than $100,000, then we will disclose such fact in our subsequent filings.
912750_18_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the names, ages (as of February 15, 2018 ) and positions held by our executive officers.

912750_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	_________________ (1) Continuing operations only (excludes Malaysia, which was sold in February 2014).
912750_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
912750_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our U.S. operations are onshore and focus primarily on large scale, liquids-rich resource plays in the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Uinta Basin of Utah.
912750_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	In addition, we have a producing oil field offshore China.
912750_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace produced reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our revenues, profitability, cash flows and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and on our ability to find, acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
912750_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely and affect:
912750_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	the amount of cash flows available for capital investments; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce.
912750_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	For a summary of our 2017 highlights and outlook for 2018 see Item 1 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect a partial reversal of commodity price decreases that started in late 2014.
912750_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	After experiencing lower realized prices for oil and natural gas in 2015 and 2016, which negatively impacted revenues during those periods, prices strengthened in 2017 resulting in an increase in consolidated revenues of approximately $388 million versus 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Partially offsetting the impact of higher realized prices on 2017 revenues was a decrease in production in China due to the sale of our interest in the Bohai Bay field in May of 2017, and natural declines in our Pearl field, combined with the mid-year suspension of production in the field due to a mechanical issue associated with the third-party operated FPSO.
912750_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	Domestic production increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016 and 8% in 2016 compared to 2015.
912750_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	The average oil price we received decreased from 2015 through late 2016 primarily due to continued high global petroleum inventories and strong supply growth from OPEC.
912750_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Oil prices began to improve in late 2016 following OPEC s decision to curb production for the first six months of 2017, and with the announcement in May 2017 that these production cuts would extend into 2018.
912750_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	Furthermore, the domestic oil markets have rebounded despite the rise in U.S. shale oil supply due to strengthening in the U.S. and global economies.
912750_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	NGL prices rebounded significantly in 2017 due to increased propane exports which led to lower U.S.inventory levels.
912750_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	Natural gas prices partially recovered in 2017 due to inventory draw downs caused by greater exports and growth in industrial demand.
912750_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Domestic production increases over the three-year period were primarily the result of our drilling programs in the Anadarko Basin, partially offset by the sale of our Texas assets in 2016 and the natural declines in areas where drilling activity has been reduced or eliminated.
912750_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following table reflects our production/liftings and average realized commodity prices (excluding the impact of commodity derivative gains and losses):
912750_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	_________________ (2) Represents our net share of volumes sold regardless of when produced.
912750_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following table presents information about operating expenses:
912750_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , total operating expenses per BOE decreased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to ceiling test impairments in 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Lease operating expense per BOE decreased 4% primarily due to an increased concentration of total production in STACK where operating costs are lower.
912750_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Total lease operating expense was flat period over period due to increased production, higher well servicing costs in the Williston Basin and additional costs incurred to protect our wells against offset hydraulic fracturing operations by other operators in the Williston Basin, offset by the reduction of costs associated with the sale of our Texas assets in the third quarter of 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Transportation and processing expense per BOE increased 8% due to increased oil deficiency fees of $13 million in the Uinta Basin and higher utilization of oil pipelines in the STACK play, which allows us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a higher sales price.
912750_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Production and other taxes per BOE increased 50% primarily due to higher commodity prices compared to 2016, combined with regulatory changes in Oklahoma that increased tax rates for certain wells effective July 2017 and December 2017.
912750_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) per BOE decreased 6% primarily due to the impact of ceiling test impairments during the first half of 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	General and administrative expense (G A) decreased 5% , primarily due to reduction in workforce and restructuring charges recorded in 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	This decrease was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense due to accelerated recognition of expense related to changes made to our qualified retirement plan during 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	The following table presents information regarding G A expenses for our domestic operations:
912750_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	_________________ (1) Includes severance costs for workforce reductions, as well as office-lease abandonment and other organizational restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Denver, Houston and Tulsa offices into our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas.
912750_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	During 2017 , no ceiling test impairments were required.
912750_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	During 2016, we recorded ceiling test impairments of $962 million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Other operating expense decreased $15 million primarily due to the settlement of a lawsuit against the Company during the third quarter of 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	See Note 12 , "Commitments and Contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:
912750_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Lease operating expense per BOE increased 54% primarily due to lower lifting volumes and higher production handling fees per BOE, which increase as oil prices increase.
912750_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Total lease operating expense decreased 51% due to lower lifting volumes.
912750_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	DD A expense per BOE decreased 33% primarily due to a reduction of our DD A rate as a result of the ceiling test impairments during 2015 and the first half of 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	During 2017, no ceiling test impairments were required.
912750_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	During the first half of 2016, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments of $66 million .
912750_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following table presents information about our operating expenses:
912750_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , total operating expenses per BOE decreased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The primary reasons for the decrease follow:
912750_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Total LOE decreased 18% despite an 8% increase in total production due to our focus on cost-reduction initiatives in all basins.
912750_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	On a per BOE basis, LOE was 24% lower due to successful cost reduction efforts combined with our focused growth in the Anadarko Basin, which has lower operating costs than our other basins.
912750_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Transportation and processing expense per BOE increased 19% primarily due to an increase in NGL and natural gas volumes produced of 25% and 12%, respectively.
912750_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	in the Uinta Basin (see further discussion below in "Contractual Obligations") and higher utilization of pipelines to transport oil in the STACK play and Williston Basin, which allows us to transport oil to more favorable markets and thus receive a higher net price.
912750_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Production and other taxes decreased 15% per BOE year over year primarily due to our 2016 development activities occurring in areas with lower production tax rates.
912750_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	G A expenses for both years included capitalized direct internal costs and costs associated with workforce reductions and organizational restructuring.
912750_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Excluding these items that affect comparability, gross G A costs decreased 11% year over year, primarily due to cost savings initiatives including a more than 15% reduction of our workforce.
912750_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	The following table presents information regarding G A expenses for our domestic operations:
912750_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	_________________ (1) Includes severance costs for workforce reductions, as well as office-lease abandonment and other organizational restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our Denver, Houston and Tulsa offices into our headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas.
912750_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	(2) SVAP program decrease is associated with the decrease in the estimated fair value of the liability for our Stockholder Value Appreciation Program (SVAP), which ended December 31, 2015.
912750_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	During 2016 , we recorded ceiling test impairments of $962 million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The decrease primarily resulted from a 15% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 4% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since December 31, 2015 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	During 2015, we recorded ceiling test impairments of $4.8 billion due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	The decrease primarily resulted from a 47% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing and a 40% decrease in natural gas SEC pricing since December 31, 2014.
912750_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	These commodity price decreases were partially offset by the impact of current service cost reductions on our cash flow estimates.
912750_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Other operating expense increased $11 million primarily due to the settlement of a lawsuit against the Company during the third quarter of 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	See Note 12 , " Commitments and Contingencies ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The primary components within our operating expenses are as follows:
912750_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Lease operating expense remained flat year over year.
912750_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	DD A expense per BOE decreased 30% primarily due to a reduction of our DD A rate as a result of the ceiling test impairments during the first half of 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	During 2016, we recorded non-cash ceiling test impairments of $66 million due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The decrease primarily resulted from a 15% decrease in crude oil SEC pricing since December 31, 2015.
912750_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years ended December 31.
912750_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Interest expense associated with unproved oil and gas properties is capitalized into oil and gas properties.
912750_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Gross interest expense decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to $3 million of financing costs related to amending our revolving credit facility recognized in March 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Gross interest expense decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the April 2015 retirement of our $700 million aggregate principal of 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 using the proceeds from the lower interest rate $700 million 5 % Senior Notes due 2026 issued in March 2015.
912750_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	See Note 11 , " Debt ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Capitalized interest increased in 2017 over the previous two years due to a significant increase in the average amount of unproved oil and gas properties resulting from the acquisition of $398 million of unproved properties in June 2016.
912750_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The fluctuations in commodity derivative income (expense) from period to period are due to the volatility of commodity prices and changes in our outstanding derivative contracts during these periods.
912750_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	The amount of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives is the result of the change in the total fair value of our derivative positions from the prior year.
912750_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The $47 million loss recognized in "Commodity derivative income (expense)" in our 2017 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income is comprised of a $36 million realized gain and an $83 million unrealized loss.
912750_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The unrealized loss is primarily attributable to the increase in oil and NGL prices between periods.
912750_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	During 2017, forward curve prices increased 2.6% for oil and 21.8% for propane.
912750_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follow:
912750_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The $191 million loss recognized in "Commodity derivative income (expense)" in our 2016 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income is comprised of a $201 million realized gain and a $392 million unrealized loss.
912750_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The unrealized loss is primarily attributable to the increase in commodity prices between periods.
912750_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	Forward curve prices increased 21.6% for oil and 28.5% for natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	The components of the change in the fair value of our net derivative asset (liability) follow:
912750_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	On December 22, 2017, the United States (U.S.) enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law affecting the Company.
912750_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	We expect that these changes will positively impact future after-tax earnings in the U.S., primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate.
912750_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Set forth below is a discussion of certain provisions of the Tax Act and our assessment of the impact of such provisions on our results of operations, cash flows and consolidated financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Beginning January 1, 2018, our U.S. income will be taxed at the 21% federal corporate rate.
912750_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Further, we were required to recognize the effect of this rate change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017, the period the tax rate change was enacted.
912750_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset balance, therefore the rate change resulted in a non-cash decrease to the deferred tax asset and a corresponding and offsetting decrease in the valuation allowance balances of approximately $199 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Tax Act also repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) for tax years beginning January 1, 2018, and provides that existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in 2019.
912750_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	We had approximately $42 million of AMT credit carryovers at the end of 2017 that are expected to be fully refunded between 2019 and 2022.
912750_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	The valuation allowance related to this deferred tax asset was released and a noncurrent receivable was established, which resulted in a tax benefit of $42 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Further, the Tax Act modified the taxation of foreign earnings and the utilization of foreign tax credits (FTCs).
912750_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	As of December 31, 3017, we had $408 million of FTCs that have no value under the Tax Act which resulted in a non-cash reduction to the deferred tax asset and a corresponding and offsetting decrease in the valuation allowance.
912750_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Tax Act is a comprehensive bill containing several other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to materially affect us.
912750_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (11)% and (2)% , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Taxes for the year were impacted by our ability to monetize $19 million of the AMT credit carryover on the 2017 tax provision by an election to refund AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation.
912750_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	The Tax Act repealed the corporate AMT for tax years beginning January 1, 2018, and provides that any remaining AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in 2019.
912750_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	We had approximately $42 million of AMT credit carryovers at the end of 2017 that will be fully refunded between 2019 and 2022.
912750_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	The valuation allowance related to this deferred tax asset was released and a noncurrent receivable was established, which resulted in a tax benefit of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	Also, included in the net tax benefit for the year were refunds of $17 million related to the carryback of net operating losses to previously filed U.S. federal returns.
912750_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the change in valuation allowances, non-deductible expenses, state income taxes, the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates, and the impact of taxation of our China earnings in both the U.S and China.
912750_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Our future effective tax rates may also be impacted by additional ceiling test impairments or other items which generate deferred tax assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and/or reversal of such valuation allowances.
912750_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	moved from a deferred tax liability position to a deferred tax asset position in most taxing jurisdictions.
912750_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	We have recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.
912750_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	We continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support adjusting the reversal of these allowances.
912750_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.
912750_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.
912750_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	See the components of our income tax provision (benefit) below:
912750_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes " to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional disclosures.
912750_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year.
912750_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, as well as cash on hand and the available borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	We ended the year with $2.1 billion of liquidity consisting of a $1.8 billion undrawn credit facility and $326 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
912750_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	We expect to finance our 2018 capital budget with cash flows from operations, and cash on hand.
912750_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Should commodity prices significantly weaken, we may elect to curtail our investments to limit borrowings and preserve liquidity.
912750_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our 2018 capital budget, excluding estimated capitalized interest and direct internal costs of approximately $120 million , is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion , which reflects our current outlook for commodity prices in 2018.
912750_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results; oil, natural gas and NGL prices; industry conditions; the prices and availability of goods and services; and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold.
912750_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions is unpredictable.
912750_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	We believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances or fluctuations in our cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We continuously monitor our liquidity needs, coordinate our capital expenditure program with our expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluate our available alternative sources of liquidity, including accessing debt and equity capital markets in light of current and expected economic conditions.
912750_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	We believe that our liquidity position and ability to generate cash flows from our operations will be adequate to fund 2018 operations and continue to meet our other obligations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
912750_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
912750_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The amounts involved may be material.
912750_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Credit Arrangements and Other Financing Activities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	We have a revolving credit facility that matures in June 2020 and provides borrowing capacity of $1.8 billion .
912750_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	We also have money market lines of credit which, subject to compliance with restrictive covenants in our credit facility, have available borrowing capacity of $125 million at December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	At December 31, 2017 , we had no borrowings under our money market lines of credit or revolving credit facility and had no letters of credit outstanding.
912750_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	We have no scheduled maturities of senior notes until 2022.
912750_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior notes, see Note 11 , " Debt ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and the maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and certain non-cash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and ceiling test impairments) to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0.
912750_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	At December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and do not foresee this changing in 2018 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	As of February 15, 2018 , we had no borrowings under our money market lines of credit or revolving credit facility and had no letters of credit outstanding.
912750_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our working capital balance fluctuates primarily as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements, changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners.
912750_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	At December 31, 2017 , we had negative working capital of $72 million compared to positive working capital of $265 million at December 31, 2016 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our primary source of capital and liquidity is cash flows provided by operations, which are primarily affected by the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs sold, as well as commodity prices.
912750_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our net cash flows from operations were $952 million in 2017 , $826 million in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2015 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The primary drivers of higher operating cash flows in 2017 were higher revenues as a result of higher commodity prices and higher production, partially offset by lower realized derivative gains.
912750_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion , $1 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	divested our interest in the Bohai Bay field in China for approximately $32 million , including customary post-closing adjustments.
912750_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	For a more detailed description of the Bohai Bay divestiture, see Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	During 2016 , we reduced capital spending on oil and gas properties as compared to 2015 due to the economic environment for our industry, acquired additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for $476 million, subject to customary post-close adjustments and divested substantially all our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately $380 million .
912750_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(13) million , $715 million and $380 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	During 2016 , we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering for net proceeds of approximately $776 million .
912750_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	In April 2015 and May 2016, we announced plans to restructure our organization primarily in response to the commodity price environment and to improve margins, processes and cost efficiencies in operations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our restructuring activities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations due by year as of December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes assets and liabilities associated with our derivative contracts, which are dependent on the commodity price at the time of the contract settlement.
912750_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	For a discussion regarding our derivative contracts, see Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	(2) Includes agreements for office space, drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts.
912750_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The majority of these obligations relate to contracts for office space and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value.
912750_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Due to our various working interests where the drilling rig contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation.
912750_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be less than the gross obligation disclosed.
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have crude oil minimum volume delivery commitments that relate to our Uinta Basin production with two Salt Lake City, Utah refiners.
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	One delivery commitment is for approximately 15,000 barrels of oil per day through May 2020 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	The second commitment is for 16,000 barrels of oil per day through August 2025.
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we incur deficiency fees ranging from $3.50 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	During 2017, we incurred $29 million of Uinta Basin deficiency fees.
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S5	Based on forecasted production levels, we expect to incur $19 million in deficiency fees related to these delivery commitments in 2018 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S6	See Items 1 and 2 , " Business and Properties " for a description of our production and proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P78_S7	As of December 31, 2017 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements.
912750_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners.
912750_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Through the joint operating agreement, the non-operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator.
912750_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	These obligations are typically shared on a "working interest" basis.
912750_18_ITEM7_P79_S4	The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non-operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P79_S5	Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non-operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long-term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses.
912750_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	We use derivative contracts to manage the variability in cash flows caused by commodity price fluctuations associated with our anticipated oil, natural gas and NGL production.
912750_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.
912750_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	For a further discussion of our derivative activities, see " Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities " below and " Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices " in Item 7A of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	See the discussion and tables in Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," and Note 5 , " Fair Value Measurements ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Between January 1, 2018 and February 15, 2018 , we entered into additional derivative contracts as set forth below.
912750_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	A listing of our outstanding derivative contracts as of February 15, 2018 follows:
912750_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose.
912750_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
912750_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S3	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full description of the critical accounting policies and estimates below, as well as other accounting policies and estimates we make.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S4	Below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S5	We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.
912750_18_ITEM7_P86_S6	We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
912750_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Two generally accepted accounting methods are available for accounting for oil and gas producing activities successful efforts and full cost.
912750_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	The most significant differences between these methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying values of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment.
912750_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while these costs are capitalized under the full cost method.
912750_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	Both methods provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two-step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to assess for impairment.
912750_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	If required, the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward-looking prices.
912750_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	Impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the after-tax carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the after-tax net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using SEC pricing, costs in effect at year end and a 10% discount rate.
912750_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Proved Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our engineering estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including DD A expense and the full cost ceiling limitation.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	Proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are the estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on SEC pricing and under period-end economic and operating conditions.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S4	The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S5	Changes in commodity prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir will result in future revisions to our estimated proved reserves quantities.
912750_18_ITEM7_P90_S6	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
912750_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Under the full cost method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into country-based cost centers .
912750_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_18_ITEM7_P91_S2	Future development and abandonment costs are added, and unevaluated costs are withheld from the net costs capitalized in cost centers to represent a full cost pool, which is amortized and assessed for impairment.
912750_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Future development costs include expected costs to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment.
912750_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our gathering systems, production platforms and related structures, and restoration costs of land and seabed.
912750_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	We estimate these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and information from our engineering consultants.
912750_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimation is difficult and requires judgments that are subject to revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment.
912750_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs annually, or more frequently if circumstances change.
912750_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability and corresponding long-lived asset for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred.
912750_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	The liability is increased to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
912750_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD A expense.
912750_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD A expense.
912750_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	To change our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2017 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.12 per BOE, which would require a change in estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 3%, or $83 million.
912750_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our full cost pool until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	acreage, related seismic data and capitalized interest and direct internal costs are initially excluded from our full cost pool.
912750_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our full cost pool with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_18_ITEM7_P97_S2	Leasehold costs are transferred to our full cost pool to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_18_ITEM7_P97_S3	Currently, there are no unevaluated properties for our China business.
912750_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into our full cost pool involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage.
912750_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	At December 31, 2017 , we had a total of $1.2 billion of costs excluded from the respective full cost pools, all of which related to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	Inclusion of these costs in our domestic full cost pool, without adding any associated reserves, would have resulted in additional DD A expense.
912750_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	The full cost pool for each country is amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the cost center.
912750_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	Estimated proved reserves are a significant component of the calculation of DD A expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense.
912750_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense.
912750_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test impairment.
912750_18_ITEM7_P99_S4	To change our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2017 , our domestic DD A rate would need to change by $0.12 per BOE, which would require a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 2%, or 10 MMBOE.
912750_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of oil and gas property costs that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
912750_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	The ceiling value of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is calculated based on SEC pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter.
912750_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Once recorded, a ceiling test impairment is not reversible even if oil and gas prices increase.
912750_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	We do not anticipate a ceiling test impairment in either the U.S. or China in the first quarter of 2018 , as the current strip prices as of February 15, 2018 are above the current SEC pricing for oil and natural gas.
912750_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	It is difficult to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of expected future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating and development costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve additions and tax attributes.
912750_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	Subject to these numerous factors and inherent limitations, it is possible that we could experience additional ceiling test impairments in the future.
912750_18_ITEM7_P102_S3	See Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties Ceiling Test Impairments ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.
912750_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties.
912750_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and judgments, the accuracy of this allocation is inherently uncertain and could lead to materially different amounts allocated between proved and unproved oil and gas properties which would result in differences in recognizing depletion and amortization in future periods.
912750_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production.
912750_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	However, we do not designate any of our derivative contracts as accounting hedges.
912750_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	As our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis.
912750_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	We have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience non-cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility.
912750_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had a net derivative liability of $108 million , of which 74%, based on total contracted volumes, was measured based upon a modified Black-Scholes valuation model.
912750_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	The model considers various inputs including forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, counterparty credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_18_ITEM7_P106_S3	As a result, the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than their fair value as of December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	We periodically validate our valuations using independent third-party quotations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	For further discussion of our derivative instruments and activities, see " Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices ," in Item 7A of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	oil, gas and NGL derivative contracts, a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for equity and liability awards.
912750_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period.
912750_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our market-based restricted stock units.
912750_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.
912750_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	See Note 15 , " Stock-Based Compensation ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires significant judgment by management and is reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances.
912750_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	Changes in judgment regarding future realizability of deferred tax assets may result in the reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance.
912750_18_ITEM7_P115_S2	In the period that determination is made, our net income will benefit from a lower effective tax rate.
912750_18_ITEM7_P115_S3	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of income taxes.
912750_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of new accounting requirements.
912750_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Exploration, development, production and the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, tribal, local and international regulations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.
912750_18_ITEM7_P117_S3	See the discussion under the caption " We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business ," in Item 1A of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to enter into derivative contracts is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	While the use of derivative instruments may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In addition, the use of derivative contracts may involve basis risk.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	All of our derivative transactions have been carried out in the over-the-counter market.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	At December 31, 2017 , 10 of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 82% of our contracted volumes with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 12% .
912750_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , 30,260 MBbls of our expected 2018 and 2019 crude oil production were protected against price volatility using collars and fixed-price swaps, over 84% of which have associated sold puts.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The sold puts limit our downward price protection below the weighted average of our sold puts of $40.05 per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	If the market price remains below $40.05 per barrel, we receive the market price for our associated production plus the difference between our sold puts and the associated floors or fixed-price swaps, which averages $9.48 per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	For further discussion of our derivative activities, see Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," and Note 5 , " Fair Value Measurements ," to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal as 100% of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates at December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	A 10% increase in LIBOR would not impact our interest costs on debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 , but would decrease the fair value of our outstanding debt, as well as increase interest costs associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To the extent that business transactions in a foreign country are not denominated in the U.S. dollar, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.
912750_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	We did not have any open derivative contracts related to foreign currencies at December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
912750_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_18_ITEM8_P0_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
912750_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), the management of our Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that follows.
912750_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
912750_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
912750_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
912750_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
912750_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
912750_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
912750_18_ITEM8_P7_S2	( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
912750_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
912750_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
912750_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
912750_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P9_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
912750_18_ITEM8_P9_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
912750_18_ITEM8_P9_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
912750_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
912750_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1993.
912750_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.
912750_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).
912750_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Our U.S. operations are onshore and focus primarily on large scale, liquids-rich resource plays in the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of Oklahoma, the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Uinta Basin of Utah.
912750_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	In addition, we have oil assets offshore China.
912750_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
912750_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	We proportionately consolidate our interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production joint ventures and partnerships in accordance with industry practice.
912750_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
912750_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to "Newfield," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" are to Newfield Exploration Company and its subsidiaries.
912750_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	As an independent oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
912750_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Historically, the energy markets have been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.
912750_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that we can economically produce.
912750_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Other risks and uncertainties that could affect us in a volatile commodity price environment include, but are not limited to, counterparty credit risk for our receivables, responsibility for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own, inability to access credit markets, regulatory risks and our ability to meet financial ratios and covenants in our financing agreements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period; and the quantities and values of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves used in calculating depletion and assessing impairment of our oil and gas properties.
912750_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
912750_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	Our most significant estimates are associated with the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the timing and amount of transfers of our unevaluated properties into our amortizable full cost pool, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the fair value of our derivative contracts.
912750_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Restructuring costs include severance and related benefit costs, costs associated with abandoned office space, employee relocation costs and other associated costs.
912750_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Employee severance and related benefit costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period, if any.
912750_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Employee relocation costs are expensed as incurred.
912750_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	On the date a leased property ceases to be used, a liability for non-cancellable office-lease costs associated with restructuring is recognized and measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Fair value estimates include assumptions regarding estimated future sublease payments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	These estimates could materially differ from actual results and may require revision to initial estimates of the liability.
912750_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	See Note 17 , " Restructuring Costs ," for additional disclosures.
912750_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	All of our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold at market-based prices adjusted for location and quality differentials to a variety of purchasers.
912750_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	We record revenue when we deliver our production to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
912750_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Revenues from the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs on properties in which we have joint ownership are recorded under the sales method.
912750_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Under the sales method, the Company and other joint owners may sell more or less than their entitled share of production.
912750_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	Should the Company s excess sales exceed our share of estimated remaining recoverable reserves, a liability is recorded.
912750_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The functional currency for our China operations is the U.S. dollar.
912750_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Gains and losses incurred on transactions in a currency other than the U.S. dollar are recorded under the caption "Other income (expense) Other, net" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	We invest cash in excess of near-term capital and operating requirements in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar time deposits and money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
912750_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Restricted cash consists of amounts held in escrow accounts to satisfy future plug and abandonment obligations for our China operations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	These amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released as we plug and abandon wells and facilities in China.
912750_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Consistent with our other plug and abandonment activities, changes in restricted cash are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Long-term investments consist of debt and equity securities, a majority of which are classified as "available-for-sale" and stated at fair value.
912750_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses and the related deferred income tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.
912750_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	The portion of accumulated other comprehensive income within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity related to investments was $3 million at December 31, 2017 and $1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
912750_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the securities sold.
912750_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	We regularly assess our investments for impairment and consider any impairment to be other than temporary if we intend to sell the security, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security, or we do not expect to recover our cost of the security.
912750_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	We routinely assess material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability.
912750_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Many of our receivables are from joint interest owners of properties we operate.
912750_18_ITEM8_P33_S2	Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of related joint interest billings.
912750_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Generally, our oil and gas receivables are collected within 45 to 60 days of production.
912750_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected.
912750_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Other current assets primarily consist of federal income tax refunds receivable, capital and lease operating expense prepayments and other prepaid items, including but not limited to, rent and insurance.
912750_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , federal income tax refunds receivable were $53 million and $24 million , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	See Note 8, " Income Taxes ," for further discussion.
912750_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Inventories primarily consist of tubular goods and well equipment held for use in our oil and natural gas operations and oil produced but not sold in our China operations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
912750_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in China is produced into floating storage facilities and sold periodically as barge quantities accumulate.
912750_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The carrying value of oil inventory is the sum of related production costs and depletion expense.
912750_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	See Note 3 , " Inventories ," for further discussion.
912750_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities.
912750_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including salaries, benefits, interest and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized into country-based cost centers.
912750_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the costs in the applicable cost center unless the reduction would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
912750_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Capitalized costs and estimated future development costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on proved reserves associated with the applicable cost center.
912750_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.
912750_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	A particular cost center ceiling is equal to the sum of:
912750_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	If net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test impairment to the extent of such excess.
912750_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	If required, a ceiling test impairment reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and, holding other factors constant, results in lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in future periods.
912750_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The risk that we will be required to impair the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil, natural gas and NGL prices decrease significantly for a prolonged period, or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our full cost pool until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated.
912750_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage, related seismic data and capitalized interest and direct internal costs are initially excluded from our full cost pool.
912750_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Leasehold costs are either transferred to our full cost pool with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value.
912750_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Leasehold costs are transferred to our full cost pool to the extent a reduction in value has occurred, or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established.
912750_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	See Note 6 , " Oil and Gas Properties ," for a detailed discussion regarding our oil and gas property and our asset acquisitions and sales transactions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years.
912750_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Gathering systems and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 25 years.
912750_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	If a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities or plug and abandon wells can be made, we record a liability (an asset retirement obligation or ARO) on our consolidated balance sheet and capitalize the present value of the asset retirement cost in oil and gas properties in the period in which the ARO is incurred.
912750_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Settlements include payments made to satisfy the AROs, as well as transfer of the AROs to purchasers of our divested properties.
912750_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	In general, the amount of the initial recorded ARO and the costs capitalized will equal the estimated future costs to satisfy the abandonment obligation assuming normal operation of the asset, using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor up to the estimated settlement date, which is then discounted back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using the credit adjusted risk-free rate for our Company.
912750_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value and the original capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis within the related full cost pool.
912750_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	Both the accretion and depreciation are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	See Note 10 , " Asset Retirement Obligations ," for further discussion.
912750_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, liabilities and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
912750_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	We accrue for losses when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
912750_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	See Note 12 , " Commitments and Contingencies ," for a more detailed discussion regarding our contingencies.
912750_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed as incurred.
912750_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based upon evaluations of currently available facts related to each site.
912750_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
912750_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be generated to utilize deferred tax assets.
912750_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
912750_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	We also evaluate potential uncertain tax positions, and if necessary, establish accruals for such items.
912750_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes ," for further discussion.
912750_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	We apply a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for equity and liability awards.
912750_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	For equity awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the applicable service period.
912750_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The fair value of our service based restricted stock and restricted stock units are based on the Company's stock price on the date of grant.
912750_18_ITEM8_P52_S3	We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our market-based restricted stock units.
912750_18_ITEM8_P52_S4	We also have cash-settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method, which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the Company's stock price at the end of each period.
912750_18_ITEM8_P52_S5	See Note 15 , " Stock-Based Compensation ," for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
912750_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties.
912750_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	As the operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the property and seek reimbursement from the other joint interest owners in the property for their share of those costs.
912750_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	In addition, when warranted, we require prepayments from our joint interest owners for drilling and completion projects.
912750_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	Our joint interest owners consist primarily of independent oil and gas producers whose ability to reimburse us could be negatively impacted by adverse market conditions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	The purchasers of our oil, gas and NGL production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and gas companies, refiners and gas pipeline companies.
912750_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	We perform credit evaluations of the purchasers of our production and monitor their financial condition on an ongoing basis.
912750_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	Based on our evaluations and monitoring, we obtain cash escrows, letters of credit or parental guarantees from some purchasers.
912750_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	All of our derivative transactions were carried out in the over-the-counter market and are not typically subject to margin-deposit requirements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	We monitor the credit ratings of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis and have netting arrangements that provide for offsetting payables against receivables by counterparty.
912750_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	Although we have entered into derivative contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price volatility.
912750_18_ITEM8_P55_S3	In addition, in poor economic environments and tight financial markets, the risk of a counterparty default is heightened and fewer counterparties may participate in derivative transactions, which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes.
912750_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables by counterparty.
912750_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	At December 31, 2017 , 10 of our 15 counterparties accounted for approximately 82% of our contracted volumes, with the largest counterparty accounting for approximately 12% .
912750_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	At December 31, 2017 , approximately 79% of our volumes subject to derivative instruments are with lenders under our credit facility.
912750_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	Our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative instruments contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	During 2016 , China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd. accounted for 12% of our total revenues.
912750_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	During 2015 , China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd., MidCon Gathering LLC and Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations GP LLC accounted for 13% , 11% and 10% , respectively, of our total revenues.
912750_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	We believe that the loss of a major customer would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are available.
912750_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Our derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.
912750_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	While we utilize our derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil, gas and NGL production, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as accounting hedges under the accounting guidance.
912750_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	The related cash flow impact of our derivative activities is reflected as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives are determined to have a significant financing element at inception, in which case they are classified within financing activities.
912750_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	See Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," for a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities.
912750_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet accordingly.
912750_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	See Note 4 , " Derivative Financial Instruments ," for details regarding the gross amounts, as well as the impact of our netting arrangements on our net derivative position.
912750_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance regarding the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.
912750_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and may be applied retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit).
912750_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	We will adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings (deficit).
912750_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	We have completed the process of evaluating our current revenue recognition policies to the new requirements for each of our revenue categories and have not identified any material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
912750_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows.
912750_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explains the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents using a retrospective approach.
912750_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM8_P64_S3	Adoption of this standard will impact our cash flow from operations in periods with changes in restricted cash.
912750_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding several broad topics related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
912750_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for leases.
912750_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	The guidance requires recognition of most leases on the balance sheet.
912750_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	The guidance requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.
912750_18_ITEM8_P66_S3	The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
912750_18_ITEM8_P66_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	Reserve for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes an allowance for $15 million related to the sale of our Malaysia operations in 2014.
912750_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	See Note 12, " Commitments and Contingencies " to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional details regarding our Malaysia litigation.
912750_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we had inventory writedowns of $2 million , $1 million and $5 million , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	These writedowns are included in "Operating expenses Other" on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
912750_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	At December 31, 2017 , we had no crude oil inventory in China due to the shut-in of production in our Pearl field and the lifting of remaining barrels in August 2017.
912750_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the crude oil inventory from our China operations consisted of approximately 11,500 barrels.
912750_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	We utilize derivative strategies that consist of either a single derivative instrument or a combination of instruments to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future domestic oil, natural gas, and NGL production.
912750_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	While the use of derivative instruments may limit or partially reduce the downside risk of adverse commodity price movements, their use also may limit future income from favorable commodity price movements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	With respect to a swap position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap strike price, and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap strike price.
912750_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	A swap with a sold put position consists of a standard swap position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the associated fixed-price swap.
912750_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	This structure enables us to increase the fixed-price swap with the value received through the sale of the put.
912750_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the put strike price, then we will only receive the difference between the swap price and the put strike price.
912750_18_ITEM8_P73_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard swap only.
912750_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	A swaption is an option to exercise a swap where the buyer (counterparty) of the swaption purchases the right from the seller (Newfield), but not the obligation, to enter into a fixed-price swap with the seller on a predetermined date (expiration date).
912750_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The swap price is a fixed price determined at the time of the swaption contract.
912750_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	If the swaption is exercised, the contract will become a swap treated consistent with our other fixed-price swaps.
912750_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	Collars (combination of purchased put options (floor) and sold call options (ceiling)) .
912750_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	For a collar position, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor strike price while we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling strike price.
912750_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	Neither party is required to make a payment to the other party if the settlement price for any settlement period is equal to or greater than the floor strike price and equal to or less than the ceiling strike price.
912750_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	A collar with a sold put position consists of a standard collar position plus a put sold by us with a strike price below the floor strike price of the collar.
912750_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	This structure enables us to improve the collar strike prices with the value received through the sale of the additional put.
912750_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	If the settlement price for any settlement period falls equal to or below the additional put strike price, then we will receive the difference between the floor strike price and the additional put strike price.
912750_18_ITEM8_P76_S3	If the settlement price is greater than the additional put strike price, the result is the same as it would have been with a standard collar only.
912750_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	While we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes, periodically, we may restructure our derivative positions by purchasing, selling or unwinding certain derivative instruments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The detailed outstanding derivative position tables below represent our net positions after considering the impacts of any applicable restructuring.
912750_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Our oil and gas derivative contracts are settled based upon reported prices on the NYMEX, and our NGLs are settled on posted prices at Mont Belvieu.
912750_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	The estimated fair value of these contracts is based upon various factors, including future prices, over-the-counter quotations, estimated volatility, non-performance risk adjustments using counterparty rates of default and time to maturity.
912750_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The calculation of the fair value of options requires the use of an option-pricing model.
912750_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	At December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding derivative positions as set forth in the tables below.
912750_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	_________________ (1) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold crude oil swaption contracts that, if exercised on their expiration date in the first quarter of 2018, would protect 273,000 Bbls of second quarter 2018 production from future commodity price volatility.
912750_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	These contracts give the counterparties the option to enter into swap contracts with us at $59.00 /bbl for second quarter 2018.
912750_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	(2) For the fixed-price swaps with sold puts, if the market price remains below our sold puts at contract settlement, we will receive the market price plus the difference between our swaps and our sold puts.
912750_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	We had derivative financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as assets (liabilities) at their respective estimated fair value, as set forth below.
912750_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	The amount of gain (loss) recognized in "Commodity derivative income (expense)" in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income related to our derivative financial instruments follows:
912750_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
912750_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	The authoritative guidance requires disclosure of the framework for measuring fair value and requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
912750_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
912750_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
912750_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
912750_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market data.
912750_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
912750_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity fixed-price swaps and, as of the third quarter of 2017, commodity options (i.e. price collars, sold puts, purchased calls or swaptions).
912750_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	We use a modified Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model for option and swaption derivative contracts that considers various inputs including: (a) forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
912750_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
912750_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
912750_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	We continue to evaluate our inputs to ensure the fair value level classification is appropriate.
912750_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	When transfers between levels occur, it is our policy to assume that the transfer occurred at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
912750_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	The determination of the fair values of our derivative contracts incorporates various factors, which include not only the impact of our non-performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved.
912750_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	We utilize counterparty rate of default values to assess the impact of non-performance risk when evaluating receivables from counterparties and our credit rate when evaluating liabilities.
912750_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following table summarizes the valuation of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
912750_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the indicated periods.
912750_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	_________________ (1) During the second quarter of 2016, we transferred $46 million of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 category as a result of our Level 3 swaptions being exercised by the counterparties as swaps in June 2016.
912750_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	(2) During the third quarter of 2017, we transferred $62 million of derivative option contracts out of the Level 3 hierarchy into Level 2 hierarchy as a result of our ability to derive volatility inputs from directly observable sources.
912750_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The estimated fair value of our notes, based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) as of December 31, was as follows:
912750_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	Any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit as of the indicated dates are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
912750_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	At December 31, oil and gas properties consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	We capitalized approximately $124 million , $121 million and $107 million of interest and direct internal costs in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Costs withheld from amortization as of December 31, 2017 consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Ceiling Test Impairments Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of oil and gas property costs that can be capitalized on our balance sheet.
912750_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	At December 31, 2017 , the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon SEC pricing of $51.34 per barrel for oil and $2.98 per MMBtu for natural gas.
912750_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	Using these prices, our ceiling values exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties for the U.S. and China, respectively, and no ceiling test impairment was required in 2017.
912750_18_ITEM8_P102_S3	Future declines in SEC pricing or downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves could result in additional ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in subsequent periods.
912750_18_ITEM8_P102_S4	Ceiling test impairments during 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	_________________ (1) Starting in the first quarter of 2016, there was no tax impact due to a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
912750_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	See Note 8 , " Income Taxes ," for additional information regarding the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
912750_18_ITEM8_P103_S2	(2) Excludes domestic rig impairment of $4 million .
912750_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	In May 2017, we closed our previously disclosed sale transaction with certain of our joint venture partners to divest our interest in the Bohai Bay field in China for approximately $32 million , including customary post-close adjustments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	Upon completion of our assessment, the sale of our Bohai Bay assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves for our China full cost pool and, as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our China full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Bohai Bay operations through the date of sale.
912750_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	Texas Asset Sale In September 2016, we closed the sale of substantially all of our oil and gas assets in Texas for approximately $380 million , subject to customary post-close adjustments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	The sale of our Texas assets did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves for our U.S. cost pool, and as such, all proceeds were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized.
912750_18_ITEM8_P105_S2	These consolidated financial statements include the results of our Texas operations through the date of sale.
912750_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	Anadarko Basin Acquisition In June 2016, we acquired additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play for an adjusted cash purchase price of $476 million , subject to customary post-close adjustments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	We also assumed asset retirement obligations of $8 million .
912750_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	We allocated $398 million to unproved properties and wells in progress and $86 million to proved oil and gas properties.
912750_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we acquired various other oil and gas properties for approximately $100 million , $7 million and $125 million , respectively, and sold certain other oil and gas properties for proceeds of approximately $72 million , $39 million and $90 million , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	The related cash flows and results of operations for these divested assets are included in our consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.
912750_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	All of the proceeds associated with our asset sales were recorded as adjustments to our domestic full cost pool.
912750_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	At December 31, other property and equipment consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	During 2017, we sold $11 million of furniture, fixtures and equipment and removed the associated asset and accumulated depreciation accordingly.
912750_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	For the years ended December 31, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	For the years ended December 31, the total provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	Taxes for the year were impacted by our ability to monetize $19 million of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryover on the 2017 U.S federal tax provision by an election to refund AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation.
912750_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	The newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) repealed the corporate AMT for tax years beginning January 1, 2018, and provides that any remaining AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in 2019.
912750_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	We had approximately $42 million of AMT credit carryovers at the end of 2017 that will be fully refunded between 2019 and 2022.
912750_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	The valuation allowance related to this deferred tax asset was released and a noncurrent receivable was established, which resulted in a tax benefit of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM8_P112_S4	Also included in the net tax benefit for the year were refunds of $17 million related to the carryback of net operating losses to previously filed U.S. federal returns.
912750_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	The provision for state deferred income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to Oklahoma state deferred tax expense.
912750_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	Other state taxing jurisdictions were in a net deferred tax asset position for which a corresponding valuation allowance was recorded resulting in zero deferred tax benefit for those jurisdictions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	Our effective tax rate for 2017 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to domestic and international deferred tax asset valuation allowances discussed below.
912750_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	The amount for state income taxes in the rate reconciliation table below is the net deferred tax expenses before valuation allowances, if any, generated from all states.
912750_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	This table presents a reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate.
912750_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively, the components of our deferred tax asset (liability) were as follows:
912750_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	_________________ (1) The December 31, 2017 deferred tax asset (liability) has been adjusted for the lower federal statutory rate under the Tax Act.
912750_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	At December 31, 2017 we have a net deferred tax liability in Oklahoma of $76 million .
912750_18_ITEM8_P117_S2	All other taxing jurisdictions are in a net deferred tax asset position, for which we recorded an offsetting full valuation allowance, as prescribed by the accounting standards.
912750_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	Beginning January 1, 2018, our U.S. income will be taxed at a 21 percent federal corporate rate under the Tax Act.
912750_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	We were required to recognize the effect of this rate change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017, the period the tax rate change was enacted.
912750_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	We maintain a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset balance, therefore the rate change resulted in a non-cash decrease to the deferred tax asset and a corresponding and offsetting decrease in the valuation allowance balances of approximately $199 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had gross net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1.75 billion and $849 million , respectively, for federal income tax and $1.5 billion for state income tax purposes, which may be used in future years to offset taxable income.
912750_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	To the extent not utilized, the federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years 2019 through 2037.
912750_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had foreign tax credits of approximately $0 million and $593 million , respectively, which would have expired during the years 2022 through 2026.
912750_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	During 2017, we filed amended returns to deduct $185 million of the foreign taxes paid, thereby converting the credit to a net operating loss carryforward.
912750_18_ITEM8_P120_S2	We are unable to utilize the remaining $408 million under the Tax Act and therefore, removed the deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation allowance.
912750_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	Utilization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions within the carryforward period.
912750_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and NGL prices; estimates of the timing and amount of future production; and estimates of future operating and capital costs.
912750_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	Therefore, no certainty exists that we will be able to fully utilize our existing deferred tax assets.
912750_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The change in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows at December 31:
912750_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	Due to the ceiling test impairments of our oil and gas properties in prior periods, we moved from a deferred tax liability position to a deferred tax asset position in most taxing jurisdictions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	We consider it more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized and therefore, we recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $362 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	The net change in the U.S. federal and state valuation allowance for 2017 of $343 million included a decrease of $199 million for the corporate tax rate reduction under the Tax Act.
912750_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	The net change in the U.S. federal and state valuation allowance for 2016 of $466 million included an increase of $37 million for the early adoption of the simplification of employee share-based payment transactions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P124_S4	The net change in the foreign tax credit valuation allowance for 2017 of $593 million included a decrease of $185 million for the conversion of the credit to a net operating loss and a decrease of $408 million for the permanent loss of the foreign tax credit under the Tax Act.
912750_18_ITEM8_P124_S5	We recorded a full valuation allowance on our China deferred tax assets of $37 million and $42 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we did not have a liability for uncertain tax positions, and as such, we did not accrue related interest or penalties.
912750_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	The tax years 2013 through 2016 remain open to examination for federal income tax purposes and by the other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
912750_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:
912750_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The change in our ARO for each of the three years ended December 31, is set forth below:
912750_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	_________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2016 , additions include $8 million of abandonment obligations assumed through our Anadarko Basin acquisition.
912750_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	(2) Revisions are primarily due to changes in cost estimates and timing of expected abandonment.
912750_18_ITEM8_P128_S2	(3) For the year ended December 31, 2017 , settlements include $7 million related to the sale of our interest in the Bohai Bay field in China.
912750_18_ITEM8_P128_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , settlements include $35 million related to the sale of our Texas assets.
912750_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	At December 31, our debt consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had no borrowings under our money market lines of credit or revolving credit facility and had no letters of credit outstanding.
912750_18_ITEM8_P130_S1	We have a revolving credit facility that matures in June 2020 and provides borrowing capacity of $1.8 billion .
912750_18_ITEM8_P130_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the largest individual loan commitment by any lender was 12% of total commitments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	Subject to compliance with restrictive covenants in our credit facility, our available borrowing capacity (before any amounts drawn) under our money market lines of credit with various institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of those financial institutions, was $125 million at December 31, 2017 .
912750_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, equal to (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (100 basis points per annum at December 31, 2017 ) or (b) the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (200 basis points per annum at December 31, 2017 ).
912750_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	Under our credit facility, we pay commitment fees on available but undrawn amounts based on a grid of our debt rating (37.5 basis points per annum at December 31, 2017 ).
912750_18_ITEM8_P133_S1	We incurred aggregate commitment fees under our credit facility of approximately $7 million , $7 million and $5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which were recorded in Interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
912750_18_ITEM8_P133_S2	We incurred approximately $3 million of financing costs related to amending our revolving credit facility in March 2016, which were also included in "Interest expense" on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
912750_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	Our credit facility has restrictive financial covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and the maintenance of a ratio of earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes and certain non-cash items (such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and ceiling test impairments) to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0.
912750_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	At December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
912750_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee of 20 basis points and annual fees based on a grid of our debt rating (200 basis points at December 31, 2017 ).
912750_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	The credit facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect when made; a change of control; or certain other material adverse changes in our business.
912750_18_ITEM8_P136_S1	Our senior notes also contain standard events of default.
912750_18_ITEM8_P136_S2	If any of the foregoing defaults were to occur, our lenders under the credit facility could terminate future lending commitments, and our lenders under both the credit facility and our notes could declare the outstanding borrowings due and payable.
912750_18_ITEM8_P136_S3	In addition, our credit facility, senior notes and substantially all of our derivative arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P136_S4	See Note 1 , " Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Concentration of Credit Risk ," for additional details.
912750_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.
912750_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P137_S2	We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
912750_18_ITEM8_P137_S3	The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P137_S4	The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.
912750_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	We have various commitments for firm transportation, operating lease agreements for office space and other agreements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P138_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , future minimum payments under these non-cancelable agreements are as follows:
912750_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	Firm transportation is comprised of various agreements with third parties for oil and gas gathering and transportation.
912750_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	Rent expense with respect to our lease commitments for office space for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $16 million , $21 million and $35 million , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	Our other agreements are primarily other equipment leases.
912750_18_ITEM8_P140_S1	Payments under our drilling-related contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and will be less than the gross obligation disclosed in wells in which we do not own a 100% working interest.
912750_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	Not included in the table above are crude oil minimum volume delivery commitments that relate to our Uinta Basin production with two Salt Lake City, Utah refiners.
912750_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	One delivery commitment is for approximately 15,000 barrels of oil per day through May 2020.
912750_18_ITEM8_P141_S2	The second commitment is for 16,000 barrels of oil per day through August 2025.
912750_18_ITEM8_P141_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , our delivery commitments through 2025 were as follows:
912750_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	Given the volatility in oil and natural gas prices and the related impact on our 2018 planned capital investments, as well as the potential impact on development plans in future years, we could fail to deliver the minimum production required under these commitments.
912750_18_ITEM8_P142_S1	In the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments, we would incur deficiency fees ranging from $3.50 to $6.50 per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM8_P142_S2	During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we incurred $29 million , $16 million , and $0 million , of Uinta Basin deficiency fees.
912750_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	On October 19, 2017, we received notice of a request for arbitration from SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad (SapuraKencana), the purchaser of our Malaysian business in February 2014.
912750_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	SapuraKencana is asserting that the Company owes approximately $89 million in damages for breach of contract and for a tax indemnity, plus interest and legal and other costs.
912750_18_ITEM8_P143_S2	We filed our response to the request for arbitration in December 2017.
912750_18_ITEM8_P143_S3	We continue to be committed to fully contesting the claims and intend to vigorously defend the Company's interest.
912750_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	In May 2015, a lawsuit was filed against the Company alleging certain plugging and abandonment predecessor-in-interest liabilities related to offshore assets sold by the Company in 2010.
912750_18_ITEM8_P144_S1	The Company responded to the petition, denied the allegations and vigorously defended the case.
912750_18_ITEM8_P144_S2	The court held that the Company must bear a "portion" of the plugging and abandonment costs, but the "exact percentage" of such costs should be determined in arbitration and stayed the case pending arbitration.
912750_18_ITEM8_P144_S3	Through settlement negotiations surrounding the arbitration proceeding, the Company and the plaintiff reached a mutual settlement on September 23, 2016 involving a cash payment by the Company totaling $18 million .
912750_18_ITEM8_P144_S4	The settlement was recorded under the caption "Operating expenses Other" on our consolidated statement of operations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P144_S5	On October 3, 2016, the court dismissed the case with prejudice.
912750_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes, all arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as (a) claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments, (b) commercial disputes, (c) personal injury claims and (d) property damage claims.
912750_18_ITEM8_P145_S1	Although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
912750_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	During the first quarter of 2016, we issued 34.5 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering for net proceeds of approximately $776 million .
912750_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	A portion of the proceeds was used to acquire additional properties in the Anadarko Basin STACK play and to repay borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit.
912750_18_ITEM8_P146_S2	The remainder was available for general corporate purposes.
912750_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, we issued 25.3 million additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering.
912750_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	We received net proceeds of approximately $815 million , which were used primarily to repay all borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit that were outstanding at that time.
912750_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	Upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we typically repurchase a portion of the vested shares for payment of employee tax withholding.
912750_18_ITEM8_P148_S1	Such repurchases are not part of a publicly announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock.
912750_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income less any applicable adjustments (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock (excluding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period (the denominator).
912750_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	Diluted EPS incorporates the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (using the treasury stock method).
912750_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units and the amount of excess tax benefits that would be recorded when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
912750_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	The following is the calculation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding and EPS for the indicated years.
912750_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	For the years ended December 31, our stock-based compensation expense consisted of the following:
912750_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $54 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation awards that vest within four years .
912750_18_ITEM8_P153_S1	On December 31, 2017 , the last reported sales price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $31.53 per share.
912750_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	During the first quarter of 2017 , we changed our qualified retirement requirements for existing market-based restricted stock units and all subsequently issued equity and liability awards.
912750_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	An employee becomes eligible for qualified retirement based on a combination of years of service and age.
912750_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	Under the revised requirements, qualified retirement allows an employee to continue vesting between 50% and 100% of awards with no additional service requirement beyond a six-month notification period.
912750_18_ITEM8_P155_S2	This change resulted in the accelerated recognition of stock-based compensation expense for unvested market-based restricted stock units previously issued and all subsequently issued equity and liability awards.
912750_18_ITEM8_P156_S0	Equity awards consist of service-based and market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options and stock purchase options under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
912750_18_ITEM8_P156_S1	In May 2017, Newfield adopted the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (2017 Plan), which replaced the 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan as the vehicle for granting equity-based compensation awards.
912750_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	The fair value of grants is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock options and a Monte Carlo lattice-based model for our market-based restricted stock and restricted stock units.
912750_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	Compensation expense for equity awards is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service periods.
912750_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	Shares available for grant under our 2017 Plan are reduced by 1.67 times the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units awarded under the plan and are reduced by 1 times the number of shares subject to stock options awarded under the plan.
912750_18_ITEM8_P159_S1	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately (1) 9.5 million shares available for issuance under our 2017 Plan if all future awards are stock options, or (2) 5.7 million shares available for issuance under our 2017 Plan if all future awards are restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_18_ITEM8_P159_S2	Thus far, all awards under our 2017 Plan have been granted as restricted stock or restricted stock units.
912750_18_ITEM8_P159_S3	We issue common shares on the grant date for restricted stock and on the exercise or vesting date for options and restricted stock units.
912750_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.
912750_18_ITEM8_P160_S1	At December 31, 2017 , approximately 2.0 million shares of non-vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units were outstanding.
912750_18_ITEM8_P160_S2	These shares primarily vest over one to four years and vesting is dependent upon the recipient meeting applicable service requirements.
912750_18_ITEM8_P160_S3	In addition, at December 31, 2017 , our employees held approximately 0.7 million shares of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting criteria (all of which are currently considered market-based restricted stock under authoritative accounting guidance).
912750_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	The following table summarizes the activity for our restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity.
912750_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	The total fair value of all restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $35 million , $39 million and $35 million , respectively.
912750_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	Options generally expire ten years from the grant date and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year.
912750_18_ITEM8_P163_S1	The exercise price of options cannot be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the grant date.
912750_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	We issue new shares of stock when stock options are exercised.
912750_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	No stock options have been granted since 2008, except for ESPP options as discussed in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan section below.

912750_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
912750_18_ITEM8_P195_S1	The data for a given reservoir also may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
912750_18_ITEM8_P195_S2	Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.
912750_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management.
912750_18_ITEM8_P196_S1	The preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures, which include verification of data input into our reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews.

912750_18_ITEM8_P197_S1	Our petroleum engineering staff review estimates annually with management and revise the estimates, either upward or downward, as warranted by available data.
912750_18_ITEM8_P197_S2	The data reviewed includes, among other things, seismic data, well logs, production tests, reservoir pressures and individual well and field performance data.
912750_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	isopach maps, individual well and field performance and other engineering and geological work products such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field projections.
912750_18_ITEM8_P198_S1	Additionally, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices factor into estimating quantities of reserves.
912750_18_ITEM8_P198_S2	Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental regulations, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with development drilling.
912750_18_ITEM8_P198_S3	Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner.

912750_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	At the request of Newfield Exploration Company (Newfield), Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has conducted a reserves audit of the estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 prepared by Newfield s engineering and geological staff based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations).
912750_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	Our reserves audit, completed on January 12, 2018 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Newfield in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P26_S2	The estimated reserves shown herein represent Newfield s estimated net reserves attributable to the leasehold and royalty interests and derived through certain production sharing contracts in certain properties owned by Newfield and the portion of those reserves reviewed by Ryder Scott, as of December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM15_P26_S3	The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott incorporate Newfield s reserve determinations and are located in the states of Montana, North Dakota, and Utah (Western Region); and offshore in the South China Sea (International Region).
912750_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	The properties reviewed by Ryder Scott account for a portion of Newfield s total net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	Based on the estimates of total net proved reserves prepared by Newfield for the Western and International Regions, the reserves audit conducted by Ryder Scott addresses 40 percent of the total proved developed net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, 9 percent of the total proved developed net gas reserves, 17 percent of the total proved undeveloped net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, and 7 percent of the total proved undeveloped net gas reserves of Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P27_S2	On a barrel of oil equivalency basis, where 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas equal one barrel of oil equivalent, the properties reviewed by Ryder Scott represent 21 percent of the total proved reserves of Newfield, or on a regional basis, 98 percent of Newfield s Western Region total net proved reserves and 100 percent of Newfield s International Region total net proved reserves.
912750_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	As prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (SPE auditing standards), a reserves audit is defined as the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or Reserves Information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of the methodologies employed; (2) the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon; (3) the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process; (4) the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used; and (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities and/or Reserves Information.
912750_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Reserves Information may consist of various estimates pertaining to the extent and value of petroleum properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Newfield, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Newfield in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Newfield are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards.
912750_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	In calculating whether the net remaining reserves were within tolerance, an equivalent unit basis was used wherein natural gas was converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	The estimated reserves presented in this report are related to hydrocarbon prices.
912750_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	Newfield has informed us that in the preparation of their reserve and income projections, as of December 31, 2017, they used average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P32_S2	Actual future prices may vary significantly from the prices required by SEC regulations; therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report.
912750_18_ITEM15_P32_S3	The net reserves as estimated by Newfield attributable to Newfield's interest in properties that we reviewed and for those that we did not review are summarized below:
912750_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in standard 42 gallon barrels and shown herein as thousands of barrels (MBBLS).
912750_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	All gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.
912750_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
912750_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled Petroleum Reserves Definitions is included as an attachment to this report.
912750_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	The various proved reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled Petroleum Reserves Status Definitions and Guidelines in this report.
912750_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in category.
912750_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P36_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
912750_18_ITEM15_P36_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
912750_18_ITEM15_P36_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
912750_18_ITEM15_P36_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
912750_18_ITEM15_P36_S5	At Newfield s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties reviewed herein.
912750_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward.
912750_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods.
912750_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.
912750_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	Proved reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
912750_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
912750_18_ITEM15_P40_S1	Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks.
912750_18_ITEM15_P40_S2	Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
912750_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P41_S1	The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a).
912750_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy.
912750_18_ITEM15_P42_S1	These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves.
912750_18_ITEM15_P42_S2	Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
912750_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
912750_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves.
912750_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category assigned by the evaluator.
912750_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable and/or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.
912750_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely than not to be achieved.
912750_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
912750_18_ITEM15_P45_S2	The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
912750_18_ITEM15_P45_S3	All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
912750_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available.
912750_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein.
912750_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	The proved reserves, prepared by Newfield, for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a combination of methods.
912750_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	All of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods or analogy.
912750_18_ITEM15_P47_S2	These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data ending over a range from August through November 2017, depending on the availability for a given case and in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive.
912750_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	In certain early-life cases, estimates of proved producing reserves were guided by analogy to the decline trends of older, more established wells.
912750_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder Scott by Newfield or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
912750_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	The proved developed non-producing reserves that we reviewed were estimated based on historical performance trends before the wells were shut-in.
912750_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	The proved undeveloped reserves that we reviewed were estimated by analogy.
912750_18_ITEM15_P49_S2	The data utilized from the analogues were provided to Ryder Scott by Newfield or were obtained by us from public data sources that were available through August to December 2017, depending on the case.
912750_18_ITEM15_P49_S3	The data utilized from the shut-in wells and from the analogues and incorporated into our analysis were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
912750_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves, many factors and assumptions are considered including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.
912750_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in conducting this review.
912750_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	As stated previously, proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_18_ITEM15_P52_S1	To confirm that the proved reserves reviewed by us meet the SEC requirements to be economically producible, we have reviewed certain primary economic data utilized by Newfield relating to hydrocarbon prices and costs as noted herein.
912750_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	The hydrocarbon prices furnished by Newfield for the properties reviewed by us are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract.
912750_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described.
912750_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	The initial SEC hydrocarbon prices in effect on December 31, 2017 for the properties reviewed by us were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold.
912750_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein.
912750_18_ITEM15_P54_S2	The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used by Newfield for the geographic area(s) reviewed by us.
912750_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	The product prices which were actually used by Newfield to determine the future gross revenue for each property reviewed by us reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, certain handling and processing fees, certain transportation costs, and/or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials.
912750_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	The differentials used by Newfield were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	The table below summarizes Newfield s net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials for the properties reviewed by us and referred to herein as Newfield s average realized prices.
912750_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from Newfield s estimate of the total future gross revenue before production taxes for the properties reviewed by us and Newfield s estimate of the total net reserves for the properties reviewed by us for the geographic area.
912750_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	The data shown in the table below is presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas reviewed by us.
912750_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	The effects of derivative instruments designated as price hedges of oil and gas quantities are not reflected in Newfield s individual property evaluations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Accumulated gas production imbalances, if any, were not taken into account in the proved gas reserve estimates reviewed.
912750_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	The proved gas volumes presented herein include volumes of gas consumed in operations as reserves.
912750_18_ITEM15_P59_S2	These volumes have been offset with gas price reductions equivalent to the value of the consumed gas.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report were provided by Newfield and were represented to be based on their operating expense reports and to include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells for the properties reviewed by us.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S2	For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S3	The operating costs for non-operated properties include the COPAS overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S4	In the case of the international properties located offshore in the South China Sea, the cost recoverable expense and investment amounts have been deducted according to the terms of the Production Sharing Contracts.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S5	Furthermore, certain Windfall Profits Levy and Export Duty costs are included as Operating Cost deductions.
912750_18_ITEM15_P60_S6	For various U.S. properties, certain transportation, processing and handling fees which are separate for those mentioned above as price differentials are included as Other deductions.
912750_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	The operating costs provided to us were accepted as factual data.
912750_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells.
912750_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	Development costs furnished by Newfield are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects.
912750_18_ITEM15_P62_S1	The development costs furnished by Newfield were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P62_S2	The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included by Newfield for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were significant.
912750_18_ITEM15_P62_S3	Newfield s estimates of the net abandonment costs were accepted without independent verification.
912750_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves for the properties reviewed by us have been incorporated herein in accordance with Newfield s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	The implementation of Newfield s development plans as presented to us is subject to the approval process adopted by Newfield s management.
912750_18_ITEM15_P63_S2	As the result of our inquiries during the course of our review, Newfield has informed us that the development activities for the properties reviewed by us have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Newfield s management at the appropriate local, regional and/or corporate level.
912750_18_ITEM15_P63_S3	In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	While these plans could change from those under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2017, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Current costs used by Newfield were held constant throughout the life of the properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	Newfield s forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production.
912750_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were based on the decline trends of analogous wells.
912750_18_ITEM15_P66_S2	If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
912750_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	Test data, analogy data and other related information were used by Newfield to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing.
912750_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P67_S2	Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in Newfield s estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production.
912750_18_ITEM15_P67_S3	Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
912750_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions, producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
912750_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	Certain proved reserves associated with Newfield s international assets reported herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production, unless evidence indicates that contract renewal is reasonably certain.
912750_18_ITEM15_P69_S1	Furthermore, properties in different countries may be subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to Newfield for the production of these volumes.
912750_18_ITEM15_P69_S2	The prices and economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts.
912750_18_ITEM15_P69_S3	Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with Newfield the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof.
912750_18_ITEM15_P69_S4	Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information.
912750_18_ITEM15_P69_S5	Neither our review of such contractual information nor our acceptance of Newfield s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal opinion on this matter.
912750_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	Ryder Scott did not evaluate the country and geopolitical risks in the countries where Newfield operates or has interests.
912750_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	Newfield s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax, and foreign trade and investment and are subject to change from time to time.
912750_18_ITEM15_P71_S2	Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities.
912750_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a review of the properties in which Newfield owns and derives an interest; however, we have not made any field examination of the properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	nor were any costs included by Newfield for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
912750_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	Certain technical personnel of Newfield are responsible for the preparation of reserve estimates on new properties and for the preparation of revised estimates, when necessary, on old properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	These personnel assembled the necessary data and maintained the data and workpapers in an orderly manner.
912750_18_ITEM15_P74_S2	We consulted with these technical personnel and had access to their workpapers and supporting data in the course of our audit.
912750_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	Newfield has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	In performing our audit of Newfield s forecast of future proved production, we have relied upon data furnished by Newfield with respect to property interests owned or derived, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, Production Sharing Contract terms, development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, and pressure measurements.
912750_18_ITEM15_P75_S2	Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P75_S3	We consider the factual data furnished to us by Newfield to be appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of our review of Newfield s estimates of reserves and future net income.
912750_18_ITEM15_P75_S4	In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used by Newfield and as reviewed by us appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to render the conclusions set forth herein.
912750_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	Based on our review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Newfield, it is our opinion that the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Newfield in preparing their estimates of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 comply with the current SEC regulations and that the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Newfield are, in the aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines of 10 percent as set forth in the SPE auditing standards.
912750_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	Ryder Scott found the processes and controls used by Newfield in their estimation of proved reserves to be effective and, in the aggregate, we found no bias in the utilization and analysis of data in estimates for these properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	We were in reasonable agreement with Newfield's estimates of proved reserves for the properties which we reviewed; although in certain cases there was more than an acceptable variance between Newfield's estimates and our estimates due to a difference in interpretation of data or due to our having access to data which were not available to Newfield when its reserve estimates were prepared.
912750_18_ITEM15_P77_S1	However notwithstanding, it is our opinion that on an aggregate basis the data presented herein for the properties that we reviewed fairly reflects the estimated net reserves owned by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	Other properties, as used herein, are those properties of Newfield which we did not review.
912750_18_ITEM15_P78_S1	The proved net reserves attributable to the other properties account for 70 percent of the total proved net liquid hydrocarbon reserves and 92 percent of the total proved net gas reserves based on estimates prepared by Newfield as of December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	natural gas equal one barrel of oil equivalent, the other properties represent 79 percent of the total proved reserves of Newfield.

912750_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
912750_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K.
912750_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations .
912750_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010.
912750_18_ITEM15_P96_S1	Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
912750_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made.
912750_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data.
912750_18_ITEM15_P97_S3	The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
912750_18_ITEM15_P97_S4	Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
912750_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC.
912750_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
912750_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change.
912750_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods.
912750_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery.
912750_18_ITEM15_P100_S2	Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids.
912750_18_ITEM15_P100_S3	Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
912750_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale.
912750_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits.
912750_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
912750_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
912750_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
912750_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
912750_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.
912750_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
912750_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible.
912750_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
912750_18_ITEM15_P108_S2	Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
912750_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
912750_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
912750_18_ITEM15_P112_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
912750_18_ITEM15_P113_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_18_ITEM15_P115_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
912750_18_ITEM15_P116_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_18_ITEM15_P116_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_18_ITEM15_P117_S0	Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs.
912750_18_ITEM15_P117_S1	Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
912750_18_ITEM15_P118_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
912750_18_ITEM15_P120_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
912750_18_ITEM15_P121_S0	While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
912750_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	Developed Producing Reserves Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate.
912750_18_ITEM15_P123_S0	Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P124_S0	Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
912750_18_ITEM15_P125_S0	Shut-In Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from: (1) completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing; (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
912750_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	Behind-Pipe Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
912750_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
912750_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows:
912750_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
912750_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
912750_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
912750_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
912750_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent Inc. 4 Waterway Square Place Suite 100 The Woodlands, Texas 77380 Ladies and Gentlemen:
912750_18_ITEM15_P133_S1	Pursuant to your request, we have conducted an audit of the estimates of the net proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas reserves, as of December 31, 2017, prepared by the engineering staff of Newfield Exploration Mid-Continent Inc. (Newfield) for working and royalty interests in Oklahoma that Newfield has represented it owns.
912750_18_ITEM15_P133_S2	This evaluation was completed on January 16, 2018.
912750_18_ITEM15_P133_S3	Newfield has represented to us that these properties account for approximately 97 percent on a net equivalent barrel basis of Newfield s net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, and that the net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States.
912750_18_ITEM15_P133_S4	We have reviewed information provided to us by Newfield that it represents to be Newfield s estimates of the net reserves, as of December 31, 2017, for the same properties as those which we evaluated.
912750_18_ITEM15_P133_S5	This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves as represented by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P134_S1	Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum remaining to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2017.
912750_18_ITEM15_P134_S2	Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by Newfield after deducting all interests owned by others.
912750_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and gas reserves should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available.
912750_18_ITEM15_P135_S1	Not only are such reserves estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
912750_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	Data used in this audit were obtained from reviews with Newfield personnel, from Newfield files, from records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources.
912750_18_ITEM15_P136_S1	In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Newfield with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented.
912750_18_ITEM15_P136_S2	It was not considered necessary to make a field examination of the physical condition and operation of the properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	Methodology and Procedures Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry, which are presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers PRMS and publications of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers Monograph III and IV.
912750_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	A performance-based methodology integrating the appropriate geology and petroleum engineering data was utilized for the evaluation of all reserves categories.
912750_18_ITEM15_P138_S1	Performance-based methodology primarily includes (1) production diagnostics, (2) decline-curve analysis, and (3) model-based analysis (if necessary, based on availability of data).
912750_18_ITEM15_P138_S2	Production diagnostics include data quality control, identification of flow regimes, and characteristic well performance behavior.
912750_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	Analysis was performed for all well groupings (or type-curve areas).
912750_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	Characteristic rate-decline profiles from diagnostic interpretation were translated to modified hyperbolic rate profiles, including one or multiple b-exponent values followed by an exponential decline.
912750_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	Based on the availability of data, model-based analysis may be integrated to evaluate long-term decline behavior, the impact of dynamic reservoir and fracture parameters on well performance, and complex situations sourced by the nature of unconventional reservoirs.
912750_18_ITEM15_P140_S2	The methodology used for the analysis was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, production history, and the appropriate reserves definitions.
912750_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by Newfield, and the analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved.
912750_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	In certain cases, when the previously named methods could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available.
912750_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as marketable gas.
912750_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	Marketable gas is defined as the sum of sales gas and fuel gas.
912750_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel use, flare, and shrinkage resulting from field separation and processing.
912750_18_ITEM15_P144_S2	Fuel gas is that portion of the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs used in the operation of the fields.
912750_18_ITEM15_P144_S3	Newfield accounts for fuel gas quantities with shrinkage and gas price reductions that are equivalent to the value of the gas quantities consumed in operations and therefore fuel gas cannot be quantified herein.
912750_18_ITEM15_P144_S4	Gas quantities are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at a pressure base of 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute.
912750_18_ITEM15_P144_S5	Gas quantities included herein are expressed in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf).
912750_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are those to be recovered by conventional lease separation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	NGL reserves are those attributed to the leasehold interests according to yields provided by Newfield.
912750_18_ITEM15_P145_S2	Oil, condensate, and NGL reserves included herein are expressed in barrels (bbl) representing 42 United States gallons per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM15_P145_S3	For reporting purposes, oil and condensate reserves have been estimated separately and are presented herein as a summed quantity.
912750_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	Definition of Reserves Petroleum reserves estimated by Newfield included in this report are classified as proved.
912750_18_ITEM15_P146_S1	Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report.
912750_18_ITEM15_P146_S2	Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC.
912750_18_ITEM15_P146_S3	Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment.
912750_18_ITEM15_P146_S4	In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_18_ITEM15_P146_S5	The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
912750_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	Proved oil and gas reserves - Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P147_S1	The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
912750_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
912750_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
912750_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
912750_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
912750_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
912750_18_ITEM15_P153_S1	The price shall be the average price during the 12 month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
912750_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	Developed oil and gas reserves - Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
912750_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
912750_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	Undeveloped oil and gas reserves - Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
912750_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
912750_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
912750_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.4-10 (a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
912750_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	The following economic assumptions were used for estimating future prices and costs: Oil, Condensate, and NGL Prices Newfield has represented that the oil, condensate, and NGL prices were based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_18_ITEM15_P160_S1	The oil, condensate, and NGL prices were calculated using differentials furnished by Newfield to the reference price of $51.34 per barrel.
912750_18_ITEM15_P160_S2	The resulting volume-weighted average prices over the lives of the properties were $50.63 per barrel of oil and condensate and $27.59 per barrel of NGL.
912750_18_ITEM15_P161_S0	Gas Prices Newfield has represented that the gas prices were based on Henry Hub pricing, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
912750_18_ITEM15_P161_S1	The gas prices were calculated for each property using differentials, including reductions due to fuel gas, furnished by Newfield to the reference price of $2.98 per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and held constant thereafter.
912750_18_ITEM15_P161_S2	The resulting volume-weighted average price over the lives of the properties was $2.804 per thousand cubic feet.
912750_18_ITEM15_P162_S0	Production Taxes Production taxes were calculated using the tax rates for Oklahoma.
912750_18_ITEM15_P162_S1	Operating Expenses, Capital Costs, and Abandonment Costs Estimates of operating expenses, provided by Newfield and based on current expenses, were held constant for the lives of the properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P162_S2	Future capital expenditures were estimated using 2017 values, provided by Newfield, and were not adjusted for inflation.
912750_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	Abandonment costs, which are those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of the wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment, were included for all properties.
912750_18_ITEM15_P164_S0	Newfield has represented that its estimated net proved reserves attributable to the reviewed properties were based on the definitions of proved reserves of the SEC.
912750_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	that its estimates of the net proved reserves attributable to these properties, which represent 97 percent of Newfield s total proved reserves on a net equivalent basis, are summarized as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf), and thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe):
912750_18_ITEM15_P166_S0	In comparing the detailed net proved reserves estimates prepared by us and by Newfield, we have found differences, both positive and negative, resulting in an aggregate difference of less than 10 percent when compared on the basis of net equivalent barrels and is within the established audit tolerance standards established by the SPE Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information .
912750_18_ITEM15_P166_S1	It is our opinion that there is no material difference between the net proved reserves estimates prepared by Newfield and those prepared by us for those properties we audited.
912750_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves of oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, and 932 235-50-9 of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas (Topic 932): Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided, however, that estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year.
912750_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.
912750_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant s ability to recover its reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the December 31, 2017, estimated reserves.
