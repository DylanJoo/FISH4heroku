69891_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a complete portfolio of quality beverage products throughout the United States.
69891_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries.
69891_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.
69891_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We consider ourselves to be a leader in the development and sale of flavored beverage products in the United States, offering a wide selection of flavored soft drinks, juices, sparkling waters, energy drinks and nutritionally-enhanced waters.
69891_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our flavor development spans over 100 years originating with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo , each of which has over 50 flavor varieties.
69891_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	We also offer the health-conscious consumer a diverse line of flavored beverage products, including Everfresh , Home Juice and Mr. Pure 100% juice and juice-based products; LaCroix , Crystal Bay and ClearFruit flavored, sparkling and spring water products; and Sant nutritionally-enhanced waters.
69891_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	In addition, we produce and market Rip It energy drinks, Ohana fruit-flavored drinks, St. Nick s holiday soft drinks, as well as effervescent powder beverage enhancers sold under the NutraFizz brand name.
69891_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	Substantially all of our brands are produced in twelve manufacturing facilities that are strategically located near major metropolitan markets throughout the continental United States.
69891_11_ITEM1_P2_S5	To a lesser extent, we develop and produce soft drinks for certain retailers and beverage companies.
69891_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We utilize various means to maintain and strengthen our position as a cost-effective producer of beverage products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	These include centralized purchasing of raw materials, vertical integration of the manufacturing process, close proximity to customer distribution centers, regionally targeted media promotions and the use of multiple distribution systems.
69891_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe the strength of our brands and location of our manufacturing facilities distinguish us as a national supplier of beverages to national and regional retailers, mass merchandisers, wholesalers and discount stores.
69891_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our strategy emphasizes the growth of our products by offering a branded beverage portfolio of proprietary flavors, supporting the franchise value of regional brands and expanding those brands with distinctive packaging and broad demographic emphasis, developing and acquiring innovative products tailored toward healthy lifestyles and appealing to the quality-value expectations of the family consumer.
69891_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We believe the regional share dynamics of our brands results in more retailer sponsored promotional activities which perpetuate consumer loyalty within local markets.
69891_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Shasta and Faygo, our traditional soft drink brands that emphasize flavor variety and innovation, have been manufactured and marketed throughout the United States for a combined period of over 200 years.
69891_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Established more than 120 years ago and distributed nationally, Shasta is the largest of National Beverage s brands and includes multiple flavors of carbonated soft drinks as well as various water products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Established over 100 years ago, Faygo products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include a multi-flavored product line.
69891_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	We also produce and market other brands of soft drinks, juices, waters and other beverages, including Ritz , Big Shot , Everfresh, Mr. Pure, LaCroix, Crystal Bay, Ohana, Rip It, Mega Sport and Sant .
69891_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our fantasy of flavors strategy emphasizes distinctively flavored soft drinks, energy drinks, juices and other specialty beverages.
69891_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Although cola drinks account for approximately 50% of the soft drink industry s domestic grocery channel volume, colas account for less than 20% of our total volume.
69891_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	We continue to emphasize expanding our beverage portfolio beyond traditional carbonated soft drinks through new product development inspired by lifestyle enhancement trends, innovative package enhancements and the development of products designed to provide functional benefits to the consumer.
69891_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	Such products include our lines of energy drinks and vitamin-enhanced waters.
69891_11_ITEM1_P8_S4	We intend to expand our product offerings through in-house development and acquisitions, to further our strategy within the evolving functional category geared toward consumer health and wellness.
69891_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our twelve manufacturing facilities are strategically located near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States, enabling us to efficiently manufacture and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States.
69891_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	Each manufacturing facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes.
69891_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	We utilize numerous package types and sizes, including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from seven ounces to three liters.
69891_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe that ownership of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions.
69891_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can manufacture our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences.
69891_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network servicing the United States, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers.
69891_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations.
69891_11_ITEM1_P11_S4	These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.
69891_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	We utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
69891_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system.
69891_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods.
69891_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	These include development of products specifically targeted to this market, such as ClearFruit, Crystal Bay, Rip It and Sant .
69891_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	Additionally, we have created proprietary and specialized packaging with distinctive graphics for these products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other institutions.
69891_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.
69891_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as select broker networks.
69891_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our sales and marketing programs emphasize maintaining and enhancing consumer brand recognition and loyalty and typically utilize a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements and sponsorships, along with consumer coupon distribution.
69891_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	We retain advertising agencies to assist with media advertising programs for our brands.
69891_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives.
69891_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	These elements allow us to tailor marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics.
69891_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	We also seek to maintain points of difference between our brands and those of our competitors by combining high product quality, flavor innovation, unique packaging designs and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_11_ITEM1_P20_S5	Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions including St. Nick s soft drinks, which feature special holiday flavors and packaging.
69891_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our regional share dynamics strategy emphasizes the acquisition and support of brands that have significant regional presence.
69891_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	We believe our brands enjoy a regional identification that foster long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to brand substitution.
69891_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	In addition, home-town products often generate more aggressive retailer sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities and other local events.
69891_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods.
69891_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our manufacturing facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby allowing us to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.
69891_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials, including sweeteners, juice concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and ends, paper, cartons and closures.
69891_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame or Acesulfame-K. We manufacture a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles and high fructose corn syrup, are derived from commodities.
69891_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide market conditions.
69891_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_11_ITEM1_P24_S5	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	We have sufficient production capacity to meet seasonal increases without maintaining significant quantities of inventory in anticipation of periods of peak demand.
69891_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Sales volume may be affected by weather conditions.
69891_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas.
69891_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_11_ITEM1_P27_S5	We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong regional brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, specialized advertising and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
69891_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
69891_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our management believes that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers.
69891_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
69891_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
69891_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position.
69891_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
69891_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
69891_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	As of April 30, 2011, we employed approximately 1,200 people, of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
69891_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that relations with employees are generally good.
69891_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	In addition, our Code of Ethics is available on our website.
69891_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in consumer preferences and taste.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers, which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health, wellness and/or functionality.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discounting and other action by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our inability to meet the demands of our larger customers could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, linerboard and corn.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have considered imposing taxes on soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
69891_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher operating costs.
69891_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve manufacturing facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten manufacturing facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two manufacturing facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet present needs.
69891_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease office and warehouse space, transportation equipment, office equipment, information systems equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
69891_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The common stock of National Beverage Corp., par value $.01 per share, ( Common Stock ) is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FIZZ .
69891_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the range of high and low prices per share of the Common Stock for the fiscal quarters indicated:
69891_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	At July 5, 2011, there were approximately 4,300 holders of our Common Stock, the majority of which hold their shares in the names of various dealers and/or clearing agencies.

69891_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for certain restrictions on the payment of dividends.
69891_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	In January 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 800,000 shares of National Beverage common stock of which 502,060 shares have been purchased.
69891_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	There were no shares purchased during the last three fiscal years.
69891_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph shows a comparison of the five-year cumulative returns of an investment of $100 cash on April 29, 2006, assuming reinvestment of dividends, in (i) our Common Stock, (ii) the NASDAQ Composite Index and (iii) a company-constructed peer group consisting of Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated and Cott Corporation.
69891_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	On October 2, 2010, the North American operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. were acquired by The Coca-Cola Company; therefore, Coca-Cola Enterprises is no longer included in the company-constructed peer group.
69891_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and the accompanying notes listed in Item 8 of this report.
69891_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a complete portfolio of quality beverage products throughout the United States.
69891_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries.
69891_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.
69891_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	We consider ourselves to be a leader in the development and sale of flavored beverage products in the United States, offering a wide selection of flavored soft drinks, juices, sparkling waters, energy drinks and nutritionally-enhanced waters.
69891_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our flavor development spans over 100 years originating with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo , each of which has over 50 flavor varieties.
69891_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	We also offer the health-conscious consumer a diverse line of flavored beverage products, including Everfresh , Home Juice and Mr. Pure 100% juice and juice-based products; LaCroix , Crystal Bay and ClearFruit flavored, sparkling and spring water products; and Sant nutritionally-enhanced waters.
69891_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	In addition, we produce and market Rip It energy drinks, Ohana fruit-flavored drinks, St. Nick s holiday soft drinks, as well as effervescent powder beverage enhancers sold under the NutraFizz brand name.
69891_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	Substantially all of our brands are produced in twelve manufacturing facilities that are strategically located near major metropolitan markets throughout the continental United States.
69891_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	To a lesser extent, we develop and produce soft drinks for certain retailers and beverage companies ( allied brands ).
69891_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our strategy emphasizes the growth of our products by offering a branded beverage portfolio of proprietary flavors, supporting the franchise value of regional brands and expanding those brands with distinctive packaging and broad demographic emphasis, developing and acquiring innovative products tailored toward healthy lifestyles and appealing to the quality-value expectations of the family consumer.
69891_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe the regional share dynamics of our brands results in more retailer sponsored promotional activities which perpetuate consumer loyalty within local markets.
69891_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our focus is to increase penetration of our brands in the convenience channel through Company-owned and independent distributors.
69891_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail in this market, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	These measures include development of new products and serving sizes specifically targeted for this market, such as ClearFruit, Crystal Bay, Rip It and Sant .
69891_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Additionally, we have created proprietary and specialized packaging with distinctive graphics for these products.
69891_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	We intend to continue our focus on enhancing growth in the convenience channel through both specialized packaging and innovative product development.
69891_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Beverage industry sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Additionally, our operating results are subject to numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, changes in consumer preference for beverage products and competitive pricing in the marketplace.

69891_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The gross margin improvement was due to higher sales volume, favorable changes in product mix and lower raw material costs.
69891_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Cost of sales decreased 4.4% on a per case basis.
69891_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies.

69891_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $145,159,000 or 24.5% of net sales for Fiscal 2010 compared to $131,918,000 or 22.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2009.

69891_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of the manufacturing deduction and state income taxes.
69891_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, which may be supplemented by borrowings available under our credit facilities.

69891_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Prepaid and other assets increased $4,219,000 primarily due to an increase in derivative assets.
69891_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

69891_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	We have guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $11,300,000.

69891_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for the specific periods indicated in the table above.
69891_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	In connection with our self-insurance programs, we have standby letters of credit aggregating $2,639,000, which expire in fiscal 2012.
69891_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	We expect to renew these standby letters of credit.
69891_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers which require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	In those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	When the incentive is paid in arrears, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_11_ITEM7_P41_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup and various juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We had no debt-related interest rate exposure during Fiscal 2011.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our investment portfolio is comprised of highly liquid securities consisting primarily of short-term money market investments, the yields of which fluctuate based largely on short-term Treasury rates.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

69891_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	We use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in raw material costs.
69891_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_11_ITEM8_P3_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	The fair values of our cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
69891_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	The estimated fair values of our derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.

69891_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	Intangible assets as of April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks.
69891_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.

69891_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	Marketing costs are expensed when incurred, except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place.

69891_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options, which amounted to 185,000 shares in Fiscal 2011, 229,000 shares in Fiscal 2010 and 192,000 shares in Fiscal 2009.
69891_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	Options to purchase 291,000 shares in Fiscal 2011, 18,000 shares in Fiscal 2010 and 33,000 shares in Fiscal 2009 were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because these options were antidilutive.
69891_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements, and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_11_ITEM8_P17_S3	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers which require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	In those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	When the incentive is paid in arrears, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_11_ITEM8_P18_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_11_ITEM8_P18_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of income.
69891_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Such costs aggregated $45,071,000 in Fiscal 2011, $43,004,000 in Fiscal 2010 and $44,096,000 in Fiscal 2009.
69891_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.

69891_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	As of April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.

69891_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Credit Facility expires on April 30, 2013 and, currently, any borrowings would bear interest at .3% above LIBOR or, at our election, .5% below the bank s reference rate.
69891_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	At April 30, 2011, $2,639,000 of the Credit Facility was used for standby letters of credit and $47,361,000 was available for borrowings.
69891_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Credit Facility requires the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, principally debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement), and contains other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.
69891_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	At April 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all loan covenants and approximately $1,320,000 of retained earnings was restricted from distribution.
69891_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	On July 8, 2011, the subsidiary entered into an additional $25,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with a bank which expires on July 8, 2013 and contains similar financial covenants.

69891_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.

69891_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	We have entered into various aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans through April 2012.
69891_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The financial instruments were designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010:
69891_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	As of April 30, 2011, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $15,302,000 and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $4,069,000 of unrealized net gain (before tax) will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next twelve months.
69891_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	As of April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010, the fair value of derivative assets was $4,271,000 and $4,000, respectively, which was included in Prepaid and other assets.
69891_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	Other (expense) income consisted of the following:
69891_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:

69891_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $3,700,000.
69891_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	As of April 30, 2011, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $560,000, of which approximately $59,000 was recognized as tax expense in Fiscal 2011.
69891_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved.
69891_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_11_ITEM8_P52_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_11_ITEM8_P52_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2006 are subject to examination.
69891_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2006.
69891_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the stockholders.

69891_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to the officers (including those who are also directors) and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	Options generally vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of Common Stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_11_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Board of Directors also authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are automatically forfeited in the event of the sale of shares originally acquired by the participant.
69891_11_ITEM8_P58_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.
69891_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	Generally, stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and have a 10-year term.
69891_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Stock options granted in Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were 301,500 shares and 3,000 shares, respectively.
69891_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	There were no stock options or other stock-based awards granted in Fiscal 2009.
69891_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 7.5 years for Fiscal 2011 and 8.0 years for Fiscal 2010; weighted average expected volatility of 48.6% for Fiscal 2011 and 52.2% for Fiscal 2010; weighted average risk free interest rates of 2.8% for Fiscal 2011 and 3.4% for Fiscal 2010; and expected dividend yield of 4.3% for Fiscal 2011 and 4% for Fiscal 2010.
69891_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_11_ITEM8_P61_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.
69891_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	The following is a summary of stock option activity for Fiscal 2011:

69891_11_ITEM8_P66_S2	Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

69891_11_ITEM8_P72_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_11_ITEM8_P72_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_11_ITEM8_P73_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_11_ITEM8_P73_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_11_ITEM8_P73_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_11_ITEM8_P73_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of April 30, 2011 and May 1, 2010 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
69891_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of April 30, 2011.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
69891_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	McGladrey Pullen, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

69891_11_ITEM15_P305_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of National Beverage Corp. (the Company ) on Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2011 (the Report ), I, George R. Bracken, Senior Vice President - Finance of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 1350, as adopted pursuant to section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
69891_11_ITEM15_P306_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and result of operations of the Company.
69891_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	National Beverage Corp. is an acknowledged leader in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products.
69891_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our primary focus is the United States, but our products are also distributed in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
69891_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	A holding company for various operating subsidiaries, National Beverage Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991.
69891_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.
69891_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our brands include soft drinks, energy drinks and shots, juices, teas, still and sparkling waters and nutritionally enhanced beverages, and span both carbonated and non-carbonated offerings.
69891_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition, we produce soft drinks for certain retailers ( Allied Brands ) who also promote certain of our brands ( Strategic Alliances ).
69891_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	We employ a philosophy that demands vertical integration wherever possible and our vertically integrated manufacturing model unites the procurement of raw materials, production of concentrates and manufacturing of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities.
69891_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as hundreds of smaller up and down the street accounts, we have developed a hybrid distribution system which promotes and utilizes customers warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	We believe that the combination of our business strategies and philosophies is key to giving us a greater competitive advantage and differentiating us from our competitors.
69891_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Fantasy of Flavors - Throughout our product lines, we emphasize distinctly flavored beverages.
69891_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Although cola drinks account for approximately 50% of the soft drink industry s domestic grocery channel volume, colas account for less than 20% of our total volume.
69891_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	In the higher margin convenience store channel, flavors now represent 56% of soft drink sales and are growing significantly faster than colas.
69891_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our flavor development spans more than 100 years and originated with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo, each of which offer over 50 flavor varieties.
69891_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Regional Share Dynamics This is our term for the philosophy we employ for the development and support of our brands that have significant regional presence.
69891_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Because we tailor our marketing and promotion programs by locale, we believe many of our brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to competitive substitution.
69891_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, home-town products often generate more aggressive retailer sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising.
69891_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	We believe that consumers demand value as the purchase default option in volatile economic times, and we are intent on producing and developing products of the highest quality that appeal to the value expectations of the family consumer.
69891_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe we can leverage our cost-effective manufacturing and distribution systems, and our efficient regionally focused marketing programs, to profitably deliver products to the consumer at a lower price-point than our national competitors.
69891_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Creative Agility - In a beverage industry that is dominated by the cola giants , we pride ourselves on our ability to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than many of our competitors which are burdened by distribution complexity and legacy costs.
69891_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We strive to build long-term brand value by developing creative marketing programs, propriety flavors and distinctive packaging.
69891_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	During the past year we have introduced 54 new flavors or package sizes, and have won various package design awards.
69891_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	During recent years, we have focused on developing innovative beverages tailored toward healthy lifestyles and introducing products and package sizes designed to expand distribution in the higher-margin convenience store channel.
69891_12_ITEM1_P8_S4	We believe that the most dynamic validation of our strategy is our competitors efforts to replicate our creative business model.
69891_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Established more than 120 years ago and distributed nationally, Shasta is recognized to be a bottling industry pioneer and innovator.
69891_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	As our largest volume brand, Shasta features multiple flavors, including products targeted to the growing Hispanic and other ethnic markets, and continues to earn consumer loyalty by delivering value, convenience and unique tastes such as California Dreamin , Very Cherry Twist and Fiesta Punch.
69891_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	More than one hundred years old, Faygo products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include numerous unique flavors including RedPop, Moon Mist and Rock n Rye .
69891_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	We also produce and market Ritz soft drinks and seltzers, primarily in the southeast U.S., and distribute Big Shot in New Orleans and the surrounding areas.
69891_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Rip It, our energy fuel which is available nationally in 17 flavors including five sugar free varieties, is the number one energy drink in the dollar-store channel.
69891_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Building on the success of Rip It, we recently introduced two-ounce Rip It Shots in five flavors, including a new G-Force Extra Strength Formula.
69891_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	For consumers seeking vitamin-enhanced hydration, we offer Mega Sport in six reinvigorating flavors.
69891_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Everfresh and its sister brands, Home Juice and Mr. Pure, 100% fresh juice and juice-added products, are available in over 30 flavors including Blueberry Pomegranate, Kiwi Strawberry and Pineapple Mango.
69891_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Originating in the Midwest over 50 years ago, these brands feature unique glass packaging targeted primarily for single-serve consumption.
69891_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	As the most agile regional juice company, we have been successfully expanding to new geographic areas through both independent and Company-owned distribution facilities.
69891_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	With all natural ingredients, LaCroix has been outpacing the growing sparkling water segment that is fast becoming the alternative to traditional carbonated soft drinks.
69891_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Containing no calories, sodium or caffeine, LaCroix has benefited from the support of major national chains and is the number one selling canned sparkling water in the U.S. as well as the number one domestically produced sparkling water.
69891_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	With new packages being designed for non-traditional distribution channels, we believe LaCroix is uniquely positioned to continue expanding its national footprint.
69891_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	Other products we offer the health-conscious consumer include Clear Fruit, a clean crisp all natural non-carbonated beverage; Crystal Bay, a zero-calorie combination of sparkling water and lively fruit flavors; sant , a 50-calorie vitamin enhanced nutraceutical beverage; and Mt. Shasta, a natural spring water.
69891_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our other non-carbonated products include the Ohana line of fruit drinks, lemonades and teas, and the Sundance line, which features brewed tea combined with great fruit flavors and reduced calories.
69891_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We refer to our portfolio of brands other than soft drinks as our Power+ Brands .
69891_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our twelve manufacturing facilities are strategically located near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States.
69891_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	The locations of our plants enable us to efficiently manufacture and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including 22 of the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas.
69891_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Each manufacturing facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes.
69891_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	We utilize numerous package types and sizes, including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from seven ounces to three liters.
69891_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products.
69891_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions.
69891_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products.
69891_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can manufacture our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences.
69891_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations.
69891_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.
69891_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	We utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
69891_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system.
69891_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods.
69891_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	These include development of products, packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
69891_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food service customers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.
69891_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	In addition to foreign based customers, we distribute our brands outside of the United States through exporters and foreign locations of U.S. based companies.
69891_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as select broker networks.
69891_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our sales and marketing programs emphasize maintaining and enhancing consumer brand recognition and loyalty and typically utilize a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements and sponsorships, along with consumer coupon distribution.
69891_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	We retain advertising agencies to assist with media advertising programs for our brands.
69891_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives.
69891_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	These elements allow us to tailor marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics.
69891_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick s soft drink and special holiday flavors and packaging.
69891_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods.
69891_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our manufacturing facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby allowing us to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.
69891_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners, juice concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and ends, paper, cartons and closures.
69891_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame, stevia or Acesulfame-K. We manufacture a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corregated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities.
69891_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide market conditions.
69891_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_12_ITEM1_P32_S5	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We have sufficient production capacity to meet seasonal increases without maintaining significant quantities of inventory in anticipation of periods of peak demand.
69891_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	Additionally, our sales are affected by weather conditions.
69891_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas.
69891_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong regional brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, specialized advertising and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
69891_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
69891_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our management believes that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers.
69891_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
69891_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
69891_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position.
69891_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
69891_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
69891_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	As of April 28, 2012, we employed approximately 1,200 people, of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
69891_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	We believe that relations with employees are generally good.
69891_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	In addition, our Code of Ethics is available on our website.
69891_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in consumer preferences and taste.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers, which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health, wellness and/or functionality.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our inability to meet the demands of our larger customers could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard and fruit juice.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have considered imposing taxes on soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
69891_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher operating costs.
69891_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve manufacturing facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten manufacturing facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two manufacturing facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease office and warehouse space, transportation equipment, office equipment, information systems equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
69891_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	The common stock of National Beverage Corp., par value $.01 per share, ( Common Stock ) is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FIZZ .
69891_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table shows the range of high and low prices per share of the Common Stock for the fiscal quarters indicated:
69891_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	At July 3, 2012, there were approximately 6,000 holders of our Common Stock, the majority of which hold their shares in the names of various dealers and/or clearing agencies.

69891_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable.
69891_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additionally, our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, changes in consumer preference for beverage products, competitive pricing in the marketplace and weather conditions.
69891_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Net sales for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2012 ( Fiscal 2012 ) increased 4.8% to $628.9 million as compared to $600.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011 ( Fiscal 2011 ).
69891_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The sales improvement is due to case volume growth of 9.9% for our Power+ Brands and 1.4% for carbonated soft drinks.
69891_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, our unit pricing increased 1.3% due to price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs.
69891_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Net sales for Fiscal 2011 increased 1.1% to $600.2 million as compared to $593.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 1, 2010 ( Fiscal 2010 ).
69891_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The sales improvement is due to case volume growth of 13.2% for our Power+ Brands, and a 1.2% increase in unit pricing resulting from favorable product mix changes.
69891_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	This sales improvement was partially offset by a 2.1% volume decline for branded carbonated soft drinks due to weak demand in certain regional markets.
69891_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Gross profit approximated 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2012, which represents a 2.5% margin decline compared to Fiscal 2011.
69891_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	During Fiscal 2011 we benefited from sales of certain high margin products to overseas locations.
69891_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	These sales were impacted during Fiscal 2012 and, accordingly, gross margins returned to more normalized levels.
69891_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	The gross margin decline is also due to higher raw material costs and other changes in product mix.
69891_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Cost of sales increased 5.3% on a per case basis.
69891_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Gross profit approximated 36.4% of net sales for Fiscal 2011, which represents a 3.2% margin improvement over Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	This gross margin improvement is primarily due to favorable changes in brand and package mix.
69891_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Cost of sales decreased 3.7% on a per case basis.
69891_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies.
69891_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	However, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $146.2 million or 23.2% of net sales for Fiscal 2012 compared to $155.9 million or 26.0% of net sales for Fiscal 2011.
69891_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The decline in expenses is due to a decrease in marketing and administrative expenses.
69891_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $155.9 million or 26.0% of net sales for Fiscal 2011 compared to $145.2 million or 24.5% of net sales for Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in expenses was primarily due to additional investment in expanded distribution, including expanded marketing and selling programs.
69891_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Marketing costs reflect increased cooperative advertising programs with customers and increased brand support expenditures.
69891_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Interest expense is comprised of interest on borrowings and fees related to maintaining lines of credit.
69891_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Other expense is net of interest income of $69,000 for Fiscal 2012, $140,000 for Fiscal 2011 and $229,000 for Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The decline in interest income for Fiscal 2012 is due to lower average invested balances and investment yields.
69891_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	The decline in interest income for Fiscal 2011 is due to lower investment yields.
69891_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our effective tax rate was approximately 34.2% for Fiscal 2012, 34.9% for Fiscal 2011 and 36.1% for Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and the manufacturing deduction.
69891_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, which may be supplemented by borrowings available under our credit facilities.

69891_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	During Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, cash flow was significantly impacted by the payment of two special cash dividends aggregating $168.6 million.
69891_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	During Fiscal 2012, $37.7 million was provided by operating activities, which was offset by $9.9 million used in investing activities.
69891_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Cash provided by operating activities decreased $17.6 million primarily due to increases in trade receivables and inventories as well as a decline in accrued liabilities.
69891_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Cash used in investing activities decreased $1.5 million due to lower capital expenditures.
69891_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	During Fiscal 2011, $55.3 million was provided by operating activities, offset by $11.3 million used in investing activities and a special cash dividend payment of $106.3 million.

69891_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Cash used in investing activities increased $3.0 million due to expanded capital investments.
69891_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	During Fiscal 2012, our working capital increased $38.9 million to $69.8 million due to cash provided by operating activities.
69891_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Trade receivables increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase in days sales outstanding from approximately 33.4 days to 33.9 days, and inventories increased $7.5 million, which represents a reduction in annual inventory turns from 11.7 to 11 times.
69891_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	These increases are primarily due to the commencement of a new Strategic Alliance agreement in the latter part of Fiscal 2012.
69891_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	The increase in inventory is also due to higher raw material costs and quantity increases related to anticipated sales growth.
69891_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	Prepaid and other assets decreased $4.0 million due to a decline in the fair value of derivative assets.
69891_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	At April 28, 2012, the current ratio was 1.9 to 1, as compared to 1.4 to 1 at April 30, 2011.
69891_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	During Fiscal 2011, our working capital decreased $62.0 million to $30.9 million due to the special cash dividend paid in February 2011.

69891_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	Prepaid and other assets increased $4.2 million primarily due to an increase in the fair value of derivative assets.

69891_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Contractual obligations at April 28, 2012 are payable as follows:
69891_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of April 28, 2012, we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $7.1 million.
69891_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates July 31, 2012, the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount.
69891_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee.
69891_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan.
69891_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Total contributions were $2.5 million for Fiscal 2012, $2.5 million for Fiscal 2011 and $2.3 million for Fiscal 2010.

69891_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for the specific periods indicated in the table above.
69891_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	In connection with our self-insurance programs, we have standby letters of credit aggregating $2.4 million which expire in fiscal 2013.
69891_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	We expect to renew these standby letters of credit.
69891_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	In those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	When the incentive is paid in arrears, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
69891_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success in acquiring other beverage businesses, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies, ability to pass along cost increases to our customers, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unseasonably cold or wet weather conditions and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders.
69891_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corregated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities.
69891_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We had no debt-related interest rate exposure during Fiscal 2012.
69891_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our investment portfolio is comprised of highly liquid securities consisting primarily of short-term money market investments, the yields of which fluctuate based largely on short-term Treasury rates.

69891_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_12_ITEM8_P7_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_12_ITEM8_P7_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	The fair values of our cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
69891_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	The estimated fair values of our derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

69891_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_12_ITEM8_P11_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

69891_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Intangible assets as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks.
69891_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.
69891_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	Inventories at April 28, 2012 were comprised of finished goods of $24.4 million and raw materials of $16.5 million.
69891_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	Inventories at April 30, 2011 were comprised of finished goods of $20.2 million and raw materials of $13.1 million.
69891_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	We are involved in a variety of marketing programs, including cooperative advertising programs with customers, to advertise and promote our products to consumers.
69891_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Marketing costs are expensed when incurred, except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place.
69891_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	Marketing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $45.8 million in Fiscal 2012, $52.9 million in Fiscal 2011 and $44.7 million in Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Diluted net income per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options, which amounted to 181,000 shares in Fiscal 2012, 185,000 shares in Fiscal 2011 and 229,000 shares in Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	Options to purchase 291,000 shares in Fiscal 2011 and 18,000 shares in Fiscal 2010 were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because these options were anti-dilutive.
69891_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements, and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_12_ITEM8_P19_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	In those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	When the incentive is paid in arrears, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of income.
69891_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Such costs aggregated $45.6 million in Fiscal 2012, $45.1 million in Fiscal 2011 and $43.0 million in Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P24_S2	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
69891_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	As of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.
69891_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Property, plant and equipment as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 consisted of the following:
69891_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Depreciation expense was $8.5 million for Fiscal 2012, $9.3 million for Fiscal 2011 and $10.3 million for Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Accrued liabilities as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 consisted of the following:
69891_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	At April 28, 2012, a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $75 million (the Credit Facilities ).
69891_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Credit Facilities expire through July 8, 2013 and, currently, any borrowings would bear interest at .3% to .9% above LIBOR or, at our election, .5% below the banks reference rate.
69891_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	At April 28, 2012, $2.4 million of the Credit Facilities was used for standby letters of credit and $72.6 million was available for borrowings.
69891_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, principally debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreements), and contain other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.
69891_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	At April 28, 2012, we were in compliance with all loan covenants and approximately $1.2 million of retained earnings was restricted from distribution.
69891_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company paid special cash dividends of $106.3 million ($2.30 per share) on February 14, 2011 and $62.3 million ($1.35 per share) on January 22, 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	In April 2012, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company s Stock Buyback Program from 800,000 to 1.6 million shares of common stock.
69891_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	As of April 28, 2012, 502,060 shares were purchased under the program and 1,097,940 shares were available for purchase.
69891_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	There were no shares purchased during the last three fiscal years.
69891_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.
69891_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	While our sales from inception of this agreement have increased 63% and enterprise value has increased 896%, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.3 million for Fiscal 2012, $6.0 million for Fiscal 2011 and $5.9 million for Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P39_S4	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $3.0 million at April 28, 2012.
69891_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	We have entered into various aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans through April 2013.
69891_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	The financial instruments were designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_12_ITEM8_P41_S1	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011:
69891_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	As of April 28, 2012, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $21.7 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $503,000 of unrealized net loss (before tax) will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next twelve months.
69891_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	As of April 28, 2012, the fair value of the derivative liability was $503,000, which was included in Accrued liabilities.
69891_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	As of April 30, 2011, the fair value of the derivative asset was $4.3 million, which was included in Prepaid and other assets.
69891_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Other expense (income) consisted of the following:
69891_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 consisted of the following:
69891_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	As of April 28, 2012, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $4.5 million, of which $89,000 was recognized as tax benefit in Fiscal 2012.
69891_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $3.6 million.
69891_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	As of April 28, 2012, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $540,000, of which approximately $20,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2012.
69891_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2007 are subject to examination.
69891_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2007.
69891_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the stockholders.
69891_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan ) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above.
69891_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_12_ITEM8_P61_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	Stock options granted were 3,000 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2012, 301,500 shares in Fiscal 2011 and 3,000 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P62_S3	The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 8 years for Fiscal 2012, 7.5 years for Fiscal 2011 and 8 years for Fiscal 2010; weighted average expected volatility of 42.9% for Fiscal 2012, 48.6% for Fiscal 2011 and 52.2% for Fiscal 2010; weighted average risk free interest rates of 2.5% for Fiscal 2012, 2.8% for Fiscal 2011 and 3.4% for Fiscal 2010; and expected dividend yield of 5.3% for Fiscal 2012, 4.3% for Fiscal 2011 and 4% for Fiscal 2010.
69891_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_12_ITEM8_P63_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.
69891_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following is a summary of stock option activity for Fiscal 2012:

69891_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company participates in various multi-employer defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements.
69891_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	Under the Pension Protection Act ( PPA ), if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
69891_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multi-employer plan, the Company could be required to pay the plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.
69891_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	Summarized below is certain information regarding the Company s participation in significant multi-employer pension plans including the financial improvement plan or rehabilitation plan status ( FIP/RP Status ).
69891_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The most recent PPA zone status available in Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 is for the plan s years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
69891_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	For the plan years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, the Company was not listed in the pension trust fund forms 5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plans.
69891_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	The collective bargaining agreements covering the above pension trust funds expire on October 18, 2016 for the CSSS Fund and May 14, 2016 for the WCT Fund.
69891_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company s contributions for all multi-employer pension plans for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
69891_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under various non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2020.
69891_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	Certain of these leases contain scheduled rent increases and/or renewal options.
69891_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
69891_12_ITEM8_P74_S3	Rent expense under operating lease agreements totaled approximately $9.3 million for Fiscal 2012, $10.0 million for Fiscal 2011 and $8.9 million for Fiscal 2010.

69891_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	As of April 28, 2012, we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $7.1 million.
69891_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates July 31, 2012, the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount.
69891_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee.
69891_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	We enter into various agreements with suppliers for the purchase of raw materials, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing and minimum purchase quantities.
69891_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	As of April 28, 2012, we had purchase commitments for raw materials of $57.8 million for Fiscal 2013 and $45.0 million for Fiscal 2014.
69891_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
69891_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Beverage Corp. as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 28, 2012.
69891_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	We also have audited National Beverage Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
69891_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_12_ITEM8_P79_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_12_ITEM8_P80_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_12_ITEM8_P80_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_12_ITEM8_P80_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_12_ITEM8_P80_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of April 28, 2012 and April 30, 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 28, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 28, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
69891_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 28, 2012.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
69891_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	McGladrey LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

69891_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and result of operations of the Company.
69891_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	National Beverage Corp. is an acknowledged leader in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products.
69891_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our primary market focus is the United States, but our products are also distributed in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
69891_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	A holding company for various operating subsidiaries, National Beverage Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991.
69891_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.
69891_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our brands consist of (i) carbonated soft drinks in a variety of flavors as well as regular, diet and reduced-calorie options, and (ii) beverages geared toward the active and health-conscious consumer ( Power+ Brands ), including energy drinks and shots, juices, sparkling waters and enhanced beverages.
69891_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition, we produce soft drinks for certain retailers ( Allied Brands ) that endorse the concept ( Strategic Alliance ) of having our brands and the Allied Brands marketed to produce the effect of enhanced growth of both.
69891_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our vertically-integrated manufacturing model unites the procurement of raw materials and production of concentrates with the manufacture of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities.
69891_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as hundreds of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we have developed a hybrid distribution system that promotes and utilizes customers warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the combination of our business strategies and philosophies is key to giving us a greater competitive advantage and differentiating us from our competitors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Fantasy of Flavors Throughout our product lines, we emphasize distinctly flavored beverages.
69891_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Although cola drinks account for approximately 50% of the soft drink industry s domestic grocery channel volume, colas account for less than 20% of our total volume.
69891_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	In the higher margin convenience store channel, flavors now represent 56% of soft drink sales and are outpacing colas.
69891_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our flavor development spans more than 100 years and originated with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo , each of which offers more than 50 flavor varieties.
69891_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Regional Share Dynamics This is our term for the philosophy we employ for the development and support of our brands that have significant regional presence.
69891_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	Because we tailor our marketing and promotion programs by locale, we believe many of our brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to competitive substitution.
69891_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, home-town products often generate more aggressive retailer sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising.
69891_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	We believe that consumers demand value as the purchase default option in volatile economic times, and we are intent on producing and developing products of the highest quality that appeal to the value expectations of the family consumer.
69891_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe we can leverage our cost-effective manufacturing and distribution systems, and our efficient regionally focused marketing programs, to profitably deliver products to the consumer at a lower price-point than our national competitors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Creative Agility In a beverage industry that is dominated by the cola giants , we pride ourselves on our ability to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than many of our competitors which are burdened by distribution complexity and legacy costs.
69891_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We strive to build long-term brand value by developing creative marketing programs, propriety flavors and distinctive packaging.
69891_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	During the past two years, we have introduced numerous new flavors or package sizes and have won many package design awards.
69891_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	We continue to develop products and package sizes designed to expand distribution in the higher-margin convenience store channel.
69891_13_ITEM1_P8_S4	We believe that the most dynamic validation of our strategy is our competitors efforts to replicate our creative business model.
69891_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Lifestyle Focus In recent years, we have honed our focus on developing healthier and functional beverages in response to a global shift in consumer buying habits.
69891_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	As health and wellness awareness grows, consumers are turning to drinks with reduced calories, wholesome ingredients and efficacy to meet their specific lifestyle needs.
69891_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	We are committed to tailoring the variety and types of beverages in our portfolio to satisfy changing preferences of an increasingly diverse mix of consumers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our wide variety of brands meets the demands of multiple consumer groups:
69891_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Established more than 120 years ago and distributed nationally, Shasta is recognized to be a bottling industry pioneer and innovator.
69891_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	As our largest volume brand, Shasta features multiple flavors, including products targeted to the growing Hispanic and other ethnic markets, and continues to earn consumer loyalty by delivering value, convenience and unique tastes such as California Dreamin , Very Cherry Twist and Fiesta Punch.
69891_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	More than 100 years old, Faygo products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include numerous unique flavors including RedPop, Moon Mist and Rock n Rye .
69891_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We also produce and market Ritz soft drinks and seltzers, primarily in the southeastern U.S., distribute Big Shot in New Orleans and surrounding areas, and offer St. Nick s soft drinks during the holiday season.
69891_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	With all natural ingredients, LaCroix has been outpacing the growing sparkling water segment that is fast becoming the alternative to the more typical carbonated soft drink.
69891_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Containing no calories, sodium or caffeine, LaCroix has the support of major national chains and is the top- selling canned sparkling water in the U.S. as well as the number one domestically-produced sparkling water.
69891_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	New themes of LaCroix with new packages and ingredient concepts are being designed and tested to be sold in new areas for the retailer not presently utilized for soft drinks.
69891_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Other products we deliver the health-conscious consumer include Clear Fruit , a clean, crisp, all natural non-carbonated beverage; and Crystal Bay , a zero-calorie combination of sparkling water and lively fruit flavors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Rip It energy fuel is available nationally in 19 flavors including five sugar-free and three non-carbonated varieties, and is a dominant player in the dollar-store channel.
69891_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Building on the success of Rip It, we offer two-ounce Rip It Shots in six flavors, including Tribute a new blend of active mandarin and live wild lime.
69891_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	For consumers seeking vitamin-enhanced hydration, we offer Mega Sport in four reinvigorating flavors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Everfresh , Home Juice and Mr. Pure 100% fresh juice and juice-added products and non-carbonated fruit drinks are available in over 30 flavors including Blueberry Pomegranate, Kiwi Strawberry and Pineapple Mango.
69891_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Originating in the Midwest over 50 years ago, these brands feature unique glass packaging targeted primarily for single-serve consumption.
69891_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our Ohana line of fruit drinks, lemonades and teas quenches thirst without carbonation.
69891_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	We have been successfully expanding to new geographic areas through both independent and Company-owned distribution facilities.
69891_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our twelve manufacturing facilities are strategically located near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States.
69891_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The locations of our plants enable us to efficiently manufacture and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including 22 of the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas.
69891_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Each manufacturing facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes.
69891_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	We utilize numerous package types and sizes, including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from seven ounces to three liters.
69891_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products.
69891_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions.
69891_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products.
69891_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can manufacture our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences.
69891_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations.
69891_13_ITEM1_P19_S4	These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
69891_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system.
69891_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods.
69891_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	These include development of products, packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
69891_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.
69891_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks.
69891_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	The emphasis of our sales and marketing programs is to maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty, typically through a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements, sponsorships and social media, along with consumer coupon distribution and product sampling.
69891_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	We retain advertising agencies to assist with media advertising programs for our brands.
69891_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives.
69891_13_ITEM1_P28_S3	These elements allow us to tailor our marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics.
69891_13_ITEM1_P28_S4	Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick s soft drink and special holiday flavors and packaging.
69891_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods.
69891_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our manufacturing facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby allowing us to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.
69891_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners, juice concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and ends, paper, cartons and closures.
69891_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame, stevia or Acesulfame-K. We manufacture a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities.
69891_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide market conditions.
69891_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_13_ITEM1_P31_S4	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_13_ITEM1_P31_S5	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	We have sufficient production capacity to meet seasonal increases without maintaining significant quantities of inventory in anticipation of periods of peak demand.
69891_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	Additionally, our sales can be influenced by weather conditions.
69891_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas.
69891_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong regional brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, specialized advertising and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
69891_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
69891_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers.
69891_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
69891_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
69891_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position.
69891_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
69891_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
69891_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	As of April 27, 2013, we employed approximately 1,200 people, of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
69891_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
69891_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	In addition, our Code of Ethics is available on our website.
69891_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in consumer preferences and taste.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers, which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health, wellness and/or functionality.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our inability to meet the demands of our larger customers could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard and fruit juice.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have considered imposing taxes on soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
69891_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher operating costs.
69891_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve manufacturing facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten manufacturing facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two manufacturing facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease office and warehouse space, transportation equipment, office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

69891_13_ITEM5_P4_S5	The net proceeds of $19.7 million were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facilities.

69891_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in "Item 8.
69891_13_ITEM6_P0_S2	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

69891_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	National Beverage Corp. is an acknowledged leader in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products.
69891_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our primary market focus is the United States, but our products are also distributed in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
69891_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	A holding company for various operating subsidiaries, National Beverage Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991.
69891_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.
69891_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our brands consist of (i) carbonated soft drinks in a variety of flavors as well as regular, diet and reduced-calorie options, and (ii) beverages geared toward the active and health-conscious consumer ( Power+ Brands ), including energy drinks and shots, juices, sparkling waters and enhanced beverages.
69891_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	In addition, we produce soft drinks for certain retailers ( Allied Brands ) that endorse the concept ( Strategic Alliance ) of having our brands and the Allied Brands marketed to produce the effect of enhanced growth of both.
69891_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our vertically-integrated manufacturing model unites the procurement of raw materials and production of concentrates with the manufacture of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as hundreds of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we have developed a hybrid distribution system that promotes and utilizes customers warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
69891_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We consider ourselves to be a leader in the development and sale of flavored beverage products.
69891_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our carbonated soft drink flavor development spans over 100 years originating with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo , and includes our Ritz and Big Shot brands along with St. Nick s holiday soft drinks.
69891_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	Our portfolio of products we refer to as Power+ Brands are targeted to consumers seeking healthier and functional alternatives to complement their active lifestyles, and include LaCroix , Crystal Bay and Clear Fruit flavored, sparkling and spring water products; Rip It energy drinks and shots; Mega Sport isotonic sports drinks; Everfresh , Home Juice and Mr. Pure 100% juice and juice-based products and Ohana fruit-flavored non-carbonated fruit drinks, lemonades and teas.
69891_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our strategy emphasizes the growth of our products by (i) offering a beverage portfolio of proprietary flavors with distinctive packaging and broad demographic appeal, (ii) supporting the franchise value of regional brands, (iii) appealing to the quality-value expectations of the family consumer, (iv) responding to demographic trends by developing innovative products designed to expand distribution in higher-margin channels, and (v) expanding our focus on healthier and functional beverages tailored toward healthy, active lifestyles.
69891_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable.
69891_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Additionally, our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, changes in consumer preference for beverage products, competitive pricing in the marketplace and weather conditions.
69891_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Net Sales Net sales for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2013 ( Fiscal 2013 ) increased 5.3% to $662.0 million as compared to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2012 ( Fiscal 2012 ).
69891_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	This sales improvement is due to case volume growth of our Power+ Brands of 5.4% and growth of carbonated soft drinks, which includes Allied Brands, of 6.4%.
69891_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Average net selling price per case decreased .8% primarily due to changes in product mix.
69891_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net sales for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2012 increased 4.8% to $628.9 million as compared to $600.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011 ( Fiscal 2011 ).
69891_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	This sales improvement is due to case volume growth of 9.9% for our Power+ Brands and 1.4% for carbonated soft drinks.
69891_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, our unit pricing increased 1.3% due to price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs.
69891_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Gross Profit Gross profit was 32.8% of net sales for Fiscal 2013, which represents a 1.1% margin decline compared to Fiscal 2012.
69891_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The gross margin decline is primarily due to product mix changes.
69891_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Cost of sales increased .8% on a per case basis.
69891_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gross profit was 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2012, which represents a 2.5% margin decline compared to Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	During Fiscal 2011, we benefited from sales of certain high margin products to overseas locations.
69891_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	These sales were impacted during Fiscal 2012 and, accordingly, gross margins returned to more normalized levels.
69891_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The gross margin decline is also due to higher raw material costs and changes in product mix.
69891_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Cost of sales increased 5.3% on a per case basis.
69891_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies.
69891_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	However, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $146.2 million or 22.1% of net sales for Fiscal 2013 compared to $146.2 million or 23.2% of net sales for Fiscal 2012.
69891_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Fiscal 2013 expenses reflect higher shipping and handling costs due to increased case volume, offset by reduced marketing and administrative expenses.
69891_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $146.2 million or 23.2% of net sales for Fiscal 2012 compared to $155.9 million or 26.0% of net sales for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decline in expenses is due to a decrease in marketing and administrative expenses.
69891_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Interest Expense and Other Expense - Net Interest expense is comprised of interest on borrowings and fees related to maintaining lines of credit.
69891_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company paid a special cash dividend of $118.1 million ($2.55 per common share) on December 27, 2012 from available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, interest expense increased to $403,000 in Fiscal 2013 from $107,000 in Fiscal 2012 and $99,000 in Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	Other expense is net of interest income of $37,000 for Fiscal 2013, $69,000 for Fiscal 2012 and $140,000 for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	The decline in interest income for Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 is due to lower average invested balances and investment yields.
69891_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was approximately 33.4% for Fiscal 2013, 34.2% for Fiscal 2012 and 34.9% for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and the manufacturing deduction.
69891_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	At April 27, 2013, we maintained $100 million unsecured revolving credit facilities, of which $50 million of borrowings were outstanding and $2.3 million was used for standby letters of credit.
69891_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We believe that existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the next twelve months.

69891_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We continually evaluate capital projects to expand our production capacity, enhance packaging capabilities or improve efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Expenditures for property, plant and equipment amounted to $9.7 million for Fiscal 2013.
69891_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	There were no material capital expenditure commitments at April 27, 2013.

69891_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company paid special cash dividends on common stock of $118.1 million ($2.55 per share) on December 27, 2012, $106.3 million ($2.30 per share) on February 14, 2011 and $62.3 million ($1.35 per share) on January 22, 2010.
69891_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Pursuant to a management agreement, we incurred a fee to Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ) of approximately $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013, $6.3 million for Fiscal 2012 and $6.0 million for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	At April 27, 2013, management fees payable to CMA were $3.1 million.
69891_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Cash Flows Cash flow was significantly impacted during Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2011 by the payment of two special cash dividends aggregating $224.5 million.
69891_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	During Fiscal 2013, $40.3 million was provided by operating activities, which was offset by $9.6 million used in investing activities and $48.0 million used in financing activities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Cash provided by operating activities increased $2.6 million primarily due to increased earnings.
69891_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Cash used in financing activities increased $48.4 million due to the special dividend payment of $118.1 million in Fiscal 2013, partially offset by $19.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of Special Series D Preferred Stock and $50.0 million in net borrowings under credit facilities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	During Fiscal 2012, $37.7 million was provided by operating activities, which was offset by $9.9 million used in investing activities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Cash provided by operating activities decreased $17.6 million primarily due to increases in trade receivables and inventories as well as a decline in accrued liabilities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Cash used in investing activities decreased $1.5 million due to lower capital expenditures.
69891_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Financial Position During Fiscal 2013, our working capital decreased $2.3 million to $67.5 million due to a decline in cash resulting from the payment of the special cash dividend.
69891_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Trade receivables increased $2.5 million, which represents an increase in days sales outstanding from approximately 33.9 days to 34.7 days, and inventories decreased $1.6 million, which represents an improvement in annual inventory turns from 11.0 to 11.2 times.
69891_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	Accounts payable decreased $10.6 million due to the timing of payments to vendors at the end of the year.
69891_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	At April 27, 2013, the current ratio was 2.1 to 1, as compared to 1.9 to 1 at April 28, 2012.
69891_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	During Fiscal 2012, our working capital increased $38.9 million to $69.8 million due to cash provided by operating activities.
69891_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Trade receivables increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase in days sales outstanding from approximately 33.4 days to 33.9 days, and inventories increased $7.5 million, which represents a reduction in annual inventory turns from 11.7 to 11 times.
69891_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	These increases are primarily due to the commencement of a new Strategic Alliance agreement in the latter part of Fiscal 2012.
69891_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	The increase in inventory is also due to higher raw material costs and quantity increases related to anticipated sales growth.
69891_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	Prepaid and other assets decreased $4.0 million due to a decline in the fair value of derivative assets.
69891_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	At April 28, 2012, the current ratio was 1.9 to 1, as compared to 1.4 to 1 at April 30, 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Contractual obligations at April 27, 2013 are payable as follows:
69891_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	As of April 27, 2013, we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $5.9 million.
69891_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates July 31, 2013, the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount.
69891_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee.
69891_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan.
69891_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Total contributions were $2.6 million for Fiscal 2013, $2.5 million for Fiscal 2012 and $2.5 million for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for the specific periods indicated in the table above.
69891_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.3 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs.
69891_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	These standby letters of credit expire through June 2014 and are expected to be renewed.
69891_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Credit Risk We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	In those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	When the incentive is paid in arrears, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
69891_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success in acquiring other beverage businesses, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies, ability to pass along cost increases to our customers, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unseasonably cold or wet weather conditions and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders.
69891_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodities We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest Rates At April 27, 2013, the Company had $50 million in borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 1.1%.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Interest rate hedging products are not currently used to mitigate risk from interest fluctuations.
69891_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If the interest rate on our debt changed by 100 basis points (1%), our interest expense for Fiscal 2013 would have changed by approximately $200,000.
69891_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

69891_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and sells a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products primarily in North America.
69891_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries.
69891_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	When used in this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.
69891_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries.
69891_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
69891_13_ITEM8_P7_S3	Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and, as a result, an additional week is added every five or six years.
69891_13_ITEM8_P7_S4	Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 consisted of 52 weeks.
69891_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid securities (consisting primarily of short-term money-market investments) with an original maturity of three months or less.
69891_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_13_ITEM8_P9_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options, which amounted to 172,000 shares in Fiscal 2013, 181,000 shares in Fiscal 2012 and 185,000 shares in Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	Options to purchase 291,000 shares in Fiscal 2011 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were anti-dilutive.
69891_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The fair values of our cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
69891_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	The fair value of our long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty.
69891_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	The estimated fair values of our derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_13_ITEM8_P11_S3	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets as of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks.
69891_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.
69891_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	Inventories at April 27, 2013 were comprised of finished goods of $23.2 million and raw materials of $16.0 million.
69891_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	Inventories at April 28, 2012 were comprised of finished goods of $24.4 million and raw materials of $16.5 million.
69891_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Marketing Costs We are involved in a variety of marketing programs, including cooperative advertising programs with customers, to advertise and promote our products to consumers.
69891_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	Marketing costs are expensed when incurred, except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place.
69891_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	Marketing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $44.6 million in Fiscal 2013, $45.8 million in Fiscal 2012 and $52.9 million in Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements, and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	In those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	When the incentive is paid in arrears, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_13_ITEM8_P24_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of income.
69891_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	Such costs aggregated $44.2 million in Fiscal 2013, $41.8 million in Fiscal 2012 and $41.3 million in Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P26_S2	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Trade Receivables We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
69891_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	As of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.
69891_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Property, plant and equipment as of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012 consisted of the following:
69891_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Depreciation expense was $9.0 million for Fiscal 2013, $8.5 million for Fiscal 2012 and $9.3 million for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Accrued liabilities as of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012 consisted of the following:
69891_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	At April 27, 2013, a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $100 million (the Credit Facilities ).
69891_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Credit Facilities expire from November 22, 2015 to April 30, 2016 and current borrowings bear interest at .9% above one-month LIBOR (1.1% at April 27, 2013).
69891_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	At April 27, 2013, borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities were $50 million, $2.3 million of the Credit Facilities were used for standby letters of credit and $47.7 million were available for borrowings.
69891_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, principally debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities), and contain other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.

69891_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly.
69891_13_ITEM8_P38_S3	Unpaid dividends at April 27, 2013 were $141,000.
69891_13_ITEM8_P38_S4	The Series D Preferred is nonvoting and is redeemable at the option of the Company beginning May 1, 2014 at $50 per share.
69891_13_ITEM8_P38_S5	The net proceeds of $19.7 million were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facilities.
69891_13_ITEM8_P38_S6	In addition, the Company has 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, which are held as treasury stock and, therefore, such shares have no liquidation value.
69891_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	In April 2012, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company s Stock Buyback Program from 800,000 to 1.6 million shares of common stock.

69891_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.
69891_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and, while shareholder value has increased over 2,000% since the inception of this agreement, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013, $6.3 million for Fiscal 2012 and $6.0 million for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $3.1 million at April 27, 2013 and $3.0 million at April 28, 2012.
69891_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	We have entered into various aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans through April 2014.
69891_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	The financial instruments were designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011:
69891_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	As of April 27, 2013, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $21.0 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $964,000 of unrealized net loss (before tax) will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next twelve months.
69891_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	As of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012, the fair value of the derivative liability was $964,000 and $503,000, respectively, which was included in accrued liabilities.
69891_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Other expense (income) consisted of the following:
69891_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012 consisted of the following:
69891_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	As of April 27, 2013, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $4.3 million, of which $126,000 was recognized as tax benefit in Fiscal 2013.
69891_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $3.5 million.
69891_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	As of April 27, 2013, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $514,000, of which approximately $26,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2013.
69891_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_13_ITEM8_P58_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2009 are subject to examination.
69891_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2009.
69891_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the stockholders.
69891_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan ) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above.
69891_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_13_ITEM8_P64_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	Stock options granted were 2,000 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2013, 3,000 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2012 and 301,500 shares in Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P66_S3	The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 8 years for Fiscal 2013, 8 years for Fiscal 2012 and 7.5 years for Fiscal 2011; weighted average expected volatility of 38.1% for Fiscal 2013, 42.9% for Fiscal 2012 and 48.6% for Fiscal 2011; weighted average risk free interest rates of 1.6% for Fiscal 2013, 2.5% for Fiscal 2012 and 2.8% for Fiscal 2011; and expected dividend yield of 5.0% for Fiscal 2013, 5.3% for Fiscal 2012 and 4.3% for Fiscal 2011.
69891_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_13_ITEM8_P67_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_13_ITEM8_P67_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.

69891_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	Under the Pension Protection Act ( PPA ), if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
69891_13_ITEM8_P74_S2	If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multi-employer plan, the Company could be required to pay the plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.

69891_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under various non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through 2023.
69891_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	Certain of these leases contain scheduled rent increases and/or renewal options.
69891_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

69891_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of National Beverage Corp.
69891_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Beverage Corp. as of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 27, 2013.
69891_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	We also have audited National Beverage Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of April 27, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
69891_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_13_ITEM8_P86_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_13_ITEM8_P86_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_13_ITEM8_P86_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of April 27, 2013 and April 28, 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 27, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 27, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
69891_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
69891_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 27, 2013.
69891_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.

69891_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our brands consist of (i) beverages geared toward the active and health-conscious consumer ( Power+ Brands ), including energy drinks and shots, juices, sparkling waters and enhanced beverages, and (ii) Carbonated Soft Drinks in a variety of flavors as well as regular, diet and reduced-calorie options.
69891_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition, we produce soft drinks for certain retailers ( Allied Brands ) that endorse the Strategic Alliance concept of having our brands and Allied Brands marketed to effectuate enhanced growth of both.
69891_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our manufacturing model integrates the procurement of raw materials and production of concentrates with the manufacture of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities.
69891_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as thousands of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we have developed a hybrid distribution system that promotes and utilizes customer warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the combination of our business strategies and philosophies is key to giving us a greater competitive advantage and differentiating us from our competitors.
69891_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Lifestyle Focus We focus on developing healthier and functional beverages in response to a global shift in consumer buying habits.
69891_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	As health and wellness awareness grows, consumers are turning to drinks with reduced calories, wholesome ingredients and efficacy to meet their specific lifestyle needs.

69891_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Fantasy of Flavors Throughout our product lines, we emphasize distinctly flavored beverages.
69891_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Although cola drinks account for approximately 50% of the soft drink industry s domestic grocery channel volume, colas account for less than 20% of our total volume.
69891_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	In the higher margin convenience store channel, flavors represent 54% of soft drink sales and are outpacing colas.
69891_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our flavor development spans 125 years and originated with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo , each of which offers more than 30 flavor varieties.
69891_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Regional Share Dynamics This is our term for the philosophy we employ for the development and support of our brands that have significant regional presence.
69891_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Because we tailor our marketing and promotion programs by locale, we believe many of our brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to competitive substitution.
69891_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	In addition, home-town products often generate more aggressive retailer sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising.
69891_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that consumers demand value as the purchase default option in volatile economic times, and we are intent on producing and developing products of the highest quality that appeal to the value expectations of the family consumer.

69891_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Creative Agility In a beverage industry that is dominated by the cola giants , we pride ourselves on our ability to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than many of our competitors who are burdened by distribution complexity and legacy costs.
69891_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	We strive to build long-term brand value by developing creative marketing programs, propriety flavors and distinctive packaging.
69891_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	In recent years, we have introduced numerous new flavors or package sizes and have won many package design awards.
69891_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	We continue to develop products and package sizes designed to expand distribution.
69891_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	We believe that the most dynamic validation of our strategy is our competitors efforts to replicate our creative business model.
69891_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The National Beverage Corp. brand portfolio contains a wide variety of beverages to meet consumer needs in a multitude of market segments.
69891_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	National Beverage employs its flavor expertise with beverage offerings including, but not limited to, the following non-alcoholic beverage segments:

69891_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	During recent years, we reformulated many of our brands to reduce the caloric content while still preserving their time tested flavor profiles.
69891_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our Brands, optically and content-wise, are always a work in process.
69891_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	As often as innovation develops, we endeavor to significantly improve them, striving for quality and authenticity over cost.
69891_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our twelve manufacturing facilities are strategically located near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States.
69891_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	The locations of our plants enable us to efficiently manufacture and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including 22 of the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas.
69891_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Each manufacturing facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes.
69891_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	We utilize numerous package types and sizes, including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from ten ounces to three liters.
69891_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products.
69891_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions.
69891_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products.
69891_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can manufacture our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences.
69891_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations.
69891_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.
69891_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
69891_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system.
69891_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods.
69891_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	These include development of products, packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
69891_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.
69891_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks.
69891_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The emphasis of our sales and marketing programs is to maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty, typically through a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements, sponsorships and social media, along with consumer coupon distribution and product sampling.
69891_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	We retain advertising agencies to assist with media advertising programs for our brands.
69891_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives.
69891_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	These elements allow us to tailor our marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics.
69891_14_ITEM1_P32_S4	Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick s soft drink and special holiday flavors and packaging.
69891_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods.
69891_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our manufacturing facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.
69891_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners, juice concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and ends, paper, cartons and closures.
69891_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame, stevia or Acesulfame-K. We manufacture a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities.
69891_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions.
69891_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_14_ITEM1_P35_S4	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_14_ITEM1_P35_S5	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We have sufficient production capacity to meet seasonal increases without maintaining significant quantities of inventory in anticipation of periods of peak demand.
69891_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	Additionally, our sales can be influenced by weather conditions.
69891_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas.
69891_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong regional brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, specialized advertising and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
69891_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
69891_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers.
69891_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
69891_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
69891_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position.
69891_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
69891_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
69891_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	As of May 3, 2014, we employed approximately 1,200 people, of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
69891_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
69891_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	In addition, our Code of Ethics is available on our website.
69891_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in consumer preferences and taste.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers, which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health, wellness and/or functionality.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our inability to meet the demands of our larger customers could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard and fruit juice.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have considered limiting the consumption of and imposing additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our profitability is affected by the cost of medical and retirement benefits provided to employees.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of certain factors beyond our control.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Although we seek to limit these cost increases, continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods.
69891_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute products.
69891_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve manufacturing facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten manufacturing facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two manufacturing facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease office and warehouse space, transportation equipment, office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

69891_14_ITEM5_P4_S5	The net proceeds of $19.7 million were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facilities.

69891_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	In addition, we produce soft drinks for certain retailers ( Allied Brands ) that endorse the Strategic Alliance concept of having our brands and Allied Brands marketed to effectuate enhanced growth of both.
69891_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our manufacturing model integrates the procurement of raw materials and production of concentrates with the manufacture of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities.
69891_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as thousands of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we have developed a hybrid distribution system that promotes and utilizes customer warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
69891_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	We consider ourselves to be a leader in the development and sale of flavored beverage products.
69891_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The National Beverage Corp. brand portfolio contains a wide variety of beverages to meet consumer needs in a multitude of markets segments.

69891_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable.
69891_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Additionally, our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, changes in consumer preference for beverage products, competitive pricing in the marketplace and weather conditions.
69891_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net Sales Net sales for the fiscal year ended May 3, 2014 ( Fiscal 2014 ) decreased 3.2% to $641.1 million as compared to $662.0 million for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2013 ( Fiscal 2013 ).
69891_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The lower sales resulted from a 7.5% volume decline in Carbonated Soft Drinks, principally due to extended periods of unfavorable weather conditions and industry-wide consumption decline.
69891_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	This volume decline was partially offset by case volume growth of 8.2% for our Power+ Brands.
69891_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	Average net selling price per case was approximately the same for both years.
69891_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net sales for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2013 increased 5.3% to $662.0 million as compared to $628.9 million for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2012 ( Fiscal 2012 ).
69891_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	This sales improvement is due to case volume growth of our Power+ Brands of 5.4% and growth of Carbonated Soft Drinks, which includes Allied Brands, of 6.4%.
69891_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Average net selling price per case decreased .8% primarily due to changes in product mix.
69891_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Gross Profit Gross profit was 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014, which represents a 1.1% margin improvement compared to Fiscal 2013.
69891_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The gross margin improvement is primarily due to favorable product mix changes and lower raw material costs.
69891_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Cost of sales decreased 1.7% on a per case basis.
69891_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross profit was 32.8% of net sales for Fiscal 2013, which represents a 1.1% margin decline compared to Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The gross margin decline is primarily due to product mix changes.
69891_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Cost of sales increased .8% on a per case basis.
69891_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies.
69891_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	However, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $153.2 million or 23.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014 compared to $146.2 million or 22.1% of net sales for Fiscal 2013.
69891_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Fiscal 2014 expenses reflect higher selling and marketing costs, primarily due to increased advertising expenses.
69891_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $146.2 million or 22.1% of net sales for Fiscal 2013 compared to $146.2 million or 23.2% of net sales for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Fiscal 2013 expenses reflect higher shipping and handling costs due to increased case volume, offset by reduced marketing and administrative expenses.
69891_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Interest Expense and Other Expense - Net Interest expense is comprised of interest on borrowings and fees related to maintaining lines of credit.
69891_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company paid a special cash dividend of $118.1 million ($2.55 per common share) on December 27, 2012 from available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities.

69891_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Other expense is net of interest income of $15,000 for Fiscal 2014, $37,000 for Fiscal 2013 and $69,000 for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	The decline in interest income for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 is due to lower average invested balances.
69891_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate would have been approximately 34%* for Fiscal 2014, compared with 33.4% for Fiscal 2013 and 34.2% for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, the manufacturing deduction; and for Fiscal 2014, adjustment of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of certain open tax years, which resulted in a 30.9% tax rate.
69891_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	*See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities.

69891_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Cash used in financing activities increased $48.4 million due to the special dividend payment of $118.1 million in Fiscal 2013, partially offset by $19.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Series D Preferred and $50.0 million in net borrowings under credit facilities.
69891_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Financial Position During Fiscal 2014, our working capital increased $11.1 million to $78.6 million primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.
69891_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Trade receivables decreased $5.9 million due to lower sales activity as days sales outstanding remain unchanged at 34.7 days.
69891_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Inventories increased $4.7 million primarily due to higher quantities related to new products and to support more frequent customer promotions.
69891_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	At May 3, 2014, the current ratio was 2.2 to 1 as compared to 2.1 to 1 at April 27, 2013.
69891_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	During Fiscal 2013, our working capital decreased $2.3 million to $67.5 million due to a decline in cash resulting from the payment of the special cash dividend.
69891_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Trade receivables increased $2.5 million, which represents an increase in days sales outstanding from approximately 33.9 days to 34.7 days, and inventories decreased $1.6 million, which represents an improvement in annual inventory turns from 11.0 to 11.2 times.
69891_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Accounts payable decreased $10.6 million due to the timing of payments to vendors at the end of the fiscal year.
69891_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	At April 27, 2013, the current ratio was 2.1 to 1 as compared to 1.9 to 1 at April 28, 2012.
69891_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Contractual obligations at May 3, 2014 are payable as follows:
69891_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of May 3, 2014, we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $5.3 million.
69891_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates July 31, 2014, the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount.
69891_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee.
69891_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan.
69891_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Total contributions were $2.7 million for Fiscal 2014, $2.6 million for Fiscal 2013 and $2.5 million for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for the specific periods indicated in the table above.
69891_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.2 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs.
69891_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	These standby letters of credit expire through June 2015 and are expected to be renewed.
69891_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Credit Risk We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
69891_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success in acquiring other beverage businesses, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies, ability to pass along cost increases to our customers, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unseasonably cold or wet weather conditions and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders.
69891_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodities We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest Rates At May 3, 2014, the Company had $30 million in borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 1.1%.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Interest rate hedging products are not currently used to mitigate risk from interest fluctuations.
69891_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If the interest rate on our debt changed by 100 basis points (1%), our interest expense for Fiscal 2014 would have changed by approximately $400,000.
69891_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

69891_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and sells a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products primarily in North America.
69891_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries.
69891_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	When used in this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.
69891_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries.
69891_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
69891_14_ITEM8_P7_S3	Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and, as a result, an additional week is added every five or six years.
69891_14_ITEM8_P7_S4	Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks while Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 consisted of 52 weeks.
69891_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid securities (consisting primarily of short-term money-market investments) with an original maturity of three months or less.
69891_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in raw material costs.
69891_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_14_ITEM8_P9_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 188,000 shares in Fiscal 2014, 172,000 shares in Fiscal 2013 and 181,000 shares in Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty.
69891_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the best information available.
69891_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets as of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks.
69891_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.
69891_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	Inventories at May 3, 2014 were comprised of finished goods of $27.2 million and raw materials of $16.7 million.
69891_14_ITEM8_P18_S2	Inventories at April 27, 2013 were comprised of finished goods of $23.2 million and raw materials of $16.0 million.
69891_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Marketing Costs We are involved in a variety of marketing programs, including cooperative advertising programs with customers, to advertise and promote our products to consumers.
69891_14_ITEM8_P19_S1	Marketing costs are expensed when incurred, except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place.
69891_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	Marketing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $50.2 million in Fiscal 2014, $44.6 million in Fiscal 2013 and $45.8 million in Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
69891_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.
69891_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	ASU 2014-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30, 2017.
69891_14_ITEM8_P20_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_14_ITEM8_P21_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_14_ITEM8_P25_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
69891_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Such costs aggregated $44.4 million in Fiscal 2014, $44.2 million in Fiscal 2013 and $41.8 million in Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Trade Receivables We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_14_ITEM8_P31_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
69891_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	As of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.
69891_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Property, plant and equipment as of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 consisted of the following:
69891_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Depreciation expense was $9.8 million for Fiscal 2014, $9.0 million for Fiscal 2013 and $8.5 million for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Accrued liabilities as of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 consisted of the following:
69891_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	At May 3, 2014, a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $100 million (the Credit Facilities ).
69891_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Credit Facilities expire from November 22, 2015 to April 30, 2016 and current borrowings bear interest at .9% above one-month LIBOR (1.1% at May 3, 2014).
69891_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities were $30 million at May 3, 2014 and $50 million at April 27, 2013.
69891_14_ITEM8_P37_S3	At May 3, 2014, $2.2 million of the Credit Facilities were used for standby letters of credit and $67.8 million were available for borrowings.
69891_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, principally debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities), and contain other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.
69891_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	At May 3, 2014, we were in compliance with all loan covenants.
69891_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company paid special cash dividends on common stock of $118.1 million ($2.55 per share) on December 27, 2012, $106.3 million ($2.30 per share) on February 14, 2011 and $62.3 million ($1.35 per share) on January 22, 2010.
69891_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	On January 25, 2013, the Company sold 400,000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share ( Series D Preferred ) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million.
69891_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Series D Preferred has a liquidation preference of $50 per share and accrues dividends on this amount at an annual rate of 3% through April 30, 2014 and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to 370 basis points above the 3-Month LIBOR.
69891_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly.
69891_14_ITEM8_P40_S3	Accrued dividends at May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 were $90,000 and $141,000, respectively.
69891_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Series D Preferred is nonvoting and redeemable at the option of the Company beginning May 1, 2014 at $50 per share.
69891_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	The net proceeds of $19.7 million were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facilities.
69891_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	In addition, the Company has 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, which are held as treasury stock and, therefore, such shares have no liquidation value.
69891_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	On May 2, 2014, the Company redeemed 160,000 shares of Series D Preferred, representing 40% of the amount outstanding, for an aggregate price of $8 million plus accrued dividends.
69891_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	In connection therewith, the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $118,000 of original issuance costs, which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation.
69891_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	In conjunction with the partial redemption, the annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred was reduced to 2.5% for the twelve month period beginning May 1, 2014.
69891_14_ITEM8_P42_S3	In evaluating the impact of the rate change, the Company determined that the related fair value change was immaterial and that no adjustment was required.
69891_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	In April 2012, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company s Stock Buyback Program from 800,000 to 1.6 million shares of common stock.
69891_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	As of May 3, 2014, 502,060 shares were purchased under the program and 1,097,940 shares were available for purchase.
69891_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	There were no shares purchased during the last three fiscal years.
69891_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.
69891_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and, while shareholder value has increased over 2,000% since the inception of this agreement, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014, $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013 and $6.3 million for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $1.6 million at May 3, 2014 and $3.1 million at April 27, 2013.
69891_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	From time to time, we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans.
69891_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012:
69891_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	As of May 3, 2014, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $2.3 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $5,000 of unrealized gain before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next month.
69891_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	As of May 3, 2014, the fair value of the derivative asset was $5,000, which was included in prepaid and other assets.
69891_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	As of April 27, 2013, the fair value of the derivative liability was $964,000, which was included in accrued liabilities.
69891_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 consisted of the following:
69891_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	* During April 2014, the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its review of the Company s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013.
69891_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	No material adjustments were proposed and, accordingly, the Company adjusted the related unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014.
69891_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	As of May 3, 2014, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 million and $2.1 million was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2014.
69891_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.4 million.
69891_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Includes $1,907 related to the Internal Revenue Service review of the Company s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013 noted above.
69891_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	As of May 3, 2014, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $351,000, of which approximately $163,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2014.
69891_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_14_ITEM8_P62_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_14_ITEM8_P62_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2013 are subject to examination.
69891_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2009.
69891_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the stockholders.
69891_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan ) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above.
69891_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_14_ITEM8_P68_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Stock options granted were 5,245 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2014, 2,000 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2013 and 3,000 KEEP shares in Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 8 years for Fiscal 2014, 8 years for Fiscal 2013 and 8 years for Fiscal 2012; weighted average expected volatility of 35.8% for Fiscal 2014, 38.1% for Fiscal 2013 and 42.9% for Fiscal 2012; weighted average risk free interest rates of 1.9% for Fiscal 2014, 1.6% for Fiscal 2013 and 2.5% for Fiscal 2012; and expected dividend yield of 4.6% for Fiscal 2014, 5.0% for Fiscal 2013 and 5.3% for Fiscal 2012.
69891_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_14_ITEM8_P71_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.

69891_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

69891_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of National Beverage Corp.
69891_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Beverage Corp. as of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 3, 2014.
69891_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	We also have audited National Beverage Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of May 3, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 1992.
69891_14_ITEM8_P90_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_14_ITEM8_P90_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_14_ITEM8_P91_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_14_ITEM8_P91_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_14_ITEM8_P91_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_14_ITEM8_P91_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_14_ITEM8_P91_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of May 3, 2014 and April 27, 2013 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 3, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 3, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 1992.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 3, 2014.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
69891_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	McGladrey LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

69891_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our primary market focus is the United States, but our products are also distributed in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, Asia, and Europe.
69891_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	A holding company for various operating subsidiaries, National Beverage Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991.
69891_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.
69891_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our brands consist of (i) beverages geared toward the active and health-conscious consumer ( Power+ Brands ), including sparkling waters, energy drinks and shots, juices, and enhanced beverages, and (ii) Carbonated Soft Drinks in a variety of flavors including regular, sugar-free and reduced-calorie options.
69891_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition, we produce soft drinks for certain retailers ( Allied Brands ) that endorse the Strategic Alliance concept of having our brands and Allied Brands marketed to effectuate enhanced growth of both.
69891_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our manufacturing model integrates the procurement of raw materials and production of concentrates with the manufacture of finished products in our twelve manufacturing facilities.
69891_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers as well as thousands of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we have developed a hybrid distribution system that promotes and utilizes customer warehouse distribution facilities and our own direct-store delivery fleet plus the direct-store delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the combination of our business strategies and philosophies is key to giving us a greater competitive advantage and differentiating us from our competitors.
69891_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	These points of differentiation include the following:
69891_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Lifestyle Focus We focus on developing healthier and functional beverages in response to a global shift in consumer buying habits.
69891_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	As health and wellness awareness grows, consumers are turning to drinks with reduced calories, wholesome ingredients and efficacy to meet their specific lifestyle needs.
69891_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are committed to tailoring the variety and types of beverages in our portfolio to satisfy changing preferences of an increasingly diverse mix of crossover consumers a growing group who desire a change from Carbonated Soft Drinks and other artificially flavored, artificially sweetened beverages.
69891_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Fantasy of Flavors Throughout our product lines, we emphasize distinctly flavored beverages.
69891_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Although cola drinks account for approximately 49% of the soft drink industry s domestic grocery channel volume, colas account for less than 20% of our total volume.
69891_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the higher margin convenience store channel, flavors represent 55% of soft drink sales and are outpacing colas.
69891_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our flavor development spans more than 125 years and originated with our flagship brands, Shasta and Faygo , each of which offers more than 30 flavor varieties.
69891_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Regional Share Dynamics This is our term for the philosophy we employ for the development and support of our brands that have significant regional presence.
69891_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Because we tailor our marketing and promotion programs by locale, we believe many of our brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to competitive substitution.
69891_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition, home-town products often generate more aggressive retailer sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising.
69891_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe that consumers demand value as the purchase default option in volatile economic times, and we are intent on producing and developing products of the highest quality that appeal to the value expectations of the family consumer.
69891_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	We believe we can leverage our cost-effective manufacturing and distribution systems, and our efficient regionally focused marketing programs, to profitably deliver products to the consumer at a lower price-point than our national competitors.
69891_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Creative Agility In a beverage industry that is dominated by the cola giants , we pride ourselves on our ability to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than many of our competitors who are burdened by distribution complexity and legacy costs.
69891_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	We strive to build long-term brand value by developing creative marketing programs, propriety flavors and distinctive packaging.
69891_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	In recent years, we have introduced numerous new flavors or package sizes and have won many package design awards.
69891_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	We continue to develop products and package sizes designed to expand distribution.
69891_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	We believe that the most dynamic validation of our strategy is our competitors efforts to replicate our creative business model.
69891_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	The National Beverage Corp. brand portfolio contains a wide variety of beverages to meet consumer needs in a multitude of market segments.
69891_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	National Beverage employs its flavor expertise with beverage offerings including, but not limited to, the following non-alcoholic beverage segments:
69891_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	La Croix 100% all natural LaCroix Sparkling Water is setting the pace in the Sparkling Water category that is fast becoming the alternative to traditional carbonated soda.

69891_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	naturally refresh in tall 12 oz.
69891_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Brilliant graphics, robust aroma, naturally essenced and premium-priced, C rate is a trendsetting addition to a brand that is the healthy alternative for trend-forward consumers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	NiCola by LaCroix, a new innovative sparkling water with the essence and flavor of cola, is innocent of calories, sodium, sweetener or any ingredient that the health-conscious consumer avoids.
69891_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Since its initial Chicago launch in October 2014, NiCola has received positive response from cola and diet cola drinkers looking to crossover to a beverage that complements a healthier lifestyle.
69891_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Additional LaCroix themes are in development and feature unique packaging, ground-breaking flavor concepts, and a go-to-market strategy designed to provide additional placements within the retail environment outside the traditional grocery shelf.
69891_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Rip It Rip It energy fuel is the flavor innovator in the growing energy category with 14 unique flavors including six sugar free, bringing variety and value to the widening consumer base.
69891_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Rip It Tribute themed energy is a successful military inspired addition to the lineup with the latest addition Tribute CYP-X Orange Cr me.
69891_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	Building on the flavor tradition of original Rip It, a 2 oz. sugar free shot version with seven flavors is marketed through our distribution system in multiple displayable package configurations.
69891_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Everfresh 100% juice and juice drinks are available in more than 35 flavors, from such classics as Orange, Cranberry and flavored lemonades to exotics that include Premium Papaya and Pineapple Mango.
69891_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Originating in the Midwest, the Everfresh signature package is a hot-filled, 16 oz. glass bottle primarily for single-serve consumption.
69891_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Additional consumer - friendly packages range from 10 oz.
69891_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Everfresh Premier Varietals , a unique theme from Everfresh, is positioned as a stand-alone brand for display in the produce section of supermarkets.
69891_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Everfresh Premier Varietals is a premium line of 100% natural apple juice from a variety of apples specific to the taste of the varietal, such as Granny Smith, McIntosh, Honey Crisp, Golden Delicious, Fuji and Pink Lady.
69891_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Premier Varietals are packaged in award-winning 12 oz.
69891_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	glass bottles with decorative tamper-evident neck seals.
69891_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	More than 125 years old and distributed nationally, Shasta is recognized as a bottling industry pioneer and innovator.
69891_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	As our largest volume brand, Shasta features multiple flavors, including products targeted to the growing Hispanic and other ethnic markets, and continues to earn consumer loyalty by delivering value, convenience and such unique tastes as California Dreamin , Very Cherry Twist and Fiesta Punch.
69891_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	Honoring its origin as a sparkling water company, Shasta will soon introduce a new theme featuring Shasta s classic flavors in an unsweetened, zero-calorie, refreshing sparkling water concept.
69891_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	More than 100 years old, Faygo products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include numerous unique flavors including RedPop , Moon Mist , and Rock n Rye .
69891_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	We also produce and market Ritz soft drinks and seltzers, primarily in the southeastern U.S., distribute Big Shot in New Orleans and surrounding areas, and offer St. Nick s soft drinks during the holiday season.
69891_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	During recent years, we reformulated many of our brands to reduce the caloric content while still preserving their time-tested flavor profiles.
69891_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Brands, optically and content-wise, are always a work in process.
69891_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	As often as innovation develops, we endeavor to significantly improve them, striving for quality and authenticity over cost.
69891_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our twelve manufacturing facilities are strategically located near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States.
69891_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The locations of our plants enable us to efficiently manufacture and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including all of the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas.
69891_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Each manufacturing facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes.
69891_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	We utilize numerous package types and sizes, including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from ten ounces to three liters.
69891_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products.
69891_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions.
69891_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products.
69891_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can manufacture our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences.
69891_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations.
69891_15_ITEM1_P25_S4	These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.
69891_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
69891_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system.
69891_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods.
69891_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	These include development of products, packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
69891_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.
69891_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks.
69891_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The emphasis of our sales and marketing programs is to maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty, typically through a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements, sponsorships and social media, along with consumer coupon distribution and product sampling.
69891_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	We retain advertising agencies to assist with media advertising programs for our brands.
69891_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives.
69891_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	These elements allow us to tailor our marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics.
69891_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick s soft drink and special holiday flavors and packaging.
69891_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods.
69891_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our manufacturing facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.
69891_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners, juice concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and ends, paper, cartons and closures.
69891_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame, stevia or acesulfame potassium.
69891_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	We manufacture a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities.
69891_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions.
69891_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_15_ITEM1_P37_S4	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_15_ITEM1_P37_S5	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer months.
69891_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have sufficient production capacity to meet seasonal increases without maintaining significant quantities of inventory in anticipation of periods of peak demand.
69891_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	Additionally, our sales can be influenced by weather conditions.
69891_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas.
69891_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong regional brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, specialized advertising and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.

69891_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Certain states and localities prohibit the sale of certain beverages unless a deposit or tax is charged for containers.
69891_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

69891_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

69891_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in consumer preferences and taste.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers, which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health, wellness and/or functionality.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our inability to meet the demands of our larger customers could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard, water and fruit juice.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have considered limiting the consumption of and imposing additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our profitability is affected by the cost of medical and retirement benefits provided to employees.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of certain factors beyond our control.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Although we seek to limit these cost increases, continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute products.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are dependent on key personnel .
69891_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
69891_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected.
69891_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve manufacturing facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten manufacturing facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two manufacturing facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease office and warehouse space, transportation equipment, office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

69891_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The higher sales resulted from a 1.1% increase in case volume partially offset by a .4% decline in average selling price per unit.
69891_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	The increase in case volume reflects a 2.9% increase in branded volume, including a 15.3% case volume growth for our Power+ Brands, partially offset by a decline in Allied Brands.
69891_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The decline in selling price per unit is related to changes in product mix.

69891_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The lower sales resulted from a 7.5% volume decline in Carbonated Soft Drinks, principally due to extended periods of unfavorable weather conditions and industry-wide consumption decline.
69891_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	This volume decline was partially offset by case volume growth of 8.2% for our Power+ Brands.
69891_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Average net selling price per case was approximately the same for both years.
69891_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Gross Profit Gross profit approximated 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.

69891_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Gross profit was 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014, which represents a 1.1% margin improvement compared to Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The gross margin improvement is primarily due to favorable product mix changes and lower raw material costs.
69891_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Cost of sales decreased 1.7% on a per case basis.
69891_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies.

69891_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	The change in interest income for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 is due to changes in average invested balances.

69891_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, the manufacturing deduction and, for Fiscal 2014, adjustment of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of certain open tax years.

69891_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	Cash used in financing activities was $28.7 million reflecting an $8 million redemption of preferred stock and $20 million in principal repayments under credit facilities.
69891_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Financial Position During Fiscal 2015, our working capital increased $22.9 million to $101.5 million primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.
69891_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Trade receivables increased $1.7 million due to higher sales activity and days sales outstanding improved from 34.7 days to 33.1 days.
69891_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	Inventories decreased $1.0 million and annual inventory turns improved from 9.4 to 10.2 times.

69891_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Contractual obligations at May 2, 2015 are payable as follows:
69891_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	As of May 2, 2015, we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $4.9 million.
69891_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates on August 1, 2017, the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount.
69891_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee.
69891_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan.
69891_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Total contributions were $2.7 million for Fiscal 2015, $2.7 million for Fiscal 2014 and $2.6 million for Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for specific periods and therefore have not been included in the table above.
69891_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.2 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs.
69891_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	These standby letters of credit expire through March 2016 and are expected to be renewed.
69891_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Credit Risk We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
69891_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success in acquiring other beverage businesses, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies, ability to pass along cost increases to our customers, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unseasonably cold ,wet weather conditions or droughts and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders.
69891_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodities We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest Rates At May 2, 2015, the Company had $10 million in borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 1.0%.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Interest rate hedging products are not currently used to mitigate risk from interest fluctuations.
69891_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If the interest rate on our debt changed by 100 basis points (1%), our interest expense for Fiscal 2015 would have changed by approximately $200,000.
69891_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

69891_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and sells a diverse portfolio of flavored beverage products primarily in North America.
69891_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries.
69891_15_ITEM8_P6_S1	When used in this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.
69891_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries.
69891_15_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
69891_15_ITEM8_P7_S3	Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and, as a result, an additional week is added every five or six years.
69891_15_ITEM8_P7_S4	Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks while Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks.
69891_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid securities (consisting primarily of short-term money-market investments) with an original maturity of three months or less.
69891_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in raw material costs.
69891_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 206,000 shares in Fiscal 2015, 188,000 shares in Fiscal 2014 and 172,000 shares in Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty.
69891_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the best information available.
69891_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	At May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014, other liabilities included accruals of $5.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for estimated non-current risk retention exposures, of which $4.7 million and $5.1 million were covered by insurance.
69891_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets as of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks.
69891_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.
69891_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Inventories at May 2, 2015 were comprised of finished goods of $24.9 million and raw materials of $18.0 million.
69891_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Inventories at May 3, 2014 were comprised of finished goods of $27.2 million and raw materials of $16.7 million.
69891_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Marketing Costs We are involved in a variety of marketing programs, including cooperative advertising programs with customers, to advertise and promote our products to consumers.
69891_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Marketing costs are expensed when incurred, except for prepaid advertising and production costs which are expensed when the advertising takes place.
69891_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Marketing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $42.4 million in Fiscal 2015, $50.2 million in Fiscal 2014 and $44.6 million in Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ).
69891_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.
69891_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	ASU 2014-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30, 2017.
69891_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_15_ITEM8_P25_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
69891_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Such costs aggregated $44.4 million in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 and $44.2 million in Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Trade Receivables We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
69891_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	As of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.
69891_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Property, plant and equipment as of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 consisted of the following:
69891_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Depreciation expense was $10.2 million for Fiscal 2015, $9.8 million for Fiscal 2014 and $9.0 million for Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Accrued liabilities as of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 consisted of the following:
69891_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	At May 2, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $100 million (the Credit Facilities ).
69891_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Credit Facilities expire from October 10, 2017 to June 18, 2018 and current borrowings bear interest at .9% above one-month LIBOR (1.0% at May 2, 2015).
69891_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities were $10 million at May 2, 2015 and $30 million at May 3, 2014.
69891_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	At May 2, 2015, $2.2 million of the Credit Facilities were reserved for standby letters of credit and $87.8 million were available for borrowings.
69891_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, principally debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities), and contain other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.
69891_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	At May 2, 2015, we were in compliance with all loan covenants.
69891_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company paid special cash dividends on common stock of $118.1 million ($2.55 per share) on December 27, 2012.
69891_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	On January 25, 2013, the Company sold 400,000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share ( Series D Preferred ) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million.
69891_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Series D Preferred has a liquidation preference of $50 per share and accrues dividends on this amount at an annual rate of 3% through April 30, 2014 and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to 370 basis points above the 3-Month LIBOR.
69891_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly.
69891_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	Accrued dividends at May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 were $37,000 and $90,000, respectively.
69891_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Series D Preferred is nonvoting and redeemable at the option of the Company beginning May 1, 2014 at $50 per share.
69891_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The net proceeds of $19.7 million were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Facilities.
69891_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	In addition, the Company has 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, which are held as treasury stock and, therefore, such shares have no liquidation value.
69891_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	On May 2, 2014, the Company redeemed 160,000 shares of Series D Preferred, representing 40% of the amount outstanding, for an aggregate price of $8 million plus accrued dividends.
69891_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	In connection therewith, the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $118,000 of original issuance costs, which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation.
69891_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	In conjunction with the partial redemption, the annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred was reduced to 2.5% for the twelve month period beginning May 1, 2014.
69891_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	In evaluating the impact of the rate change, the Company determined that the related fair value change was immaterial and that no adjustment was required.

69891_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	In connection therewith, the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $89,000 of original issuance costs, which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation.
69891_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	On May 1, 2015, the Company and the holders of the Series D Preferred agreed to extend the 2.5% annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred through April 30, 2016.

69891_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	There were no shares purchased during the last three fiscal years.
69891_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.
69891_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and, while shareholder value has increased over 2,000% since the inception of this agreement, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	We incurred management fees to CMA of $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015, $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014 and $6.6 million for Fiscal 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $1.6 million at May 2, 2015 and at May 3, 2014.
69891_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	From time to time, we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans.
69891_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013:
69891_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of May 2, 2015, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $38.0 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $3.0 million of unrealized loss before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next 12 months.
69891_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	As of May 2, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability and derivative long-term liability was $3.0 million and $751,000, which was included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively.
69891_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	As of May 3, 2014, the fair value of the derivative asset was $5,000, which was included in prepaid and other assets.
69891_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 consisted of the following:
69891_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	During April 2014, the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its review of the Company s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	No material adjustments were proposed and, accordingly, the Company adjusted the related unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014.
69891_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	As of May 2, 2015, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.8 million and $191,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2015.
69891_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.2 million.
69891_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	_______________________________ * Includes $1,907 related to the Internal Revenue Service review of the Company s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013 noted above.
69891_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	As of May 2, 2015, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $269,000, of which approximately $82,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2015.
69891_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_15_ITEM8_P64_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_15_ITEM8_P64_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2013 are subject to examination.
69891_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2010.
69891_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the shareholders.
69891_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan ) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above.
69891_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	Stock options granted were 276,800 shares in Fiscal 2015, 5,245 shares in Fiscal 2014 and 2,000 shares in Fiscal 2013.

69891_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_15_ITEM8_P73_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and ranged from 0% to 16% for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.

69891_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of National Beverage Corp.
69891_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Beverage Corp. as of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 2, 2015.
69891_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	We also have audited National Beverage Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of May 2, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
69891_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_15_ITEM8_P92_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_15_ITEM8_P93_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_15_ITEM8_P93_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_15_ITEM8_P93_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_15_ITEM8_P95_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of May 2, 2015 and May 3, 2014 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 2, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 2, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
69891_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
69891_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 2, 2015.
69891_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.

69891_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	The locations of our facilities enable us to efficiently produce and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas.

69891_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products.
69891_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions.
69891_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products.
69891_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can craft our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences.

69891_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system.
69891_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our production facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods.
69891_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution.
69891_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	These include development of products, packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
69891_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers.
69891_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty.
69891_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks.
69891_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	The emphasis of our sales and marketing programs is to maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty, typically through a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements, sponsorships and social media, along with consumer coupon distribution and product sampling.
69891_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	We retain agencies to assist with social media engagement and advertising programs for our brands.
69891_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives.
69891_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	These elements allow tailored marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics.
69891_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick s soft drinks and special holiday flavors and packaging.
69891_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	In recent years, we ve expanded our programs to reach consumers directly through innovative digital marketing, social media engagement and content creation.
69891_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	We are focused on increasing our digital presence and capabilities to further enhance the consumer experience across our brands.
69891_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods.
69891_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our production facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages.
69891_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners, juice and flavor concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans, paper, cartons and closures.
69891_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame, stevia or acesulfame potassium.
69891_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	We craft a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities.
69891_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions.
69891_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_16_ITEM1_P47_S5	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months.
69891_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Additionally, our sales can be influenced by weather conditions.
69891_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas.
69891_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, focused advertising and social media, and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
69891_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
69891_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Certain states and localities require a deposit or tax on the sale of certain beverages.
69891_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
69891_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
69891_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position.
69891_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
69891_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
69891_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	As of April 30, 2016, we employed approximately 1,200 people, of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
69891_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
69891_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	In addition, our Code of Ethics is available on our website.
69891_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Changes in consumer preferences and taste.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	There has been an increasing focus on health and wellness by beverage consumers, which may reduce demand for caloric carbonated soft drinks and increase the consumption of products perceived to deliver health, wellness and/or functionality.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our inability to meet the demands of our larger customers could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard, water and fruit juice.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have enacted or considered imposing additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Changes in existing laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our profitability is affected by the cost of medical and retirement benefits provided to employees, including employees covered under collective bargaining agreements and multi-employer pension plans.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In recent years, we have experienced increases in these costs as a result of certain factors beyond our control.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Although we seek to limit these cost increases, continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect our ability to produce and distribute products.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
69891_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected.
69891_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve production facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten production facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two production facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease office and warehouse space, transportation equipment, office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

69891_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our brands emphasize distinctly-flavored beverages in attractive packaging that appeal to multiple demographic groups.
69891_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The attentive, conscious and discriminating consumer is ever more alert to healthy choices and better-for-you ingredients that align to this transition and strategic focus.

69891_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months.
69891_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable.
69891_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Additionally, our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, changes in consumer preference for beverage products, competitive pricing in the marketplace and weather conditions.
69891_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Net Sales Net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 ( Fiscal 2016 ) increased 9.1% to $704.8 million compared to $645.8 million for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2015 ( Fiscal 2015 ).
69891_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The higher sales resulted from a 9.0% increase in case volume and a slight increase in average selling price.
69891_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The volume increase includes 31.4% growth of our Power+ Brands, partially offset by a decline in branded carbonated soft drinks and Allied Brands.
69891_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Net sales for Fiscal 2015 increased .7% to $645.8 million compared to $641.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 3, 2014 ( Fiscal 2014 ).

69891_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The increase in case volume reflects a 2.9% increase in branded volume, including a 15.3% case volume growth for our Power+ Brands, partially offset by a decline in Allied Brands.
69891_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The decline in average selling price is related to changes in product mix.
69891_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Gross Profit Gross profit for Fiscal 2016 increased 10.2% to $241.4 million compared to $219.1 million for Fiscal 2015.
69891_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in gross profit is primarily due to higher sales and a decline in cost of sales per case of .4%.
69891_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	The decrease in cost of sales per case was due to favorable product mix changes and lower raw material costs.
69891_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	As a result, gross margin improved to 34.3%.
69891_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Gross profit was 33.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Cost of sales per unit declined .3% primarily due to product mix changes.

69891_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	However, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $148.4 million or 21.1% of net sales for Fiscal 2016 compared to $145.2 million or 22.5% of net sales for Fiscal 2015.

69891_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $145.2 million or 22.5% of net sales for Fiscal 2015 compared to $153.2 million or 23.9% of net sales for Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Fiscal 2015 expenses reflect lower selling and marketing costs.

69891_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	The change in interest income is due to changes in average invested balances.
69891_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	Other income for Fiscal 2015 includes a $1.3 million gain on sale of property.
69891_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 34% for Fiscal 2016, 34% for Fiscal 2015 and 30.9% for Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, the domestic manufacturing deduction and, for Fiscal 2014, adjustment of unrecognized tax benefits related to the resolution of certain open tax years.

69891_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Cash provided by operating activities increased $20.9 million primarily due to increased earnings and favorable changes in working capital.
69891_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	Cash used in investing activities increased $2.3 million reflecting higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from the sale of property.

69891_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Financial Position During Fiscal 2016, our working capital increased to $148.1 million from $101.5 million at May 2, 2015.
69891_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in working capital resulted from higher cash, trade receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
69891_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Trade receivables increased $1.1 million due to higher sales activity while days sales outstanding improved to 31.0 days from 33.1 days.
69891_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Inventories increased $5.0 million as a result of the Company maintaining higher finished goods levels to support increases in sales and new product introductions.
69891_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	Annual inventory turns decreased to 9.5 from 10.2 times.
69891_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	At April 30, 2016, the current ratio was 3.0 to 1 compared to 2.5 to 1 at May 2, 2015.

69891_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	As of April 30, 2016, we guaranteed the residual value of certain leased equipment in the amount of $4.4 million.
69891_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	If the proceeds from the sale of such equipment are less than the balance required by the lease when the lease terminates on August 1, 2017, the Company shall be required to pay the difference up to such guaranteed amount.
69891_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company expects to have no loss on such guarantee.
69891_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit sharing plan.
69891_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Total contributions were $2.9 million for Fiscal 2016, $2.7 million for Fiscal 2015 and $2.7 million for Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for specific periods and therefore such payments have not been included in the table above.
69891_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.2 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs.
69891_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	These standby letters of credit expire through March 2017 and are expected to be renewed.
69891_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Credit Risk We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
69891_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies, ability to pass along cost increases to our customers, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unfavorable weather conditions and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders.
69891_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodities We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish all, or a portion of, the purchase prices for certain raw materials.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest Rates During Fiscal 2016, the Company repaid $10 million in borrowings under its credit facilities.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At April 30, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Interest rate hedging products are not used to mitigate risk from interest fluctuations.
69891_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	If the interest rate on our debt changed by 100 basis points (1%), our interest expense for Fiscal 2016 would have changed by approximately $50,000.

69891_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries.
69891_16_ITEM8_P7_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
69891_16_ITEM8_P7_S3	Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and, as a result, an additional week is added every five or six years.
69891_16_ITEM8_P7_S4	Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 consisted of 52 weeks while Fiscal 2014 consisted of 53 weeks.
69891_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid securities (consisting primarily of short-term money-market investments) with an original maturity of three months or less.
69891_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in raw material costs.
69891_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_16_ITEM8_P9_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_16_ITEM8_P9_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 219,000 shares in Fiscal 2016, 206,000 shares in Fiscal 2015 and 188,000 shares in Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty.
69891_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.

69891_16_ITEM8_P21_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30, 2017.
69891_16_ITEM8_P21_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ).
69891_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
69891_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	ASU 2016-02 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 28, 2019.
69891_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ).
69891_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	ASU 2015-17 requires companies to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
69891_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	ASU 2015-17 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30, 2017.
69891_16_ITEM8_P23_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ).
69891_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.
69891_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 29, 2018.
69891_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_16_ITEM8_P25_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_16_ITEM8_P29_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
69891_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Such costs aggregated $44.6 million in Fiscal 2016 and $44.4 million in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.

69891_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.

69891_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.
69891_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and, while shareholder value has increased over $2.5 billion (or 6,000%) since the inception of this agreement, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	We incurred management fees to CMA of $7.0 million for Fiscal 2016, $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015 and $6.4 million for Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $1.8 million at April 30, 2016 and $1.6 million at May 2, 2015.
69891_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	From time to time, we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans.
69891_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings through cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014:
69891_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	As of April 30, 2016, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $14.4 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $2.5 million of unrealized loss before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next 12 months.
69891_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	As of April 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability was $2.5 million, which was included in accrued liabilities.
69891_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	As of May 2, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability and derivative long-term liability was $3.0 million and $751,000, which was included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively.
69891_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 30, 2016 and May 2, 2015 consisted of the following:
69891_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	During April 2014, the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its review of the Company s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013.
69891_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	No material adjustments were proposed and, accordingly, the Company adjusted the related unrecognized tax benefits during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014.
69891_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	As of April 30, 2016, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.7 million and $59,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2016.
69891_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.2 million.
69891_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	_______________________________ * Includes $1,907 related to the Internal Revenue Service review of the Company s federal income tax returns for the three years ended April 2013 noted above.

69891_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_16_ITEM8_P68_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_16_ITEM8_P68_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2013 are subject to examination.
69891_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2010.
69891_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the shareholders.

69891_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	Stock options granted were 3,500 shares in Fiscal 2016, 276,800 shares in Fiscal 2015 and 5,245 shares in Fiscal 2014.

69891_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_16_ITEM8_P77_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and ranged from 0% to 16% for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.

69891_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	We also have audited National Beverage Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
69891_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_16_ITEM8_P97_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_16_ITEM8_P98_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_16_ITEM8_P98_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of April 30, 2016 and May 2, 2015 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2016.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
69891_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Bracken, Executive Vice President - Finance of the Company, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 1350, as adopted pursuant to section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:
69891_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and result of operations of the Company.
69891_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	The information required by Item 13 will be included under the captions Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Information Regarding Meetings and Committees of the Board in the Company s 2017 Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our beverage portfolio is comprised of a number of unique brands with reputations and consumer imagery that have been built over time.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our investments in social media and marketing as well as our strong commitment to product quality are intended to have a favorable impact on brand image and consumer preferences.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Unfavorable publicity, or allegations of quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and brand image and may cause consumers to choose other products.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, if we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, E-commerce transactions and value stores are experiencing rapid growth.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our inability to adapt to customer requirements could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard, water and fruit juice.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply of raw materials and energy.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have enacted or are considering additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our profitability is affected by the cost of medical and retirement benefits provided to employees, including employees covered under collective bargaining agreements and multi-employer pension plans.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In recent years, we have experienced increases in these costs as a result of certain factors beyond our control.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although we seek to limit these cost increases, continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect our ability to produce and distribute products.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
69891_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected.
69891_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve production facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten production facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two production facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	Although we are continually investing in more efficient equipment, we are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease warehouse and office space, transportation equipment, office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

69891_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Beverage sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months.
69891_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable.

69891_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in sales resulted primarily from a 16.6% increase in case volume and, to a lesser extent, a higher average selling price.

69891_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The volume increase includes 31.4% growth of our Power+ Brands, partially offset by a decline in carbonated soft drinks.

69891_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	The decline in cost of sales per case was due to favorable product mix changes and lower raw material costs.

69891_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $163.6 million or 19.8% of net sales for Fiscal 2017, increasing $15.2 million or 10.3% from Fiscal 2016.

69891_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a percent of Net sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the leveraging effects of higher volume on fixed costs and growth of products distributed by customer pick-up.

69891_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Due to prior year repayments on borrowings, interest expense decreased to $189,000 in Fiscal 2017 from $203,000 in Fiscal 2016 and $371,000 in Fiscal 2015.

69891_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	The change in interest income is due to changes in average invested balances and increased return on investments.
69891_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	Other income for Fiscal 2015 includes a $1.3 million gain on sale of property.
69891_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for Fiscal 2017, 34% for Fiscal 2016 and 34% for Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and the domestic manufacturing deduction.

69891_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	The Company does not expect to incur a loss on such guarantee.

69891_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Annual contributions were $3.1 million for Fiscal 2017, $2.9 million for Fiscal 2016 and $2.7 million for Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for specific periods and therefore such payments have not been included in the table above.
69891_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.2 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs.
69891_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	These standby letters of credit expire through March 2018 and are expected to be renewed.
69891_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment .
69891_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Credit Risk We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Sales incentives are accrued over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	When the incentive is paid in advance, the aggregate incentive is recorded as a prepaid and amortized over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
69891_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	These statements are "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "expects," and "estimates" constitute "forward-looking statements" and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
69891_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies, ability to pass along cost increases to our customers, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in brand image, consumer preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unfavorable weather conditions and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders.
69891_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Commodities We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish all, or a portion of, the purchase prices for certain raw materials.
69891_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Interest Rates During Fiscal 2016, the Company repaid $10 million in borrowings under its credit facilities.
69891_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At April 29, 2017, the Company had no borrowings outstanding.

69891_17_ITEM8_P7_S3	Our fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to April 30 and, as a result, an additional week is added every five or six years.
69891_17_ITEM8_P7_S4	Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 consisted of 52 weeks.
69891_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid securities (consisting primarily of short-term money-market investments) with an original maturity of three months or less.
69891_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in raw material costs.
69891_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
69891_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
69891_17_ITEM8_P9_S3	Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements.
69891_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
69891_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 206,000 shares in Fiscal 2017, 219,000 shares in Fiscal 2016 and 206,000 shares in Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate and lack of prepayment penalty.
69891_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.
69891_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	These values represent the estimated amounts we would receive upon sale, taking into consideration current market prices and credit worthiness.
69891_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	Insurance Programs We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	At April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016, other liabilities included accruals of $6.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for estimated non-current risk retention exposures, of which $5.4 million and $4.8 million were covered by insurance.
69891_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets as of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 consisted of non-amortizable trademarks .
69891_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.

69891_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ).
69891_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	This amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
69891_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30, 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P21_S3	Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
69891_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ).
69891_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
69891_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	ASU 2016-02 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 28, 2019.
69891_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
69891_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ).
69891_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	ASU 2015-17 requires companies to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
69891_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	ASU 2015-17 is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 30, 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	When implemented, current deferred tax asset will be reclassified to noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet.
69891_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ).
69891_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.
69891_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 29, 2018.
69891_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements; however, adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
69891_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
69891_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.
69891_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
69891_17_ITEM8_P25_S3	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
69891_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
69891_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery.
69891_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Our policy is not to allow the return of products once they have been accepted by the customer.
69891_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	However, on occasion, we have accepted returns or issued credit to customers, primarily for damaged goods.
69891_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	The amounts have been immaterial and, accordingly, we do not provide a specific valuation allowance for sales returns.
69891_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume; otherwise, we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_17_ITEM8_P29_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
69891_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Such costs aggregated $50.0 million in Fiscal 2017, $44.6 million in Fiscal 2016 and $44.4 million in Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Trade Receivables We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
69891_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	As of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.
69891_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Property, plant and equipment as of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 consisted of the following:
69891_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Depreciation expense was $10.7 million for Fiscal 2017, $10.1 million for Fiscal 2016 and $10.2 million for Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Accrued liabilities as of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 consisted of the following:
69891_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	At April 29, 2017, a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $100 million (the Credit Facilities ).
69891_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Credit Facilities expire from October 10, 2017 to April 30, 2021 and any borrowings would currently bear interest at .9% above one-month LIBOR.
69891_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities at April 29, 2017 or April 30, 2016.
69891_17_ITEM8_P41_S3	At April 29, 2017, $2.2 million of the Credit Facilities was reserved for standby letters of credit and $97.8 million was available for borrowings.
69891_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, including debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities), and contain other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.
69891_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	At April 29, 2017, we were in compliance with all loan covenants.
69891_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company paid a special cash dividend on common stock of $69.9 million ($1.50 per share) on January 27, 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	On May 5, 2017, the Company declared a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share to shareholders of record on June 5, 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	The cash dividend of $69.9 million will be paid on or before August 4, 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	On January 25, 2013, the Company sold 400,000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share ( Series D Preferred ) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million.
69891_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Series D Preferred had a liquidation preference of $50 per share and accrued dividends on this amount at an annual rate of 3% through April 30, 2014 and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to 370 basis points above the 3- Month LIBOR rate.
69891_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	Dividends were cumulative and payable quarterly.
69891_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	There were no accrued dividends at April 29, 2017 and at April 30, 2016.
69891_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Series D Preferred was nonvoting and redeemable at the option of the Company beginning May 1, 2014 at $50 per share.
69891_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	In addition, the Company has 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, which are held as treasury stock and, therefore, such shares have no liquidation value.
69891_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	On May 2, 2014, the Company redeemed 160,000 shares of Series D Preferred, representing 40% of the amount outstanding, for an aggregate price of $8 million plus accrued dividends.
69891_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	In connection therewith, the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $118,000 of original issuance costs, which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation.
69891_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	In conjunction with the partial redemption, the annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred was reduced to 2.5% for the twelve month period beginning May 1, 2014.
69891_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	In evaluating the impact of the rate change, the Company determined that the related fair value change was immaterial and that no adjustment was required.
69891_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	On August 1, 2014, the Company redeemed 120,000 shares of Series D Preferred, representing 50% of the amount outstanding, for an aggregate price of $6 million plus accrued dividends.
69891_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	In connection therewith, the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $89,000 of original issuance costs, which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation.
69891_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	On May 1, 2015, the Company and the holders of the Series D Preferred agreed to extend the 2.5% annual dividend rate on the outstanding Series D Preferred through April 30, 2016.
69891_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	In evaluating the impact of the rate change, the Company determined that the related fair value change was immaterial and that no adjustment was required.
69891_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	On April 29, 2016, the Company redeemed the final remaining 120,000 shares of Series D Preferred for an aggregate price of $6 million plus accrued dividends.
69891_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	In connection therewith, the Company accreted and charged to retained earnings $89,000 of original issuance costs, which was deducted from income available to common shareholders for earnings per share calculation.
69891_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company is authorized under its stock buyback program to repurchase 1.6 million shares of Common Stock.
69891_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	As of April 29, 2017, 502,060 shares were purchased under the program and 1,097,940 shares were available for purchase.
69891_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	No shares of Common Stock have been repurchased during the last three fiscal years.
69891_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and management information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA.
69891_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and, while shareholder value has increased over $4.5 billion (or 10,000%) since the inception of this agreement, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	We incurred management fees to CMA of $8.3 million for Fiscal 2017, $7.0 million for Fiscal 2016 and $6.5 million for Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $2.1 million at April 29, 2017 and $1.8 million at April 30, 2016.
69891_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	From time to time, we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans.
69891_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( AOCI ) and reclassified into cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015:
69891_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	As of April 29, 2017, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $56.7 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $246,000 of unrealized loss before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next 12 months.
69891_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	As of April 29, 2017, the fair value of the derivative asset, derivative liability and derivative long-term liability was $602,000, $848,000 and $476,000, which was included in prepaid and other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively.
69891_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	As of April 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability was $2.5 million, which was included in accrued liabilities.
69891_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 consisted of the following:
69891_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	As of April 29, 2017, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.7 million and $66,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.2 million.
69891_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	As of April 29, 2017, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $239,000, of which approximately $12,000 was recognized as a tax benefit in Fiscal 2017.
69891_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_17_ITEM8_P67_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_17_ITEM8_P67_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2013 are subject to examination.
69891_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2010.
69891_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of the shareholders.
69891_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan ) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above.
69891_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_17_ITEM8_P74_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_17_ITEM8_P74_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	No stock options were granted in Fiscal 2017, 3,500 shares were granted in Fiscal 2016 and 276,800 shares in Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM8_P75_S3	The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 8.0 years for Fiscal 2016 and 7.4 years for Fiscal 2015; weighted average expected volatility of 29.0% for Fiscal 2016 and 32.8% for Fiscal 2015; weighted average risk free interest rates of 2.1% for Fiscal 2016 and 2.2% for Fiscal 2015; and expected dividend yield of 3.3% for Fiscal 2016 and 4.6% for Fiscal 2015.
69891_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_17_ITEM8_P76_S3	Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and ranged in values up to 16% for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016.

69891_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	During Fiscal 2017, a subsidiary of the Company reached a settlement with respect to a notification of withdrawal liability by one of the multi-employer pension plans not considered significant.

69891_17_ITEM8_P88_S2	Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

69891_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	We also have audited National Beverage Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of April 29, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
69891_17_ITEM8_P96_S2	National Beverage Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
69891_17_ITEM8_P96_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
69891_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
69891_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
69891_17_ITEM8_P97_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_17_ITEM8_P97_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_17_ITEM8_P97_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Beverage Corp. as of April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 29, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
69891_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Also in our opinion, National Beverage Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 29, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 29, 2017.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
69891_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

69891_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can craft our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while innovating flavors to meet changing consumer preferences.

69891_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores.
69891_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We distribute our products to this channel primarily through the warehouse distribution system and to a lesser extent, the direct-store delivery system.
69891_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our production facilities to the retailer s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its store locations with other goods.
69891_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	This method allows our retail partners to further maximize assets by utilizing their ability to pick-up product at our warehouses, thus further lowering their/our product costs.
69891_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
69891_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors.
69891_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts.
69891_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have developed packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
69891_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers.
69891_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers.
69891_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands.
69891_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers.
69891_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	We believe vending and cooler equipment magnifies on-site visual trial thus increasing sales and enhancing brand awareness.
69891_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks.
69891_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines.
69891_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
69891_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	The emphasis of our marketing consists of programs to reach consumers directly through innovative digital marketing, digital social marketing, social media engagement and creative content.
69891_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	We are focused on increasing our digital presence and capabilities to further enhance the consumer experience across our brands.
69891_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	We may retain agencies to assist with social media content creative and platform selection for our brands.
69891_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Additionally, we maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty through a combination of regional event participation, special event marketing, endorsements, consumer coupon distribution and product sampling.
69891_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, Brand ED ambassadors, in-store promotional activities and other incentives.
69891_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	These elements allow marketing and other consumer programs to be tailored to meet local and regional demographics.
69891_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of ingredients and packaging.
69891_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	By consolidating the purchasing function for our production facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as an efficient producer of beverages.
69891_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles, water, carbon dioxide, juice and flavor concentrates, sweeteners, cartons and closures.
69891_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We craft a substantial portion of our flavor essences and concentrates while purchasing the remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
69891_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials.
69891_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities.
69891_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions.
69891_18_ITEM1_P43_S3	In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations.
69891_18_ITEM1_P43_S4	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in costs of raw materials, holiday and seasonal programming and weather conditions.
69891_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	While yesteryear witnessed more seasonality, higher sales are realized during the summer when outdoor activities are more prevalent.
69891_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	While LaCroix Sparkling Water achieved double-digit growth in all of the 52 Nielsen metropolitan statistical areas in fiscal 2018 and is the significant brand of choice as the number one sparkling water in 42 of those markets, the beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position may vary by market area.
69891_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including water products, soft drinks, juices, fruit drinks, energy drinks and sports drinks, as well as powdered drinks, coffees, teas, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages.
69891_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products.
69891_18_ITEM1_P45_S3	Several competitors, including those that dominate the beverage industry, such as Nestl S.A., PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products may adversely affect sales of our brands.
69891_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods.
69891_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe our Company differentiates itself through novel methods of innovation, key brand recognition, focused social media, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, and, for some product lines, value pricing.
69891_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business.
69891_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
69891_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
69891_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
69891_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Certain states and localities require a deposit or tax on the sale of certain beverages.
69891_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	These requirements vary by each jurisdiction.
69891_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress.
69891_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
69891_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
69891_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position.
69891_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	We believe our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
69891_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	As of April 28, 2018, we employed approximately 1,500 people, of which 370 are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
69891_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	We believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
69891_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at www.nationalbeverage.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	In addition, our Code of Ethics is available on our website.
69891_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	The information on the Company s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report that we file with, or furnish to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company s business.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and results of operations.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our beverage portfolio is comprised of a number of unique brands with time-tested reputations and consumer loyalty that have been built over time.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our investments in social media and marketing as well as our strong commitment to product quality are intended to have a favorable impact on brand image and consumer preferences.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Unfavorable publicity, or allegations of quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and brand image and could cause consumers to choose other products.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, if we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The beverage industry is extremely competitive.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In order to generate future revenues and profits, we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Discounting and other actions by our competitors may make it more difficult to sustain revenues and profits.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our retail customer base has been consolidating over the last several years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, e-commerce transactions and value stores are experiencing rapid growth.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our inability to adapt to customer requirements could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard, water and fruit juice.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	These items are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, tariffs, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply and cost of raw materials and energy.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If raw materials or energy costs increase, or the availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, various governmental agencies have enacted or are considering additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our profitability is affected by the cost of medical and retirement benefits provided to employees, including employees covered under collective bargaining agreements and multi-employer pension plans.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In recent years, we have experienced increases in these costs as a result of certain factors beyond our control.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Although we seek to limit these cost increases, continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect our ability to produce and distribute products.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
69891_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected.
69891_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our principal properties include twelve production facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet.
69891_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	We own ten production facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
69891_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Two production facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2020.
69891_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.
69891_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change.
69891_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields.
69891_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	Although we are continually investing in more efficient equipment, we are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
69891_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own and lease trucks, vans and automobiles used in the sale, delivery and distribution of our products.
69891_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease warehouse and office space, transportation equipment, office equipment and certain manufacturing equipment.
69891_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are a party to various litigation matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
69891_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	We do not expect the ultimate disposition of such matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
69891_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The common stock of National Beverage Corp., par value $.01 per share, ( Common Stock ) is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FIZZ .

69891_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	National Beverage Corp. innovatively refreshes America with a distinctive portfolio of sparkling waters, juices and, to a lesser degree, energy drinks.
69891_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Over the past few years, our carbonated soft drink brands continue to be modified as we endeavor to make them more adaptable to our consumers.
69891_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe our ingenious product designs, innovative packaging and imaginative flavors, along with our corporate culture and philosophy, make National Beverage unique as a stand-alone entity in the beverage industry.
69891_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	January 1986 found our infant company in possession of a month-old, typical soda pop manufacturer whose acquisition cost had not yet been determined.
69891_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	One, at the time, could have described it as a Hail Mary attempt to thwart another corporate 1980 s raider takeover.
69891_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	We primarily employ the warehouse delivery system, which due to the bricks and mortar costs to all retailers, allows our retail partners to further maximize assets by utilizing their ability to pick up product at our warehouses, thus further lowering their/our product costs.
69891_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	From our corporate philosophy, development of products, marketing to manufacturing, we are converting consumers to a Better for You thirst quencher that compassionately cares for their nutritional health.
69891_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	As the cornerstone relative to the lead-in paragraph emphasizing National Beverage s uniqueness:
69891_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Many believe that if you put good in Great comes out . . .
69891_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Presently, National Beverage Corp. is uniquely positioned in three distinctive ways:
69891_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The retail grocery industry is in revolution.
69891_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Yesteryear, each retailer induced their consumer with a proprietary brand (especially soft drinks), but today understand s that the well-informed, smart consumer is demanding that retailers provide recognizable brands that have earned their respective consumer standing on their merits.
69891_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The retail grocer today is in the most competitive-indexed service industry, without exception.
69891_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Innovation, plus the urgent time demands on the consumer, is requiring quick, expedient shopping and home delivery is even more of a current shoppers choice.
69891_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Retailers cannot carry slower-moving items that home delivery will not support.
69891_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	The new Millennial consumer is the most competent/knowledgeable product analyzer ever, and personal mental/physical lifestyles demand that healthier is their preferred choice.
69891_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Calories must qualify as worthy; sugar being enemy #1 in the life of the Millennial.
69891_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our strategy seeks the profitable growth of our products by (i) developing healthier beverages in response to the global shift in consumer buying habits and tailoring our beverage portfolio to the preferences of a diverse mix of crossover consumers a growing group desiring a healthier alternative to artificially sweetened and high-caloric beverages; (ii) emphasizing unique flavor development and variety throughout our brands that appeal to multiple demographic groups; (iii) maintaining points of difference through innovative marketing, packaging and consumer engagement and (iv) responding faster and more creatively to changing consumer trends that larger competitors who are burdened by legacy production, distribution complexity and costs cannot quickly comply with.
69891_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Presently, our primary market focus is the United States and Canada.
69891_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Certain of our products are also distributed on a limited basis in other countries and options to expand distribution to other regions are being considered.
69891_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers, as well as thousands of smaller up-and-down-the-street accounts, we utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products primarily through the warehouse delivery system and distributors.
69891_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	National Beverage Corp. is incorporated in Delaware and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991.
69891_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	In this report, the terms we, us, our, Company and National Beverage mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.
69891_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, holiday and seasonal programming and weather conditions.
69891_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	While yesteryear witnessed more seasonality, higher sales are realized during the summer when outdoor activities are more prevalent.
69891_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our highly innovative business, where new beverages are developed and produced for selective holidays and ceremonial dates, should not be analyzed on the common three-month (quarterly) periods, traditionally found acceptable.
69891_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Today, costly development projects and seasonal weather periods plus promotional packaging, make quarter-to-quarter comparisons unworthy statistics and forces companies to decision making for that purpose, not truly beneficial for investors and shareholders alike.
69891_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Traditional and typical are not a part of an innovator s vocabulary.
69891_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Net sales for fiscal year ended April 28, 2018 ( Fiscal 2018 ) increased 18.0% to $975.7 million compared to $826.9 million for fiscal year ended April 29, 2017 ( Fiscal 2017 ).
69891_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase in sales resulted primarily from a 19.8% increase in branded case volume and, to a lesser extent, a higher average selling price.
69891_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Power+ Brands volume increased 38.9%; branded carbonated soft drinks volume declined by 6.2%.
69891_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	The Company discontinued its lower-margin, private-label carbonated soft drink business in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, allowing future performance to be more focused on brand equity appreciation.
69891_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Net sales for Fiscal 2017 increased 17.3% to $826.9 million compared to $704.8 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 ( Fiscal 2016 ).
69891_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in sales resulted primarily from a 16.6% increase in case volume and, to a lesser extent, a higher average selling price.
69891_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Power+ Brands volume increased 42.6%; branded carbonated soft drinks volume was flat.
69891_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Gross profit for Fiscal 2018 increased 20.0% to $391.1 million compared to $326.1million for Fiscal 2017.
69891_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The increase in gross profit is due to increased volume and growth in higher margin Power+ Brands, offset in part by increased cost of sales per case.
69891_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	Cost of sales per case increased 1.0% primarily due to higher aluminum costs.
69891_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Gross profit for Fiscal 2017 increased 35.1% to $326.1 million compared to $241.4 million for Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in gross profit was due to increased volume, growth in higher margin Power+ Brands and a decline in cost of sales per case of 5.7%.
69891_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The decrease in cost of sales per case was due to favorable product mix changes and lower raw material costs.
69891_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies.
69891_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	However, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $186.9 million or 19.2% of net sales for Fiscal 2018, increasing $23.3 million from Fiscal 2017.
69891_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase was primarily due to shipping and other volume-related expenses and marketing spending increases.
69891_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the leveraging effects of higher volume on fixed costs.
69891_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $163.6 million or 19.8% of net sales for Fiscal 2017 compared to $148.4 million or 21.1% of net sales for Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase was primarily due to shipping and other volume-related expenses and marketing spending increases.
69891_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the leveraging effects of higher volume on fixed costs and growth of products distributed by customer pick-up.
69891_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Interest expense is comprised of fees related to maintaining lines of credit and, for part of Fiscal 2016, interest on borrowings.
69891_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Interest expense was essentially flat for all years presented.
69891_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Other expense is net of interest income of $1.6 million for Fiscal 2018, $.6 million for Fiscal 2017 and $.1 million for Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	The change in interest income is due to changes in average invested balances and increased return on investments.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our effective tax rate was 27.1% for Fiscal 2018, 34.3% for Fiscal 2017 and 34% for Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	The reduction in the effective tax rate was due to the statutory rate decreases set forth in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) enacted into law on December 22, 2017.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Under the Tax Act, the applicable federal statutory rate was 30.4% for Fiscal 2018.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Included in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 is a one-time adjustment reducing income tax expense to remeasure previous deferred tax liabilities of $4.3 million.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	In all years, the difference between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate was due to the effects of state income taxes, the domestic manufacturing deduction and share-based payment awards.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S5	The applicable federal statutory rate under the Tax Act will be reduced to 21% for fiscal 2019.
69891_18_ITEM7_P25_S6	See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
69891_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations.
69891_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	At April 28, 2018, we maintained $100 million unsecured revolving credit facilities, under which no borrowings were outstanding and $2.1 million was reserved for standby letters of credit.

69891_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	Cash used in financing activities includes the $69.9 million ($1.50 per share) special cash dividend paid on January 27, 2017.

69891_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	The increase in working capital resulted from higher cash, trade receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
69891_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Trade receivables increased $13.0 million or 18.3% due to increased sales, and days sales outstanding increased to 31.4 days from 30.6 days.

69891_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance, based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for specific periods and therefore such payments have not been included in the table above.
69891_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.1 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs.
69891_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	These standby letters of credit expire through March 2019 and are expected to be renewed.
69891_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.
69891_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
69891_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
69891_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and historical write-offs.
69891_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the best information available.
69891_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.
69891_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or, for goodwill, the carrying amount of its reporting unit, is greater than its fair value.
69891_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable.
69891_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed, more likely than not, that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers compensation exposures.
69891_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	Accordingly, we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience.
69891_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We recognize revenue upon delivery to our customers, based on written sales terms that do not allow a right of return except in rare instances.
69891_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our products are typically sold on credit, however smaller direct-store delivery accounts may be sold on a cash basis.
69891_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our credit terms typically require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment.
69891_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	We estimate and reserve for bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts, collectability and our analysis of customer data.
69891_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Sales incentives are accrued over the period of benefit or expected sales.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	When the incentive is paid in advance, the aggregate incentive is recorded as a prepaid and amortized over the period of benefit.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	Such differences are recorded once determined and have historically not been significant.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S5	We will adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its amendments on April 29, 2018.
69891_18_ITEM7_P50_S6	See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on revenue recognition and the transition to the new revenue recognition guidance.
69891_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	National Beverage and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies.
69891_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	These statements are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders.
69891_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words believes, anticipates, intends, plans, expects, and estimates constitute forward-looking statements and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

69891_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.
69891_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions.
69891_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
69891_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish all, or a portion of, the purchase prices for certain raw materials.
69891_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.
69891_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	At April 28, 2018, the Company had no borrowings outstanding.
69891_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	We had no debt-related interest rate exposure during Fiscal 2018.

69891_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 323,000 shares in Fiscal 2018, 206,000 shares in Fiscal 2017 and 219,000 shares in Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments.

69891_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
69891_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available.
69891_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows.
69891_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired.

69891_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	The updated guidance simplifies and changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including accounting for income taxes and forfeitures, as well as classification of certain items in the statement of cash flows.
69891_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective April 30, 2017 and elected to apply the cash flow guidance retrospectively; therefore, cash flow from operating activities increased and cash flow from financing activities decreased by $495 thousand and $1.5 million for the twelve months ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016, respectively.
69891_18_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company also elected to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using the forfeiture option.

69891_18_ITEM8_P22_S3	We elected not to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
69891_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ).
69891_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for goods or services.

69891_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Sales incentives are accrued over the period of benefit or expected sales volume.
69891_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	When the incentive is paid in advance, the aggregate incentive is recorded as a prepaid and amortized over the period of benefit.
69891_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors.
69891_18_ITEM8_P30_S4	Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.
69891_18_ITEM8_P30_S5	Such differences are recorded once determined and have historically not been significant.
69891_18_ITEM8_P30_S6	We will adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its amendments on April 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, with no anticipated material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	We operate as a single operating segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance.
69891_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	As such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present financial information in a format that is consistent with the internal financial information used by management.
69891_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	We do not accumulate revenues by product classification and, therefore, it is impractical to present such information.
69891_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
69891_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	Such costs aggregated $63.3 million in Fiscal 2018, $50.0 million in Fiscal 2017 and $44.6 million in Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	Although our classification is consistent with many beverage companies, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.
69891_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized over the vesting period based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
69891_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts.
69891_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral.
69891_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer.
69891_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	We monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on our experience with past due accounts, collectability and our analysis of customer data.
69891_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
69891_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	As of April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, we did not have any customer that comprised more than 10% of trade receivables.
69891_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during any of the last three fiscal years.
69891_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
69891_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results may vary from reported amounts.
69891_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Property, plant and equipment as of April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 consisted of the following:
69891_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Depreciation expense was $11.1 million for Fiscal 2018, $10.7 million for Fiscal 2017 and $10.1 million for Fiscal 2016.

69891_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	At April 28, 2018, a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $100 million (the Credit Facilities ).
69891_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Credit Facilities expire from October 3, 2020 to June 18, 2021 and any borrowings would currently bear interest at .9% above one-month LIBOR.
69891_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities at April 28, 2018 or April 29, 2017.
69891_18_ITEM8_P42_S3	At April 28, 2018, $2.1 million of the Credit Facilities was reserved for standby letters of credit and $97.9 million was available for borrowings.
69891_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, including debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities), and contain other restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our operations or financial position.
69891_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	At April 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all loan covenants.
69891_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company paid a special cash dividend on Common Stock of $69.9 million ($1.50 per share) on August 4, 2017 and January 27, 2017.
69891_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	On January 25, 2013, the Company sold 400,000 shares of Special Series D Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share ( Series D Preferred ) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million.

69891_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	In addition, the Company has 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, which are held as treasury stock.
69891_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company is authorized under its stock buyback program to repurchase 1.6 million shares of Common Stock.
69891_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	As of April 28, 2018, 502,060 shares were purchased under the program and 1,097,940 shares were available for purchase.
69891_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	No shares of Common Stock have been repurchased during the last three fiscal years.
69891_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. ( CMA ), a corporation owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
69891_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	This agreement was originated in 1991 for the efficient use of management of two public companies at the time.
69891_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	In 1994, one of those public entities, through a merger, no longer was managed in this manner.
69891_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction.
69891_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image.
69891_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, whom, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.
69891_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to one percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company, and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors may from time to time award additional incentive compensation to CMA or its personnel.
69891_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Board of Directors on numerous occasions contemplated incentive compensation and, while shareholder value has increased over $4.8 billion (or 11,000%) since the inception of this agreement, no incentive compensation has been paid.
69891_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	We incurred management fees to CMA of $9.8 million for Fiscal 2018, $8.3 million for Fiscal 2017 and $7.0 million for Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Included in accounts payable were amounts due CMA of $2.4 million at April 28, 2018 and $2.1 million at April 29, 2017.
69891_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	From time to time, we enter into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum cans.
69891_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
69891_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( AOCI ) and reclassified into cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
69891_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our cash flow hedge was immaterial.
69891_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI relative to the cash flow hedge for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016:
69891_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of April 28, 2018, the notional amount of our outstanding aluminum swap contracts was $37.5 million and, assuming no change in the commodity prices, $6.2 million of unrealized gain before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized in earnings over the next 12 months.
69891_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	As of April 28, 2018, the fair value of the derivative asset was $6.2 million, which was included in prepaid and other assets.
69891_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	As of April 29, 2017, the fair value of the derivative asset, derivative liability and derivative long-term liability was $602 thousand, $848 thousand and $476 thousand, which was included in prepaid and other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively.
69891_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	Such valuation does not entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level 2 as defined by the fair value hierarchy as they are observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
69891_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:
69891_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
69891_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 consisted of the following:
69891_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:
69891_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	As of April 28, 2018, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1.7 million and $191 thousand was recognized as a tax expense in Fiscal 2018.
69891_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be to reduce our tax expense by approximately $1.4 million.
69891_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which amounts are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is as follows:
69891_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
69891_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	As of April 28, 2018, unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $238 thousand.
69891_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) was enacted into law.
69891_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Tax Act makes changes to the U.S. tax code, including reducing the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
69891_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	The phasing in of the lower corporate income tax rate results in a blended federal statutory rate of 30.4% for our fiscal 2018, compared with the previous 35% rate.
69891_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	The federal statutory tax rate will be reduced to 21% in subsequent fiscal years.
69891_18_ITEM8_P62_S4	Included in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 is a one-time adjustment reducing income tax expense to remeasure previous deferred tax liabilities of $4.3 million.
69891_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	We file annual income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions.
69891_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is resolved.
69891_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome.
69891_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances.
69891_18_ITEM8_P63_S4	The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution.
69891_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Federal income tax returns for fiscal years subsequent to 2015 are subject to examination.
69891_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions are subject to examination for fiscal years ending after fiscal 2011.
69891_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain personnel while also aligning participant s interests with the interests of the shareholders.
69891_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	The 1991 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan ) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 4,800,000 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above.
69891_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage.
69891_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The number of shares or options which may be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 1,680,000 during any year.
69891_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as may be required by law.
69891_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a five-year period and expire after ten years.
69891_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of common stock.
69891_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	Options may be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors.
69891_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient s ownership level of common stock and the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period.
69891_18_ITEM8_P69_S3	Also, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.
69891_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program ( KEEP Program ) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 240,000 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers.
69891_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 50% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 6,000 shares in any two-year period.
69891_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options.
69891_18_ITEM8_P70_S3	Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 60% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired and the exercise price reduces to the stock par value at the end of the six-year vesting period.
69891_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	We account for stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant.
69891_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.
69891_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	Stock options granted were 500 shares in Fiscal 2018, no shares in Fiscal 2017 and 3,500 shares in Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM8_P71_S3	The weighted average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions for stock options granted are as follows: weighted average expected life of 8.0 years for Fiscal 2018 and 8.0 years for Fiscal 2016; weighted average expected volatility of 23.8% for Fiscal 2018 and 29.0% for Fiscal 2016; weighted average risk free interest rates of 2.4% for Fiscal 2018 and 2.1% for Fiscal 2016; and expected dividend yield of 1.6% for Fiscal 2018 and 3.3% for Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	The expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience.
69891_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	The expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	The risk free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.
69891_18_ITEM8_P72_S3	There were no forfeitures estimated for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2016.
69891_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	The following is a summary of stock option activity for Fiscal 2018:

69891_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company participates in three multi-employer defined benefit pension plans with respect to certain collective bargaining agreements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multi-employer plan or if other employers choose to withdraw to the extent that a mass withdrawal occurs, the Company could be required to pay the plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.
69891_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	During Fiscal 2017, a subsidiary of the Company reached a settlement with respect to a notification of withdrawal liability by one of the multi-employer pension plans not considered significant.
69891_18_ITEM8_P78_S3	The settlement did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.
69891_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	Summarized below is certain information regarding the Company s participation in significant multi-employer pension plans including the financial improvement plan or rehabilitation plan status ( FIP/RP Status ) and the zone status under the Pension Protection Act ( PPA ).

69891_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	Certain of these leases contain scheduled rent increases and/or renewal options.
69891_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	Contractual rent increases are taken into account when calculating the minimum lease payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

69891_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
69891_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
69891_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
69891_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P92_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
69891_18_ITEM8_P92_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
69891_18_ITEM8_P92_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
69891_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
69891_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
69891_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69891_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2006.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
69891_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 28, 2018.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
69891_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 28, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
