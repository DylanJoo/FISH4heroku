75679_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	In addition we are involved in the following matters:
75679_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	In September 2008, the FCC s Office of Inspector General ("OIG") initiated an investigation regarding Alaska DigiTel LLC s ( Alaska DigiTel ) compliance with program rules and requirements under the Lifeline Program.
75679_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	The request covered the period beginning January 1, 2004 through August 31, 2008 and related to amounts received for Lifeline service.
75679_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	Alaska DigiTel was an Alaska based wireless communications company of which we acquired an 81.9% equity interest on January 2, 2007 and the remaining 18.1% equity interest on August 18, 2008 and was subsequently merged with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries in April 2009.
75679_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	Prior to August 18, 2008, our control over the operations of Alaska DigiTel was limited as required by the FCC upon its approval of our initial acquisition completed in January 2007.
75679_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	We responded to this request on behalf of Alaska DigiTel and the GCI companies as affiliates.
75679_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	On January 18, 2011, we reached an agreement with the FCC and the Department of Justice to settle the matter, which required us to contribute $1.6 million to the United States Treasury and grants us a broad release of claims including those under the False Claims Act.
75679_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	In August 2010, a GCI-owned aircraft was involved in an accident resulting in five fatalities and injuries to the remaining four passengers on board.

75679_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables, unbilled revenues, accrual of the USF high-cost area program subsidy, share-based compensation, reserve for future customer credits, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, depreciable and amortizable lives of assets, the carrying value of long-lived assets including goodwill, cable certificates and wireless licenses, our effective tax rate, purchase price allocations, the accrual of cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense ("Cost of Goods Sold")), depreciation, and contingencies and litigation.
75679_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

75679_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
75679_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins.
75679_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The weakness in the national economy has negatively impacted consumer confidence and spending.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	There are some indicators that consumer confidence might be improving; however, there is no clear indication that the economy is in a recovery.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Continued stress in the economy could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	We believe the Alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Mortgage foreclosure rates in Alaska are among the lowest in the nation and the commercial real estate market is steady.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	The State of Alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the short-term.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S6	This is important for Alaska s economy as the State is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S7	The majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the Alaska economy which appears to have weathered the recessionary pressures relatively well to date.
75679_11_ITEM7_P7_S8	Nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the nation s economic changes may have on us in the future.
75679_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Effective June 1, 2008, we purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of UUI and Unicom.

75679_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Effective July 1, 2008, we closed on our purchase of 100% of the ownership interests of Alaska Wireless whose results are included in the Consumer segment.
75679_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The following table sets forth selected Statements of Operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (underlying data rounded to the nearest thousands):
75679_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on earnings before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation expense, accretion expense and non-cash contribution adjustment ( Adjusted EBITDA ).
75679_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures.

75679_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The increase in voice revenue is primarily due to a $4.4 million or 54% increase in USAC support.
75679_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	changes the variables used to calculate our estimate.
75679_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The increase in USF high cost support is primarily due to changes in the variables used to calculate our estimate and an increase in the number of local subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	This increase was partially off-set by an absence of $674,000 in support in 2009 related to services provided during the year ended December 31, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In March 2009, the FCC issued an order which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive ETCs for tribal lands in Alaska Native regions retroactive to August 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	This revenue was for the additional support for the period August to December 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The increase in video revenue is primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	An 8% increase in equipment rental revenue to $23.4 million in 2010 primarily resulting from our customers increased use of our HD/DVR converter boxes.
75679_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a 23% increase in cable modem revenue to $53.4 million due to increased subscribers, rate increases in May and August 2010, our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds, and an increase in charges for usage above plan limits .
75679_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	The increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	A $19.8 million increase in USAC support to $51.4 million.
75679_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	This increase includes a $16.3 million increase in USF high cost support and a $3.5 million increase in USF low income support.
75679_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	We accrue estimated USF high cost support revenue quarterly and adjust our revenue as we obtain new information that changes the variables used to calculate our estimate.
75679_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The increase in USF high cost support is primarily due to changes in the variables used to calculate our estimate, an increase in the number of wireless subscribers and $1.0 million for amended line count filings for which the revenue recognition criteria was met in the third quarter of 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	A $7.3 million increase in plan fee revenue to $37.8 million due to an increase in the number of wireless subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	These increases were partially off-set by the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	An absence of $1.7 million in support recorded in 2009 related to services provided during the year ended December 31, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The support was for a new local access area for which we received ETC status in May 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	An absence of $810,000 recorded in 2009 related to services provided during the year ended December 31, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	In March 2009, the FCC issued an order which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive ETCs for tribal lands in Alaska Native regions retroactive to August 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	This revenue was for the additional support for the period August to December 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to decreased voice minutes carried, cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of local access services lines on our own facilities during 2010, and a $392,000 favorable adjustment based upon refunds from several vendors.
75679_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	In the course of business we estimate unbilled long-distance services Cost of Goods Sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received, payments are made, billing matters are researched and resolved, tariffed billing periods lapse, or when disputed charges are resolved.
75679_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The increase in video Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers, increased rates paid to programmers, increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered through our HD/DVR converter boxes due to the increased number of boxes in service, and an increase in digital programming tier subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increases were partially offset by the absence of a $594,000 charge in 2009 to settle a billing issue with a cable programmer.
75679_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The decrease in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities .
75679_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in wireless Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers and an increased number of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs.
75679_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	As part of an agreement signed in December 2007 with AT T Mobility, AT T Mobility has provided to us a large block of wireless network usage at no charge that we use for roaming.
75679_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	We expect this block of minutes to expire in the first half of 2012 at which time we expect a material increase to our wireless Cost of Goods Sold estimated at $8.0 million to $10.0 million annually.
75679_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA increase is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in "Consumer Segment Revenues.
75679_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase was partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Consumer Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Consumer segment.
75679_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase in allocated selling, general and administrative expense is due primarily to an increase in the 2009 segment margin upon which the selling, general and administrative expense allocation is based and an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.

75679_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Network Access segment Adjusted EBITDA, representing 23% of 2010 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, is as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Selected key performance indicators for our Network Access segment follow:
75679_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The decrease in voice revenue is due to decreases in our average rate per minute on billable minutes carried for our common carrier customers and the transition of voice traffic to dedicated networks.
75679_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Voice revenue continues to decline as expected due to increased competition in the Network Access business.
75679_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The increased competition will continue to compress the rates we may charge our customers and, therefore, we expect a continued decline in Network Access segment voice revenue.
75679_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	The decrease is partially offset by a $3.4 million increase from growth of services sold.
75679_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The decrease in data revenue is primarily due to decreased rates for capacity purchased by our common carrier customers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The increase in wireless revenue is due to increased roaming revenue in 2010 primarily due to improved coverage and new roaming partners.
75679_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to decreased long-distance minutes carried, the movement of more traffic onto our network in lieu of carrying traffic on third party networks, and a $771,000 favorable adjustment based upon refunds from several vendors.
75679_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	In the course of business we estimate unbilled long-distance services Cost of Goods Sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received, payments are made, billing matters are researched and resolved, tariffed billing periods lapse, or when disputed charges are resolved.
75679_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	The decreases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase from growth of services sold.
75679_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The decrease in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities and a $724,000 favorable adjustment based upon refunds from several vendors.
75679_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	In the course of business we estimate unbilled data services Cost of Goods Sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	Such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received, payments are made, billing matters are researched and resolved, tariffed billing periods lapse, or when disputed charges are resolved.
75679_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The decreases were partially offset by the absence of a $585,000 favorable adjustment in 2009 resulting from a refund of fiber repair costs.
75679_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	The fiber repair costs were originally recognized in the first quarter of 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	Due to the uncertainty surrounding the refund of the fiber repair costs, we deferred recognition until collection of the refund was reasonably assured.
75679_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue as described in Network Access Segment Revenues.
75679_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	This decrease is partially off-set by decreased Cost of Goods Sold as described in Network Access Segment Cost of Goods Sold and a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Network Access segment primarily due to a decrease in the 2009 segment margin upon which the selling, general and administrative expense allocation is based.
75679_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Commercial segment revenue represented 20% of 2010 consolidated revenues.
75679_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Commercial segment data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.

75679_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, which includes data products only, increased 11% to $50.0 million in 2010 as compared to 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	The increase is primarily due to:
75679_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	A $1.2 million or 143% increase in product sales to our customers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	These increases are partially off-set by the $1.7 million in denied funding from the USAC for one ConnectMD customer for the funding year July 2008 to June 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	We received the funding commitment letter, which outlined the denied portion, in the second quarter of 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P87_S2	This denial is under appeal to the FCC.

75679_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.3 million to $228.8 million in 2010 primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	A $3.8 million increase in share-based compensation expense primarily due to the absence of a $2.4 million reversal of expense in 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The increases were partially off-set by the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	The absence of a $640,000 contribution expense recognized upon the gift of an IRU to the University of Alaska that was recorded in 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 35% in 2010 from 36% in 2009, primarily due to increasing revenues.
75679_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.8 million to $126.1 million in 2010 primarily due to new assets placed in service in 2010 partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	Other expense, net of other income, increased 19% to $70.1 million in 2010 primarily due to a $13.2 million increase in interest expense to $69.4 million in 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	The interest expense increase is due to the issuance of the 2019 Notes in November 2009 , which have a higher interest rate than the interest rate paid on our amended Senior Credit Facility, and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2010 than 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	The proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes were primarily used to repay and retire the outstanding amount due on our amended Senior Credit Facility.

75679_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $89.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 1996 to 2010 and that expire from 2011 to 2030, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2010, and that expire in 2024 through 2030, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 50% to 54% in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences in 2011 as compared to our net income before income tax expense.
75679_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Total revenues increased 4% from $575.4 million in 2008 to $595.8 million in 2009.

75679_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	The increase in voice revenue is primarily due to a $3.7 million or 82% increase in recognized support from the USAC and an increase in monthly recurring local service fee revenue.
75679_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	The increase in USAC support is primarily due to an FCC order issued in March 2009, the result of which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive ETCs for tribal lands or Alaska Native regions retroactive to August 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	issuance of this order allowed us to recognize in 2009 $674,000 in additional USAC support for services provided from August 2008 to December 2008 that is included in the revenue increase discussed above, and the removal of the cap allowed us to increase the USAC support revenue that we recognized in 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The increase in monthly recurring local service fee revenue is due to increased subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	The increase in voice revenue was partially offset by decreased long-distance billable minutes carried.
75679_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The increase in video revenue is primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	A 12% increase in equipment rental revenue to $21.6 million in 2009 primarily resulting from our customers increased use of our HD/DVR converter boxes.
75679_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a 19% increase in cable modem revenue to $43.4 million due to increased subscribers and their selection of more value-added features.
75679_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	The increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	An $11.9 million or 162% increase in recognized support from the USAC primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	Recognition of $3.1 million to be received from the USAC for interstate common line support for a new local access area for which we received ETC status in May 2009 of which $1.7 million was related to services provided during 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Recognition of $1.1 million upon a change in our estimate of support to be received from the USAC for interstate common line support of which $77,000 was related to 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	The FCC order issued in March 2009, the result of which provides uncapped support for all lines served by competitive ETCs for tribal lands or Alaska Native regions retroactive to August 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The issuance of this order allowed us to recognize $810,000 in additional USAC support from August 2008 to December 2008 in 2009 that is included in the revenue increase discussed above.
75679_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	An increase in the number of wireless subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	The increase in wireless revenue was partially off-set by receipt of $2.8 million in July 2008 from the USAC for retroactive interstate common line support at Alaska DigiTel for which revenue was recognized in 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of local access services DLPS lines on our own facilities during 2009 and decreased voice minutes carried.
75679_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	The video Cost of Goods Sold increase is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers, increased rates paid to programmers, increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered over our HD/DVR converter boxes due to the increased number of boxes in service, an increase in digital programming tier subscribers, and the recognition of a $594,000 charge in 2009 to settle a billing issue with a cable programmer.
75679_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	The decrease in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities and the addition of more peering partners for Internet traffic, which was partially offset by an increase in costs due to an increased number of cable modem subscribers.

75679_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	The increase was partially offset by decreased costs due to the June 4, 2008 implementation of the new distribution agreement with AT T Mobility.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	AT T Mobility acquired Dobson, including its Alaska properties, on November 15, 2007.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	In December 2007 we signed an agreement with AT T Mobility that provided for an orderly transition of our wireless customers from the Dobson/AT T network in Alaska to our wireless facilities that we began building in 2008 and substantially completed in 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S2	The agreement required our customers to be on our wireless network by June 30, 2009, but allowed our customers to use the AT T Mobility network for roaming during the transition period.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S3	We started transitioning our customers to our wireless facilities in November 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S4	We successfully migrated all but 200 customers from the AT T Mobility network to our network by the required transition date of June 30, 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S5	The four-year transition period, which expires June 30, 2012, provides us adequate time to replace the Dobson/AT T network in Alaska with our own wireless facilities.
75679_11_ITEM7_P144_S6	Under the agreement, AT T Mobility s obligation to purchase network services from us terminated as of July 1, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	AT T Mobility provided us with a large block of wireless network usage at no charge to facilitate the transition of our customers to our facilities.
75679_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	We will pay for usage in excess of that base transitional amount.
75679_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	Under the previous agreement with Dobson, our margin was fixed.
75679_11_ITEM7_P145_S3	Under the new agreement with AT T Mobility, we will pay for usage in excess of the block of no charge minutes on a per minute basis.
75679_11_ITEM7_P145_S4	The block of wireless network usage at no charge has substantially reduced our wireless product Cost of Goods Sold beginning June 4, 2008 through December 31, 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P145_S5	We expect this block of minutes to expire in the first half of 2012 at which time we expect a material increase to our wireless Cost of Goods Sold estimated at $8.0 million to $10.0 million annually.
75679_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in "Consumer Segment Revenues," which was partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Consumer Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Consumer segment primarily due to an increase in the 2008 segment margin upon which the allocation is based.

75679_11_ITEM7_P152_S1	The voice revenue decrease also resulted from a decrease in our average rate per minute on billable minutes carried for our common carrier customers and the transition of voice traffic to dedicated networks.
75679_11_ITEM7_P152_S2	The average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic and a 3.0% interstate rate decrease mandated by federal law.
75679_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	The decrease in data revenue is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting in IRU operating leases and service agreements replacing data network service agreements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	The increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to increased roaming revenue in 2009 primarily due to the construction of our state-wide GSM network starting in 2008 and the 2008 expansion of our CDMA network.
75679_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to decreased long-distance minutes carried and the movement of more traffic onto our network in lieu of carrying traffic on third party networks.
75679_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	The decrease in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting in IRU operating leases and service agreements replacing data network service agreements and a $585,000 favorable adjustment resulting from a refund of fiber repair costs.
75679_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	The fiber repair costs were originally recognized in the first quarter of 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P156_S2	Due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery of the fiber repair costs, we deferred recognition until collection of the refund was reasonably assured.
75679_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue as described above in "Network Access Segment Revenues," which is partially off-set by decreased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Network Access Segment Cost of Goods Sold and a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Network Access segment primarily due to a decrease in the 2008 segment margin upon which the allocation is based.

75679_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	If one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points, each access point is counted as a subscriber.
75679_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	4 A wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device.
75679_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	The increase in voice revenue is primarily due to increased local access lines in service and a $1.3 million or 109% increase in recognized support from the USAC primarily due to increased local subscribers and the FCC order issued in March 2009, the result of which provides uncapped support for all lines served by competitive ETCs for tribal lands or Alaska Native regions retroactive to August 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	The issuance of this order allowed us to recognize $386,000 in additional USAC support from August 2008 to December 2008 in 2009 that is included in the revenue increase discussed above.
75679_11_ITEM7_P169_S2	The increase in voice revenue was partially off-set by decreased long-distance subscribers and decreased voice minutes carried.
75679_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	The decrease in data revenue is primarily due to a $7.2 million or 19% decrease in managed services project revenue partially off-set by a $1.0 million or 6% increase in Internet revenue primarily due to an increase in cable modem subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	The increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of wireless subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to cost savings resulting from an increase in local access lines in service on our own facilities during 2009 and decreased long-distance billable minutes carried.
75679_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	The decrease in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a $5.7 million or 22% decrease in managed services project Cost of Goods Sold.
75679_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold and adjusted EBITDA represented 8%, 6% and 10% of 2009 consolidated revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, which includes data products only, increased 21% to $44.9 million in 2009 as compared to 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P176_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased circuits purchased by our ConnectMD customers and a $5.3 million increase from our acquisition of Unicom effective June 1, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P176_S2	The increase is partially off-set by a decrease in revenue associated with product sales.
75679_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	Managed Broadband segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $10.3 million in 2008 to $11.1 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the increased revenue partially off-set by a decrease in costs associated with product sales.
75679_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	Regulated Operations segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA represented 4%, 3% and 3% of 2009 consolidated revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	A selected key performance indicator for our Regulated Operations segment follows:
75679_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	Regulated Operations segment revenues increased from $14.3 million in 2008 to $23.8 million in 2009 primarily due to our acquisition of UUI effective June 1, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	Regulated Operations segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $3.1 million in 2008 to $6.1 million in 2009 primarily due to our acquisition of UUI effective June 1, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P183_S0	Regulated Operations segment Adjusted EBITDA was $6.0 million in 2009 and $3.6 million in 2008 primarily due to our acquisition of UUI effective June 1, 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P184_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_11_ITEM7_P185_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $210.3 million in 2008 to $212.7 million in 2009 primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	A $1.1 million increase in lease related expense.
75679_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	The increases were partially off-set by the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	The absence of $1.8 million to terminate a management agreement that was paid in 2008 upon the acquisition of our non-controlling interest in Alaska DigiTel.
75679_11_ITEM7_P189_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 36% in 2009 from 37% in 2008, primarily due to increasing revenue.
75679_11_ITEM7_P190_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense increased 8% to $123.4 million in 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P190_S1	The increase is primarily due to our $322.3 million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during 2008 for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in 2009, and the $182.4 million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2009 for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P190_S2	The increase is partially off-set by a $12.0 million depreciation charge in 2008 to reflect a reduction of the estimated useful life of certain assets that were decommissioned at the end of 2008.
75679_11_ITEM7_P191_S0	Other expense, net of other income, increased 17% to $58.7 million in 2009 primarily due to the following:
75679_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	A $1.9 million increase in interest expense resulting from the 2009 write-off of the original issue discount on our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_11_ITEM7_P193_S0	The interest expense increase is partially off-set by the absence of a $921,000 loss that was recorded in 2008 relating to the fair value change on a derivative instrument.
75679_11_ITEM7_P194_S0	Income tax expense totaled $3.9 million and $1.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P194_S1	Our effective income tax rate increased from 47% in 2008 to 53% in 2009 primarily due to the increase in the amount of permanent differences in 2009 as compared to our pretax net income before income tax expense.
75679_11_ITEM7_P195_S0	Our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our Consumer and Commercial segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities.
75679_11_ITEM7_P196_S0	The standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service utilizing our cable service facilities, encompassing voice, video, and data services, without regard to which services customers purchase.
75679_11_ITEM7_P196_S1	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we had 134,400, 133,900 and 133,400 customer relationships, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P197_S0	The standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary analog video, digital video, high-speed data, and telephony customers, not counting additional outlets.
75679_11_ITEM7_P197_S1	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we had 350,100, 343,200 and 327,200 revenue generating units, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P198_S0	Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_11_ITEM7_P198_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_11_ITEM7_P198_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced.
75679_11_ITEM7_P199_S0	In January 2010 the U.S. Department of Agriculture s RUS approved our wholly-owned subsidiary, UUI's application for an $88.2 million loan/grant combination to extend terrestrial broadband service for the first time to Bristol Bay and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, an area in Alaska roughly the size of the state of North Dakota.
75679_11_ITEM7_P199_S1	Upon completion, TERRA-SW will be able to serve over 9,000 households and over 700 businesses in the 65 covered communities.
75679_11_ITEM7_P199_S2	The project will also be able to serve numerous public/nonprofit/private community anchor institutions and entities, such as regional health care providers, school districts, and other regional and Alaska Native organizations.
75679_11_ITEM7_P200_S0	The RUS award, consisting of a $44.2 million loan and a $44.0 million grant, will be made under the RUS Broadband Initiatives Program established pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
75679_11_ITEM7_P200_S1	The award will fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P201_S0	UUI began construction on TERRA-SW in 2010 and expects to complete the project in 2012 or earlier if possible.
75679_11_ITEM7_P202_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, the state of the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_11_ITEM7_P203_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_11_ITEM7_P203_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_11_ITEM7_P204_S0	Our net cash flows provided by and (used for) operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2010 and 2009, are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_11_ITEM7_P205_S0	The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is due primarily to an increase in operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009, a $12.3 million decrease in accounts receivable that is due to timing of receipt of payments and a $15.0 million contractually required payment made in 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P206_S0	Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures.
75679_11_ITEM7_P206_S1	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_11_ITEM7_P206_S2	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_11_ITEM7_P206_S3	The decrease in cash flows used for investing activities is due primarily to a decrease in spending for property and equipment, including construction in progress in 2010 partially off-set by the final contingent payment of $5.2 million for the Alaska Wireless acquisition.
75679_11_ITEM7_P207_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $96.2 million and $121.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P207_S1	Our capital expenditures decreased in 2010 primarily due to the decreased pace of our wireless network expansion.
75679_11_ITEM7_P207_S2	We expect our 2011 expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations, including construction in progress, to total $145.0 million to $155.0 million, depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2011, and excluding grant funded capital expenditures related to our TERRA-SW project.
75679_11_ITEM7_P208_S0	Net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from borrowings off-set by our debt repayments, payment of debt issuance costs and repurchases of GCI s common stock.
75679_11_ITEM7_P208_S1	Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_11_ITEM7_P208_S2	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI s common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_11_ITEM7_P208_S3	The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities is due to a decrease in long-term debt borrowings in 2010 compared to 2009 and an increase in repurchases of GCI s common stock in 2010 compared to 2009.
75679_11_ITEM7_P209_S0	On January 29, 2010, we replaced our then existing Senior Credit Facility with a new amended Senior Credit Facility that provides a $75.0 million revolving credit facility and that extends the maturity through January 29, 2015.
75679_11_ITEM7_P209_S1	We have a $75.0 million revolving Senior Credit Facility with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.
75679_11_ITEM7_P209_S2	We have $20.0 million in long-term debt and $2.7 million of letters of credit outstanding, which leaves $52.3 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P210_S0	On January 18, 2011, we repaid $5.0 million of our outstanding long-term debt.
75679_11_ITEM7_P210_S1	On February 15 , 2011, and February 25, 2011, we borrowed $8.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, under our amended Senior Credit Facility.
75679_11_ITEM7_P210_S2	After consideration of these transactions, we have $44.3 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
75679_11_ITEM7_P211_S0	We are subject to covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our 2014 and 2019 Notes, amended Senior Credit Facility, RUS loans, and CoBank loans.
75679_11_ITEM7_P211_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_11_ITEM7_P212_S0	GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.
75679_11_ITEM7_P212_S1	Under this program, GCI is currently authorized to make up to $125.5 million of repurchases as of December 31, 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P212_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its stock repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_11_ITEM7_P212_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_11_ITEM7_P213_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010 we repurchased on GCI s behalf 8.0 million shares of GCI common stock at a cost of $80.8 million.
75679_11_ITEM7_P213_S1	All of the shares were retired in 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P213_S2	The common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage, liquidity, company performance, market conditions and subject to continued oversight by GCI s Board of Directors.
75679_11_ITEM7_P213_S3	The repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of SEC Rule 10b-18.
75679_11_ITEM7_P214_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010:
75679_11_ITEM7_P215_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our amended Senior Credit Facility, 2014 and 2019 Notes, Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable.
75679_11_ITEM7_P216_S0	Interest on the amount outstanding under our amended Senior Credit Facility is based on variable rates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P216_S1	We used the current rate paid on the amended Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments.
75679_11_ITEM7_P216_S2	Our 2014 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.6 million through February 2014 and our 2019 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $18.3 million through November 2019.
75679_11_ITEM7_P216_S3	Our Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from 2.0% to 6.8%.
75679_11_ITEM7_P216_S4	For a discussion of our 2014 and 2019 Notes, amended Senior Credit Facility, Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable see note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P217_S0	Capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_11_ITEM7_P217_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see note 12 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P218_S0	Cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling $15.0 million which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P219_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P219_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_11_ITEM7_P220_S0	Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13 addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services ( deliverables ) separately rather than as a combined unit.
75679_11_ITEM7_P220_S1	Specifically, this guidance amends the criteria in Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements , for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P221_S0	This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (a) vendor-specific objective evidence; (b) third-party evidence; or (c) estimates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P221_S1	This guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.
75679_11_ITEM7_P221_S2	In addition, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P222_S0	ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P222_S1	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 is not expected to have a material impact on our statement of operations, financial position or cash flows.
75679_11_ITEM7_P223_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts .
75679_11_ITEM7_P223_S1	Under ASU 2010-28, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative, an entity must assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists.
75679_11_ITEM7_P223_S2	To make that determination, an entity should consider whether there are adverse qualitative factors that could impact the amount of goodwill, including those listed in ASC 350-20-35-30.
75679_11_ITEM7_P223_S3	As a result of the new guidance, an entity can no longer assert that a reporting unit is not required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test because the carrying amount of the reporting unit is zero or negative, despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
75679_11_ITEM7_P224_S0	ASU 2010-28 is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010, with early adoption prohibited.
75679_11_ITEM7_P224_S1	The adoption of ASU 2009-28 is not expected to have a material impact on our statement of operations, financial position or cash flows.
75679_11_ITEM7_P225_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued the ASU 2010-29 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations .
75679_11_ITEM7_P225_S1	ASU 2010-29 specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
75679_11_ITEM7_P225_S2	The amendments in this Update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under Topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
75679_11_ITEM7_P225_S3	The amended guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
75679_11_ITEM7_P226_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-29 is not expected to have a material impact on our statement of operations, financial position or cash flows.
75679_11_ITEM7_P227_S0	Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_11_ITEM7_P227_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_11_ITEM7_P227_S2	The financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_11_ITEM7_P228_S0	Critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_11_ITEM7_P228_S1	Most accounting policies and estimates are not considered by management to be critical.
75679_11_ITEM7_P229_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy or estimate is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P229_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_11_ITEM7_P229_S2	For all of these policies and estimates, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_11_ITEM7_P229_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with GCI s Audit Committee.
75679_11_ITEM7_P230_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the years ended December 31, 2010 are described below.
75679_11_ITEM7_P231_S0	The accounting estimates related to revenues from the high cost, rural health and schools and libraries USF programs are dependent on various inputs including current line counts, the most current rates paid to us, and our assessment of the impact of new FCC regulations, the potential outcome of FCC proceedings and the potential outcome of USAC contract reviews.
75679_11_ITEM7_P231_S1	Some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods.
75679_11_ITEM7_P231_S2	Significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_11_ITEM7_P232_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_11_ITEM7_P232_S1	We also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the USAC for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals, health clinics and school districts.
75679_11_ITEM7_P232_S2	We base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, changes in our collections process, regulatory requirements, and our customers compliance with USAC rules .
75679_11_ITEM7_P232_S3	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
75679_11_ITEM7_P232_S4	If their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings, allowances may be reduced.
75679_11_ITEM7_P232_S5	Such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_11_ITEM7_P233_S0	We had $291.5 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2010 consisting of cable certificates of $191.6 million, goodwill of $73.9 million and wireless licenses of $26.0 million.
75679_11_ITEM7_P233_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.
75679_11_ITEM7_P234_S0	We are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process.
75679_11_ITEM7_P235_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
75679_11_ITEM7_P235_S1	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
75679_11_ITEM7_P235_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_11_ITEM7_P235_S3	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
75679_11_ITEM7_P236_S0	The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
75679_11_ITEM7_P236_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_11_ITEM7_P237_S0	Our cable certificates are our largest indefinite-lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a cable business.
75679_11_ITEM7_P237_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_11_ITEM7_P237_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is primarily from cable system acquisitions.
75679_11_ITEM7_P238_S0	The cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics.
75679_11_ITEM7_P239_S0	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_11_ITEM7_P239_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_11_ITEM7_P239_S2	We use comparable market transactions from recent FCC auctions, as appropriate, and a hypothetical build-up method to value our wireless licenses.
75679_11_ITEM7_P240_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_11_ITEM7_P240_S1	We use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
75679_11_ITEM7_P240_S2	In addition, a market-based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach.
75679_11_ITEM7_P241_S0	The direct discounted cash flow, hypothetical build-up, and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows, discount rate, customer churn, and customer behaviors and attrition.
75679_11_ITEM7_P241_S1	These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge.
75679_11_ITEM7_P242_S0	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.
75679_11_ITEM7_P242_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
75679_11_ITEM7_P242_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P242_S3	Events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces, customer behaviors, change in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, performance compared to peers, material and ongoing negative economic trends, and specific industry or market sector conditions.
75679_11_ITEM7_P243_S0	Our company is operated and managed with two balance sheets, however, our impairment tests must be performed at the reporting unit level, which requires us to allocate our balance sheet.
75679_11_ITEM7_P243_S1	These allocations are subjective and require a significant amount of judgment.
75679_11_ITEM7_P243_S2	Changes to the assumptions and allocation methodologies could significantly change our estimates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P243_S3	We may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results, or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill, cable certificates, and wireless licenses.
75679_11_ITEM7_P244_S0	We have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2010, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between 60% and 853%.
75679_11_ITEM7_P244_S1	The reporting unit that exceeded the book value by 60% passed the goodwill impairment test by $21.4 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_11_ITEM7_P244_S2	We believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
75679_11_ITEM7_P245_S0	Based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2010, the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 204%.
75679_11_ITEM7_P245_S1	The fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by 22% and $42.4 million as of October 31, 2010, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_11_ITEM7_P245_S2	We believe that none of our indefinite lived intangible assets were close to failing the impairment test.
75679_11_ITEM7_P246_S0	We estimate unbilled long-distance and wireless services Cost of Goods Sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates.
75679_11_ITEM7_P246_S1	We estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services, and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers.
75679_11_ITEM7_P246_S2	Carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new, revised or corrected billings.
75679_11_ITEM7_P246_S3	Such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received, payments are made, billing matters are researched and resolved, tariffed billing periods lapse, or when disputed charges are resolved.
75679_11_ITEM7_P246_S4	Revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_11_ITEM7_P247_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P247_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $89.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 1996 to 2010, and that primarily expire from 2011 to 2030, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 to 2010, and that expire in 2024 to 2030, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM7_P247_S2	Pre-acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits.
75679_11_ITEM7_P248_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $1.9 million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire.
75679_11_ITEM7_P248_S1	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_11_ITEM7_P248_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010 based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_11_ITEM7_P248_S3	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_11_ITEM7_P249_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P249_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_11_ITEM7_P250_S0	See Part I Item 1 Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_11_ITEM7_P251_S0	We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes.
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our amended Senior Credit Facility carries interest rate risk.
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Amounts borrowed under this Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 4.00% or less depending upon our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined).
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Should the LIBOR rate change, our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly.
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S5	As of December 31, 2010, we have borrowed $20.0 million subject to interest rate risk.
75679_11_ITEM7A_P0_S6	On this amount, each 1% increase in the LIBOR interest rate would result in $200,000 of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis.
75679_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are filed under this Item, beginning on page 60.
75679_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our supplementary data is filed under Item 7, beginning on page 35.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2010.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO).
75679_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2010, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to a material weakness associated with inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the USF high cost program support revenue accrual.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Our revenue and accounts receivable were corrected prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of our June 30, 2010 quarterly report.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	The impact of this error was deemed to be immaterial in the prior periods.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	In the third quarter of 2010, we began remediation of our inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the USF high cost program support revenue accrual by strengthening the design and operation of our controls over the preparation and review of the accrual.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Specifically, we have replaced and reorganized the staff responsible for the USF high cost support revenue to ensure more focus on our USF high cost support revenue.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	We have reviewed and, as appropriate, changed the accrual preparation and review process for USF high cost support revenue.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Additionally, the updated process has been documented to ensure consistent application.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Our remediation efforts continued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and will continue in 2011.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	As described above in the second quarter of 2010 we identified a material weakness associated with inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the USF high cost program support revenue accrual.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	We began remediation in the third quarter of 2010 by strengthening the design and operation of our controls over the preparation and review of the USF high cost program support revenue accrual.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our remediation efforts continued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and will continue in 2011.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	On November 4, 2010 we implemented a new cable video billing system.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	The implementation of the new system has resulted in certain changes to our processes and procedures affecting internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2010.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P7_S2	We have documented processes and tested internal controls over the new billing system.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Due to the complexities of implementing a new billing system we expect to continue to monitor and evaluate the new system for several months.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P7_S4	We believe we have the processes and appropriate management in place to effectively perform the monitoring and evaluation duties.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-13(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P11_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P11_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P11_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P11_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.

75679_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the date indicated.
75679_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	This Amended and Restated Aircraft Lease Agreement ( Agreement ) is made effective as of February 25, 2005 ( Effective Date ), between GCI Communication Corp., an Alaska corporation ( GCI and Lessee ) and 560 Company, Inc., an Alaska corporation ( Lessor ).
75679_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	WHEREAS, effective as of January 1, 2001, GCI and Lessor entered into an Aircraft Lease Agreement ("Lease") regarding the following-described aircraft ("Citation"):
75679_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	WHEREAS, 560 Company, Inc. is the Lessor and owner of a newly acquired aircraft, together with all equipment and accessories attached thereto or used in connection therewith (collectively, Astra ):
75679_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Now, therefore, Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:
75679_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Location and Use of Aircraft .
75679_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Aircraft shall be under the control of Lessee as of the Effective Date.
75679_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	Lessor hereby grants to Lessee the right to use the Aircraft on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The initial term of this Agreement shall be for thirty (30) days and shall commence on the Effective Date.
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	The lease shall automatically continue on a month to month basis unless terminated pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	Either Lessee or Lessor may terminate this Agreement upon one hundred twenty (120) days written notice as set forth in Section 17, and as follows: If GCI elects to terminate this Agreement, Lessor may within five (5) business days of the date of such notice provide GCI with written notice of Lessor s intent to put the Astra up for sale.
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S3	Then, this Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the later sale date of both Aircraft, or (ii) one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of GCI s termination notice.
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S4	If the Agreement is not terminated within ninety (90) days from the date of GCI s termination notice, then Lessor shall rebate any rental payment for the period after the ninetieth (90) day until the date of the lease termination to GCI on the same date and in addition to the deposit described in Section 3(C).
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S5	Additionally, Lessor shall rebate to GCI all costs GCI incurs hereunder beginning on the ninety-first (91 st ) day after the termination notice.
75679_11_ITEM15_P24_S6	If Lessor fails to give notice of its intent to sell the Aircraft within such five (5) business days, then this Agreement shall terminate ninety (90) days from the date of GCI s written notice of its intent to terminate.
75679_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	GCI shall pay rent to Lessor at the rate of (a) US $50,000.00 per month on the Citation and (b) US $75,000.00 per month on the Astra, "dry" plus sales/use tax if applicable, without demand, offset, deduction or counterclaim.
75679_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	Payments of each month s rental shall be made on or before the first (1st) day of each month, in advance.
75679_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	The monthly rental payment for the first and last month shall be prorated on an actual day's basis, and any unused funds after a proper termination shall be refunded to Lessee in full except as otherwise provided herein.
75679_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	In addition to the monthly payment, GCI previously granted to Lessor an option to purchase two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) shares of General Communication, Inc., Class A Common Stock, no par value, at six and 50/100 dollars ($6.50) per share, in the form set forth as Exhibit A hereto.
75679_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	Lessor may sell to GCI the Stock arising from such option, so long as all proceeds from any such sale are used first to retire the Deposit (defined in Section 3C below).
75679_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	Alternatively, if Lessor desires not to exercise the option, Lessor may surrender the right to purchase all or a portion of the Stock subject to the option agreement to GCI, whereupon the in the money value (calculated by reference to the closing price of the GCI Class A common stock on the day immediately preceding the surrender) of the underlying option Stock surrendered shall be applied first toward repayment of the Deposit, with any remainder paid in cash to 560 Company.
75679_11_ITEM15_P26_S3	Any such sales of Stock, or such application of the in the money value of the Stock, to GCI shall be subject to all the covenants and limitations set forth in GCI and its affiliates debt and preferred stock instruments, both those currently outstanding and any and all subsequently executed.
75679_11_ITEM15_P26_S4	If GCI (or its affiliates) is unable to obtain a waiver of any covenant or restriction that would prohibit such a Stock repurchase, then GCI s obligation to complete such a repurchase shall be waived unless and until such time as a repurchase is permissible.
75679_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	In addition to the above payments, GCI previously provided Lessor with a one million five hundred thousand dollar ($1,500,000.00) deposit for the Aircraft s usage hereunder ( Deposit ).
75679_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Lessor may utilize the Deposit for its general working capital needs.

75679_11_ITEM15_P561_S1	If there is a net decrease in Member nonrecourse debt minimum gain for any Fiscal Year, each Member having a share of such minimum gain will be allocated items of Profits equal to such Member s share of such net decrease in Company nonrecourse debt minimum gain.

75679_11_ITEM15_P562_S0	Allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company for federal income tax purposes for a Fiscal Year will be allocated, as nearly as is practicable, in accordance with the manner in which such items are reflected in the allocations of Profits and Losses among the Members for such Fiscal Year.
75679_11_ITEM15_P562_S1	To the extent possible, principles identical to those that apply to allocations for federal income tax purposes will apply for state and local income tax purposes.
75679_11_ITEM15_P563_S0	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (except Section 5.4, which will be applied first), if in any Fiscal Year or other period a Member unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or Distribution described in the qualified income offset provisions of the 704(b) Regulations, such Member will be specially allocated items of income in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the 704(b) Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Member as quickly as possible.
75679_11_ITEM15_P564_S0	5.7 Limit on Loss Allocations .
75679_11_ITEM15_P565_S0	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.2 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Losses (or items thereof) will not be allocated to a Member if such allocation would cause or increase a Member s Adjusted Capital Account Deficit and will be reallocated to the Members (other than any such Member to which the limitations of this Section 5.7 apply), subject to the limitations of this Section 5.7.
75679_11_ITEM15_P566_S0	To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset under 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts under the 704(b) Regulations, the amount of the adjustment to the Capital Accounts will be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases the basis), and the gain or loss will be specially allocated to the Members in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted under the 704(b) Regulations.
75679_11_ITEM15_P567_S0	All items of gain, loss and deduction with respect to property that is reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Members at a basis different from such property s adjusted tax basis will be allocated, solely for tax purposes, among the Members to take into account the variation between the adjusted tax basis of the property and the basis reflected in the Member s Capital Account according to the principles of the 704(c) Regulations.
75679_11_ITEM15_P567_S1	For example, if there is built-in gain with respect to certain property at the time of such property s contribution to the Company, upon the Company s sale of that property the pre-contribution taxable gain (as subsequently adjusted under the 704(c) Regulations during the period such property was held by the Company) would be allocated to the contributing Member (and such pre-contribution gain would not again create a Capital Account adjustment because the property was credited to Capital Account upon contribution at its Fair Market Value).
75679_11_ITEM15_P567_S2	Except as limited by the following sentence, the allocation of tax items with respect to 704(c) property to Members that do not reflect a basis difference with respect to such property in their Capital Accounts will, to the extent possible, be equal to the allocation of the corresponding book items made to such Members with respect to such property.
75679_11_ITEM15_P567_S3	All tax allocations made under this Section 5.9 will be made in accordance with 704(c) of the Code, and the method of making such allocations will be determined by the Members, acting together.
75679_11_ITEM15_P568_S0	To the extent that the federal income tax basis of an asset is allocated to the Members in accordance with the Regulations promulgated under 46 of the Code, any tax credit attributable to such tax basis will be allocated to the Members in the same ratio as such tax basis.
75679_11_ITEM15_P568_S1	With respect to any other tax credit, to the extent that a Company expenditure gives rise to an allocation of loss or deduction, any tax credit attributable to such expenditure will be allocated to the Members in the same ratio as such loss or deduction.
75679_11_ITEM15_P568_S2	Consistent principles will apply in determining the Members interests in tax credits that arise from taxable or non-taxable receipts of the Company.
75679_11_ITEM15_P568_S3	All allocations of tax credits will be made as of the time such credit arises.
75679_11_ITEM15_P568_S4	Any recapture of a tax credit will be allocated, to the extent possible, to the Members in the same manner as the tax credit was allocated to them.
75679_11_ITEM15_P568_S5	Except as otherwise specifically provided in the 704(b) Regulations (such as the adjustments required when there is an upward or downward adjustment in the tax basis of investment credit property), allocations of tax credits and their recapture will not be reflected by any adjustment to Capital Accounts.
75679_11_ITEM15_P569_S0	In the event any Member has a deficit Capital Account at the end of any Company Fiscal Year that is in excess of the sum of [i] the amount such Member is obligated to restore to the Company pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, [ii] the amount such Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(1) and [iii] the amount such Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, however, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this Article 5 have been tentatively made as if Section 5.6 and this Section 5.11 were not in the Agreement.
75679_11_ITEM15_P570_S0	The allocations set forth in Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.8 and 5.11 (the Regulatory Allocations ) are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations.
75679_11_ITEM15_P570_S1	It is the intent of the Members that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Company income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Section 5.12.
75679_11_ITEM15_P570_S2	Therefore, notwithstanding, any other provision of this Article 5 (other than the Regulatory Allocations), the Board of Managers shall make such offsetting special allocations of Company income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Member s Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part of the Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to Section 5.2.
75679_11_ITEM15_P570_S3	In exercising its discretion under this Section 5.12, the Board of Managers shall take into account any future Regulatory Allocations under Section 5.4 that, although not yet made, are likely to offset Regulatory Allocations made under Section 5.3.
75679_11_ITEM15_P571_S0	If any Unit is Transferred during any Fiscal Year of the Company (whether by liquidation or Transfer of a Unit or otherwise), the books of the Company will be closed as of the effective date of Transfer.
75679_11_ITEM15_P571_S1	The Profits or Losses attributed to the period from the first day of such Fiscal Year through the effective date of Transfer will be allocated to the Transferor and the Profits or Losses attributed to the period commencing on the day after the effective date of Transfer will be allocated to the Transferee.
75679_11_ITEM15_P571_S2	In lieu of an interim closing of the books of the Company and with the agreement of the Transferor and the Transferee, the Company may allocate Profits and Losses for such Fiscal Year between the Transferor and the Transferee based on a daily proration of items for such Fiscal Year or any other reasonable method of allocation (including an allocation of extraordinary Company items, as determined by the Company, based on when such items are recognized for federal income tax purposes).
75679_11_ITEM15_P572_S0	Except for liquidating Distributions under Section 12.3 and except as otherwise provided by Section 6.5, the Company will make all Distributions of Available Cash to the Members in proportion to their Units, without distinction as to class, subject to the limitation that Distributions in respect of Profits Interest Units shall relate only to Profits earned and increases in value of the Company after the date that such Profits Interest Units are issued.
75679_11_ITEM15_P572_S1	Except as provided by Section 6.5, the timing and amount of Distributions shall be determined by the Board of Managers.

75679_11_ITEM15_P574_S0	If required by the Code or by state or local law, the Company will withhold any required amount from Distributions to a Member for payment to the appropriate taxing authority.
75679_11_ITEM15_P574_S1	Any amount so withheld from a Member will be treated as a Distribution by the Company to such Member.
75679_11_ITEM15_P574_S2	Each Member will timely file any agreement that is required by any taxing authority in order to avoid any withholding obligation that otherwise would be imposed on the Company.
75679_11_ITEM15_P575_S0	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company will not make any Distribution to the Members if, after the Distribution, the liabilities of the Company (other than liabilities to Members on account of their Units) would exceed the Fair Market Value of the Company s assets.
75679_11_ITEM15_P575_S1	With respect to any property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited to the specific property, such property will be included in assets only to the extent the property s Fair Market Value exceeds its associated liability, and such liability will be excluded from the Company s liabilities.
75679_11_ITEM15_P575_S2	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company will not make a Distribution to any Member if such Distribution would cause or increase any Member s Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.
75679_11_ITEM15_P576_S0	For each Fiscal Year the Company will, during such Fiscal Year or the immediately subsequent Fiscal Year, but not later than 90 days following the end of each Fiscal Year, to the extent that there is Available Cash distribute to each Member, with respect to such Fiscal Year, a distribution in an amount equal to such Member s Presumed Tax Liability for such Fiscal Year (a Tax Distribution ).
75679_11_ITEM15_P576_S1	Any amount distributed pursuant to this Section 6.5 will be deemed to be an advance distribution of amounts otherwise distributable to the Members pursuant to Sections 6.1 and will reduce the amounts that would subsequently otherwise be distributable to the Members pursuant to such provisions in the order they would otherwise have been distributable.
75679_11_ITEM15_P576_S2	The Board of Managers may distribute Tax Distributions quarterly on an estimated basis prior to the end of a Fiscal Year, but if the amounts so distributed as estimated Tax Distributions exceed the amount of Tax Distributions to which such Member is entitled to for such Fiscal Year, the Member will promptly after the end of the Fiscal Year return such excess to the Company and the excess will be treated as a distribution to such Member pursuant to Section 6.1, as applicable until it is returned.

75679_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	The manage ment platform has the capability to remotely access routers, servers and layer two switches, permitting changes in configuration without the need to be physically located at the service point.
75679_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We own state-wide wireless facilities that cover 98% of the population providing service to urban and rural Alaska communities and we will continue to expand these networks throughout the terrestrially and satellite served portions of Alaska in 2011.
75679_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	We own GSM and CDMA wireless facilities serving urban Alaska locations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Our urban network includes Ericsson and Nortel wireless switches located in Anchorage and 183 cell sites that serve the following areas of Alaska: Anchorage and Eagle River, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Kenai Peninsula, Southeast, Kodiak and Fairbanks.
75679_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our rural network consists of GSM facilities that are located throughout Alaska s rural villages and communities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	We extend our network coverage through roaming arrangements with other GSM and CDMA carriers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	A discussion of competition by product and service in our Consumer segment follows.
75679_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	The long-distance industry is intensely competitive and based upon price and bundling.
75679_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	In the intrastate, interstate and international long-distance market, we compete against AT T Alascom, Inc. ( AT T Alascom ), Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. ( ACS ), MTA, long-distance resellers, and certain smaller rural local telephone companies.
75679_11_ITEM1_P80_S1	AT T Alascom, as a subsidiary of AT T, Inc., has access to greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have.
75679_11_ITEM1_P80_S2	There is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the Alaska market.
75679_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	In addition, wireless and voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	Some consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local and long-distance calling.
75679_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have competed in the long-distance market by offering discounts from rates charged by our competitors and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies.
75679_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	We compete against ACS, the ILEC, in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks and the Kenai Peninsula area; MTA, the ILEC, in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other smaller ILECs in other communities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	In the local telephone services market, the 1996 Telecom Act, judicial decisions, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments, and new technologies have increased the overall likelihood that barriers to local telephone competition will be substantially reduced or removed.
75679_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	These initiatives include requirements that ILECs negotiate with entities, including us, to provide interconnection to the existing local telephone network, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way and to resell services offered by the ILEC.
75679_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	We have been able to obtain interconnection, access and related services from the ILECs, at rates that allow us to offer competitive services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	However, if we are unable to continue to obtain these services and access at acceptable rates, our ability to offer local access services, and our revenues and net income, could be materially adversely affected.
75679_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	To date, we have been successful in capturing a significant portion of the local telephone market in the locations where we are offering these services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P86_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining these customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	We believe that we have certain advantages over ILECs in providing communications services, including awareness by Alaskan customers of the GCI brand name, our facilities-based communications network, and our prior experience in, and knowledge of, the Alaskan market.
75679_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our cable television systems face competition from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals, including direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), digital video over telephone lines, broadband IP-based services, wireless and satellite master antenna television ("SMATV") systems, and from other sources of news, information and entertainment such as Internet services, off-air television broadcast programming, newspapers, movie theaters, live sporting events, interactive computer services, and home video products, including video disks.
75679_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our cable television systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems by other cable television operators and municipally-owned cable systems, and alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals.
75679_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	The extent to which our cable television systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	We believe that the greatest source of potential competition for video services comes from the DBS industry.
75679_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	Two major companies, The DirecTV Group, Inc. and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering nationwide high-power DBS services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P90_S2	The ILECs in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and Ketchikan offer digital video service over telephone lines in limited areas.
75679_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	With the addition of Anchorage local broadcast stations, increased marketing, ILEC and DBS alliances, and emerging technologies creating new opportunities, competition from these sources has increased and will likely continue to increase.
75679_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Competitive forces will be counteracted by offering expanded programming through digital services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Digital delivery technology is being utilized in all of our systems.
75679_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	We have retransmission agreements with Anchorage broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into all our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Other new technologies may become competitive with non-entertainment services that cable television systems can offer.
75679_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	The FCC has authorized television broadcast stations to transmit textual and graphic information useful to both consumers and businesses.
75679_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	The FCC also permits commercial and non-commercial FM stations to use their subcarrier frequencies to provide non-broadcast services including data transmissions.
75679_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	The FCC established an over-the-air interactive video and data service that will permit two-way interaction with commercial and educational programming along with informational and data services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	ILECs and other common carriers also provide facilities for the transmission and distribution to homes and businesses of interactive computer-based services, including the Internet, as well as data and other non-video services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	The FCC has conducted spectrum auctions for licenses to provide PCS, as well as other services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	PCS and other services will enable license holders, including cable operators, to provide voice and data services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	We own a statewide PCS license in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	Cable television systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic cable service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_11_ITEM1_P98_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems.
75679_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the cable industry (such as the public utilities that own certain of the poles on which cable is attached) may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of communication services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our cable services product offerings.
75679_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	Competition is based upon price and pricing plans, service bundles, the types of services offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_11_ITEM1_P101_S2	We compete with other Alaska based Internet providers and domestic, non-Alaska based providers that provide national service coverage.
75679_11_ITEM1_P101_S3	Several of the providers headquartered outside of Alaska have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	With respect to our high-speed cable modem service, ACS and other Alaska telephone service providers are providing competitive high-speed data subscriber line services over their telephone lines in direct competition with our high-speed cable modem service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	Competitive local fixed wireless providers are providing service in certain of our markets as is a national WiMax-based provider in Anchorage with plans for Juneau and Fairbanks.
75679_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	WiMax is a standards-based wireless technology that provides high-throughput broadband connections over long distances.
75679_11_ITEM1_P102_S3	WiMax can be used for a number of applications, including last mile broadband connections, hotspots and cellular backhaul, and high-speed enterprise connectivity for business.
75679_11_ITEM1_P102_S4	DBS providers and others provide wireless high speed Internet service in competition with our high-speed cable modem services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	Niche providers in the industry, both local and national, compete with certain of our Internet service products, such as web hosting, list services and e-mail.
75679_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	We compete against AT T Mobility, LLC ( AT T Mobility ), ACS, MTA, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.
75679_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	Wireless local number portability, which was implemented by the FCC late in 2003, has also increased the level of competition in the industry.
75679_11_ITEM1_P105_S2	Number portability allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, bundled services, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, network coverage and capacity, the type of wireless handsets offered, and the availability of differentiated features and services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Our Consumer segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	Network Access segment revenues for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands ):

75679_11_ITEM1_P113_S1	We terminate northbound message telephone service traffic for several large resellers who do not have facilities of their own in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P113_S2	We also provide origination of southbound calling card, toll-free services, and toll services for interexchange carriers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P113_S3	Services are generally provided pursuant to contracts.
75679_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	Revenues derived from Network Access segment data services and products in 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $61.5 million, $63.9 million, and $71.4 million, respectively, or 9%, 11%, and 12% of our total revenues, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	Data network services include multi-protocol label switching, frame relay, private line and dedicated Internet service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	Revenues derived from Network Access segment wireless services and products in 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $16.7 million, $8.4 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, or 3%, 1%, and 0% of our total revenues, respectively.

75679_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	Our Network Access segment sales and marketing efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of other common carriers we serve, the number of billable minutes of long-distance and wireless traffic we carry over our network and the number of voice and data transmission circuits leased.
75679_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	We sell our voice, data and wireless services primarily through direct contact marketing.
75679_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	Our Network Access segment shares common facilities used for voice, data and wireless services by other segments.
75679_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	You should refer to Consumer Segment Facilities above for additional information.
75679_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	We had no major customer in 2010.
75679_11_ITEM1_P120_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, Verizon was a major customer.
75679_11_ITEM1_P120_S2	Revenues attributed to our major customer during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, totaled $64.5 million and $65.0 million, respectively, or 11% of total revenues for each year.
75679_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	Our Network Access segment competes against AT T Alascom, ACS, and certain smaller rural local telephone carriers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	There is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the Alaska market.
75679_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	Other common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in Alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to our carrier customers by their customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P122_S1	Pricing pressures, new program offerings, revised business plans, and market consolidation continue to evolve in the markets served by our carrier customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P122_S2	If, as a result, their traffic is reduced, or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in Alaska are reduced, our traffic will also likely be reduced, and we may have to respond to competitive pressures.
75679_11_ITEM1_P122_S3	We are unable to predict the effect of such changes on our business.
75679_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	Historically, we have competed in the Network Access segment market by offering rates comparable to or less than our competitors, by providing a comprehensive service model to meet the complete needs of our carrier customers, and by providing responsive customer service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	Network Access segment long-distance and wireless services revenues derived from our other common carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction, commercial fishing, and oil and gas activities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	Our Network Access segment data services do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	We offer a full range of communications services and products to commercial and governmental customers.

75679_11_ITEM1_P166_S0	Our Managed Broadband segment sales and marketing efforts focus on increasing the number of subscribers we serve, selling bundled services, and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	We sell our Managed Broadband segment services and products primarily through direct contact marketing.
75679_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	Our Managed Broadband segment services and products are delivered using a platform including many of the latest advancements in technology through a locally available circuit, our existing lines, and/or satellite earth stations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P167_S1	Our Internet services are partially provisioned over a satellite based digital video broadcast carrier that reduces the requirement for new satellite transponder bandwidth to support growth in ConnectMD , SchoolAccess and other broadband services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	We employ a packet data satellite transmission technology for the efficient transport of broadband data in support of our ConnectMD and SchoolAccess initiatives.
75679_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	Our SchoolAccess Internet service is delivered as follows:
75679_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	In communities where we have terrestrial interconnects or provide existing service over regional earth stations, we have configured intermediate distribution facilities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	In communities or remote locations to which we have not extended communications services, SchoolAccess is provided via a dedicated (usually on premise) very small aperture terminal ("VSAT") satellite station.
75679_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	The VSAT connects to an intermediate distribution facility located in Anchorage.
75679_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	Our facilities include DeltaNet, a long-haul broadband microwave network ringing the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta a region of approximately 50,000 square miles in western Alaska.

75679_11_ITEM1_P171_S2	We utilize DeltaNet to support growth in wireless and broadband services including ConnectMD and SchoolAccess .
75679_11_ITEM1_P172_S0	You should refer to Consumer Segment Facilities above for additional information.
75679_11_ITEM1_P173_S0	There are several competing companies in Alaska that actively sell broadband services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P173_S1	Our ability to provide end-to-end broadband services solutions has allowed us to maintain our market position based on value added services and products rather than solely based on price competition.
75679_11_ITEM1_P173_S2	These services are blended with other transport and software products into unique customer solutions, including SchoolAccess and ConnectMD applications such as video conferencing and unique web content services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P174_S0	Our Managed Broadband segment does not exhibit seasonality.
75679_11_ITEM1_P175_S0	We offer voice and data services and products to commercial and residential customers in 60 rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P175_S1	Regulated Operations segment revenues were $22.7 million, $23.8 million, and $14.3 million in 2010, 2009, and from the June 1, 2008 date of acquisition of UUI and United-KUC, Inc. ( United-KUC ) through December 31, 2008, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM1_P176_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment offers wireline communications services to our residential and commercial customers, including local access and Internet services and products.
75679_11_ITEM1_P177_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve.
75679_11_ITEM1_P177_S1	We sell our Regulated Operations segment services through local media advertising, retail stores, and through our website.
75679_11_ITEM1_P178_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment services are delivered by switching, outside plant, terrestrial microwave, and satellite facilities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P178_S1	Our outside plant is primarily aerial and buried copper and fiber optic cables.
75679_11_ITEM1_P179_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment has no competition for its local access services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P180_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment services do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_11_ITEM1_P181_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, Internet and cable services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_11_ITEM1_P181_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_11_ITEM1_P182_S0	We may undertake activities that, under certain circumstances may affect the environment.
75679_11_ITEM1_P182_S1	Accordingly, they are subject to federal, state, and local regulations designed to preserve or protect the environment.
75679_11_ITEM1_P183_S0	The FCC, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Forest Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service are required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to consider the environmental impact before the commencement of facility construction.
75679_11_ITEM1_P184_S0	We believe that compliance with such regulations has had no material effect on our consolidated operations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P184_S1	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Seattle, Washington, and Warrenton, Oregon.
75679_11_ITEM1_P184_S2	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_11_ITEM1_P184_S3	Some facilities may be on lands that may be subject to state and federal wetland regulation.
75679_11_ITEM1_P185_S0	Uncertainty as to the applicability of environmental regulations is caused in major part by the federal government s decision to consider a change in the definition of wetlands.
75679_11_ITEM1_P185_S1	Most of our facilities are on leased property, and, with respect to all of these facilities, we are unaware of any violations of lease terms or federal, state or local regulations pertaining to preservation or protection of the environment.
75679_11_ITEM1_P186_S0	The engineered routes of our projects to construct terrestrial and undersea fiber optic cable facilities pass over wetlands and other environmentally sensitive areas.
75679_11_ITEM1_P186_S1	We believe our construction methods used for buried cable have a minimal impact on the environment.
75679_11_ITEM1_P186_S2	The agencies, among others, that are involved in permitting and oversight of our cable deployment efforts are the United States Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and the Alaska Office of the Governor-Governmental Coordination.
75679_11_ITEM1_P186_S3	We are unaware of any violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits pertaining to preservation or protection of the environment.
75679_11_ITEM1_P187_S0	In the course of operating our cable television and communications systems, we have used various materials defined as hazardous by applicable governmental regulations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P187_S1	These materials have been used for insect repellent, paint used to mark the location of our facilities, and pole treatment, and as heating fuel, transformer oil, cable cleaner, batteries, diesel fuel, and in various other ways in the operation of those systems.
75679_11_ITEM1_P187_S2	We do not believe that these materials, when used in accordance with manufacturer instructions, pose an unreasonable hazard to those who use them or to the environment.
75679_11_ITEM1_P188_S0	We do not hold patents, franchises or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P188_S1	We do hold registered service marks for the letters GCI , and for the terms SchoolAccess , Alaska United Fiber Optic Cable System , GCI ConnectMD , ConnectMD , GCI Hypernet , My GCI , MyGCI , Keep Talking Alaska , Digiminutes , Unicom , Cell-ID , and United-KUC .
75679_11_ITEM1_P189_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_11_ITEM1_P189_S1	We hold licenses through our subsidiary GCI Communication Corp. for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Consumer, Commercial and Network Access segments.
75679_11_ITEM1_P190_S0	We hold the following licenses, among others:
75679_11_ITEM1_P191_S0	Two licenses for use of a 30 MHz block of spectrum, which together authorize provision of PCS services in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P191_S1	Both licenses have an expiration date of June 23, 2015.
75679_11_ITEM1_P191_S2	Licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_11_ITEM1_P192_S0	A LMDS license which we acquired in 1998 for use of a 150 MHz block of spectrum in the 28 GHz Ka-band for providing wireless services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P193_S0	Several 25 MHz cellular B licenses are held by our subsidiary Unicom for sites located in the Wade Hampton AK-1 portion of CMA 315 and the Bethel AK-2 portion of CMA 316, throughout the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
75679_11_ITEM1_P194_S0	Earth stations are licensed generally for fifteen years.
75679_11_ITEM1_P194_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations (e.g., VSATs).
75679_11_ITEM1_P194_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_11_ITEM1_P195_S0	We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ( RCA ) to provide cable service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_11_ITEM1_P195_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates issued for each community.
75679_11_ITEM1_P195_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_11_ITEM1_P196_S0	Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_11_ITEM1_P196_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_11_ITEM1_P196_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_11_ITEM1_P196_S3	Any change in the Act that loosened regulatory oversight of ILECs control of bottleneck facilities could have an adverse impact on our businesses.
75679_11_ITEM1_P196_S4	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P197_S0	As an Interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P197_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the RCA and the FCC as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P197_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_11_ITEM1_P198_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_11_ITEM1_P199_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_11_ITEM1_P200_S0	Fairbanks and Juneau operating companies, MTA and Ketchikan, in order to achieve the necessary Interconnection Agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_11_ITEM1_P200_S1	In other cases the Interconnection Agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_11_ITEM1_P201_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_11_ITEM1_P201_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P202_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Consumer Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_11_ITEM1_P203_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_11_ITEM1_P204_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_11_ITEM1_P204_S1	On February 8, 2011, the FCC issued its most recent proposal to restructure and possibly reduce interstate access charges.
75679_11_ITEM1_P205_S0	Changes to the interstate access charge regime or introduction of new technologies not subject to access charges could fundamentally change the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_11_ITEM1_P205_S1	In addition, the RCA adopted intrastate access reform, which has not yet been promulgated as final rules.
75679_11_ITEM1_P205_S2	We believe the proposed reduction of intrastate access rates will result in a cost savings to us and does not present a substantial risk.
75679_11_ITEM1_P206_S0	Carriers also pay fees for switched wholesale transport services in and out of Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P206_S1	The rates for such services offered by and to any provider were governed by a federal law that was effective through December 31, 2009.
75679_11_ITEM1_P206_S2	The expiration of the applicable federal law is likely to result in a decrease in the rates for services, which would result in a reduction of revenues.
75679_11_ITEM1_P207_S0	The ability to obtain UNEs is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_11_ITEM1_P207_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be sustained in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rules that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_11_ITEM1_P207_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P207_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_11_ITEM1_P208_S0	Recurring and non-recurring charges for UNE-loops and other UNEs may increase based on the rates adopted in RCA proceedings to establish new Interconnection Agreements or renew existing agreements.
75679_11_ITEM1_P208_S1	These increases could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1_P209_S0	The USF pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETC") to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high-cost areas.
75679_11_ITEM1_P209_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P209_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_11_ITEM1_P210_S0	On May 1, 2008, the FCC issued an order adopting the recommendation of the Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service ( Joint Board ) to impose a state-by-state interim cap on high cost funds to be distributed to competitive ETCs.
75679_11_ITEM1_P210_S1	As part of the revised policy, the FCC adopted a limited exception from the cap for competitive ETCs serving tribal lands or Alaska Native regions.
75679_11_ITEM1_P210_S2	While the operation of the cap has generally reduced the high cost fund amounts available to competitive ETCs as new competitive ETCs are designated and as existing competitive ETCs acquire new customers, providers like us who serve tribal lands or Alaska Native regions were provided some relief.
75679_11_ITEM1_P210_S3	On March 5, 2009, the FCC issued an additional order waiving a previously adopted limitation to the exception, the result of which was to provide uncapped support for all lines served by competitive ETCs for tribal lands or Alaska Native regions during the time the interim cap is in effect.
75679_11_ITEM1_P210_S4	The uncapped support for tribal lands or Alaska Native regions and the cap for all other regions will be in place until the FCC takes action on proposals for long term reform.
75679_11_ITEM1_P211_S0	On March 16, 2010, the FCC staff released the National Broadband Plan, including among its topics a proposal to transition existing USF high cost support from voice to broadband networks over a ten year period.
75679_11_ITEM1_P211_S1	On April 21, 2010, the FCC initiated a proceeding to consider interim and long-term USF reforms, including a five year phase-out of support to competitive ETCs.
75679_11_ITEM1_P212_S0	Proposed Rulemaking to consider adopting reforms to its high cost support program, including, among other things, the proposed competitive ETC phase-out and ways to fund and distribute support for broadband services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P212_S1	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by the reduction of USF support.
75679_11_ITEM1_P213_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_11_ITEM1_P213_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_11_ITEM1_P213_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_11_ITEM1_P214_S0	The 1996 Telecom Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_11_ITEM1_P215_S0	Because cable communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_11_ITEM1_P216_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P216_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P216_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_11_ITEM1_P217_S0	The RCA is also certified under federal law to regulate rates for the Basic Service tier on our cable systems.
75679_11_ITEM1_P217_S1	Under state law, however, cable television service is exempt from regulation unless subscribers petition the RCA.
75679_11_ITEM1_P217_S2	At present, regulation of basic cable rates takes place only in Juneau.
75679_11_ITEM1_P218_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P219_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_11_ITEM1_P220_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P220_S1	The FCC requirement that cable operators carry both the analog and digital programming streams of broadcast television stations while broadcasters are transitioning from analog to digital transmission does not apply to all-digital systems like ours.
75679_11_ITEM1_P220_S2	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P221_S0	Cable System Delivery of Internet Service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P221_S1	The FCC has defined high-speed Internet over cable as an information service not subject to local cable-franchise fees, as cable service may be, or any explicit requirements for open access.
75679_11_ITEM1_P221_S2	The Supreme Court affirmed the FCC s position in a decision issued in 2005.
75679_11_ITEM1_P222_S0	Although there is at present no significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services, this situation may change as cable systems expand their broadband delivery of Internet services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P222_S1	Proposals have been advanced at the FCC and Congress to require cable operators to provide access to unaffiliated Internet service providers and online service providers and to govern the terms under which content providers and applications are delivered by all broadband network operators.
75679_11_ITEM1_P222_S2	If such requirements were imposed on cable operators, it could burden the capacity of cable systems and frustrate our plans for providing expanded Internet access services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P222_S3	These access obligations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1_P223_S0	The FCC mandated, effective July 1, 2007, that all new set-top video navigation devices must segregate the security function from the navigation function.
75679_11_ITEM1_P223_S1	The new devices are more expensive than existing equipment, and compliance would increase our cost of providing cable services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P223_S2	Subject to a waiver granted by the FCC on May 4, 2007, we may continue providing low-cost integrated set-top boxes to consumers to facilitate our all-digital cable networks.
75679_11_ITEM1_P224_S0	On April 21, 2010, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry to consider ways to develop a standardized interface for accessing video content, as an alternative to set-top boxes.
75679_11_ITEM1_P224_S1	Adoption of new rules or standards in this area could affect the manner in which we deliver video products to our customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P224_S2	We do not know if the FCC will propose rules for further consideration.
75679_11_ITEM1_P225_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_11_ITEM1_P225_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_11_ITEM1_P225_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_11_ITEM1_P225_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_11_ITEM1_P225_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA and the FCC has an open rulemaking proceeding to consider application of the federal formula.
75679_11_ITEM1_P225_S5	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any such proceedings.
75679_11_ITEM1_P226_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_11_ITEM1_P226_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_11_ITEM1_P226_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_11_ITEM1_P226_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast program ming.
75679_11_ITEM1_P227_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_11_ITEM1_P228_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the Internet.
75679_11_ITEM1_P228_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_11_ITEM1_P228_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_11_ITEM1_P228_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_11_ITEM1_P229_S0	Although the FCC does not regulate the prices charged by Internet service providers or Internet backbone providers, the vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P229_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and the state level.
75679_11_ITEM1_P229_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_11_ITEM1_P230_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_11_ITEM1_P230_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_11_ITEM1_P231_S0	Recently adopted net neutrality regulations have not yet gone into effect and are subject to court appeals.
75679_11_ITEM1_P231_S1	We are currently assessing the steps required to satisfy the regulations as adopted by the FCC.
75679_11_ITEM1_P231_S2	Further legislative proposals under the banner of net neutrality , if adopted, could interfere with our ability to reasonably manage and invest in our broadband network, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P232_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_11_ITEM1_P232_S1	As a licensee of PCS, LMDS, and other wireless services, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing the PCS and LMDS services (described above).
75679_11_ITEM1_P233_S0	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P234_S0	and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas on towers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P235_S0	We have completed negotiation and the RCA has approved current direct wireless Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_11_ITEM1_P235_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_11_ITEM1_P236_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high-cost areas.
75679_11_ITEM1_P236_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_11_ITEM1_P236_S2	Several wireless carriers, including us, have successfully applied to the RCA for ETC status in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P236_S3	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P236_S4	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_11_ITEM1_P237_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_11_ITEM1_P238_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s communications number and approximate location.
75679_11_ITEM1_P239_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters recently revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_11_ITEM1_P239_S1	We are assessing the application of such parameters in Alaska s relatively low population and rural service areas.
75679_11_ITEM1_P240_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of doing so, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_11_ITEM1_P241_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_11_ITEM1_P241_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_11_ITEM1_P241_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_11_ITEM1_P242_S0	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_11_ITEM1_P242_S1	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P242_S2	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_11_ITEM1_P243_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_11_ITEM1_P243_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to our customers and result in higher costs to our customers.
75679_11_ITEM1_P244_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_11_ITEM1_P244_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_11_ITEM1_P244_S2	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_11_ITEM1_P245_S0	Although we have several agreements to help originate and terminate international toll traffic, we do not have foreign operations or export sales.
75679_11_ITEM1_P245_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the western contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_11_ITEM1_P246_S0	We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on customer-sponsored research activities.
75679_11_ITEM1_P247_S0	We offer voice, data and wireless telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P247_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P248_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries, and in particular oil production, as well as investment earnings, tourism, government, and United States military spending.
75679_11_ITEM1_P248_S1	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us.
75679_11_ITEM1_P249_S0	A significant part of the Alaska economy is the state government.
75679_11_ITEM1_P249_S1	All of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes, leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues for the State of Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P249_S2	The State of Alaska reported in fiscal 2010 that oil revenues supplied 89% of the State's unrestricted revenues.
75679_11_ITEM1_P249_S3	In fiscal 2011 state economists forecast that Alaska s oil revenues will supply 87% of the State s projected unrestricted revenues.
75679_11_ITEM1_P250_S0	The volume of oil transported by the TransAlaska Oil Pipeline System over the past 20 years has been as high as 2.011 million barrels per day in fiscal 1988.
75679_11_ITEM1_P250_S1	Production has been declining over the last several years with an average of 0.644 million barrels produced per day in fiscal 2010.
75679_11_ITEM1_P250_S2	The State forecasts the production rate to decline from 0.616 million barrels produced per day in fiscal 2011 to 0.52 million barrels produced per day in fiscal 2020.
75679_11_ITEM1_P251_S0	Market prices for North Slope oil averaged $74.90 in fiscal 2010 and are forecasted to average $77.96 in fiscal 2011.
75679_11_ITEM1_P251_S1	The closing price per barrel was $111.98 on March 1, 2011.
75679_11_ITEM1_P252_S0	To the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the State s projected prices, the State s projected revenues and deficits will change.
75679_11_ITEM1_P252_S1	The production policy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the State s revenue forecast.
75679_11_ITEM1_P253_S0	Should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed, the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the Prudhoe Bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the State, in general, and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services, and, therefore, on us, in particular.
75679_11_ITEM1_P254_S0	Periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ).
75679_11_ITEM1_P254_S1	The United States Energy Information Agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of ANWR exploration.
75679_11_ITEM1_P255_S0	No assurance can be given that the driving forces in the Alaska economy, and in particular, oil production, will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity.
75679_11_ITEM1_P255_S1	The governor of the State of Alaska and the Alaska legislature continue to evaluate the state s oil tax structure which may also affect the oil production industry in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P256_S0	No assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in Alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market.
75679_11_ITEM1_P257_S0	We are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of North Slope oil on Alaska s economy or on us.
75679_11_ITEM1_P258_S0	Deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the State of Alaska s North Slope to the lower 48 states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies.
75679_11_ITEM1_P259_S0	There are two competing companies that are studying the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline, which depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas.
75679_11_ITEM1_P259_S1	Both of the companies completed an initial open season for shipping bids during 2010.
75679_11_ITEM1_P259_S2	These open seasons were approved by government regulators and submissions are currently under evaluation by involved parties.
75679_11_ITEM1_P260_S0	The State of Alaska maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund ( CBRF ) that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls.
75679_11_ITEM1_P260_S1	If the State s current projections are realized and no surpluses are deposited into the CBRF it is projected that the fund would not be depleted before 2020.
75679_11_ITEM1_P261_S0	The date the CBRF is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil.
75679_11_ITEM1_P261_S1	If the fund is depleted, aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget.
75679_11_ITEM1_P261_S2	The governor of the State of Alaska and the Alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures.
75679_11_ITEM1_P262_S0	We have, since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace, aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market.
75679_11_ITEM1_P262_S1	The customer base in Alaska is limited, however, with a population of approximately 710,000 people.
75679_11_ITEM1_P262_S2	The State of Alaska s population is distributed as follows:
75679_11_ITEM1_P263_S0	The remaining 20% are located in other communities across the State of Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1_P264_S0	We employed 1,655 persons as of December 31, 2010, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_11_ITEM1_P264_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_11_ITEM1_P264_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_11_ITEM1_P265_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications industry.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The traditional dividing lines between long-distance, local access, wireless, Internet and video services are increasingly becoming blurred.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face increasing video services competition from DBS providers.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Each of our business segments also faces the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Item 1 Business Narrative Description of our Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry by, and the rates charged by, commercial mobile radio service providers, except that states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The FCC has initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Changes proposed by the FCC could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operation costs.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement enhanced 911 ("E911") capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The FCC adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects, which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The FCC is also considering changes to its rules regarding environmental protection as related to tower construction, which, if adopted, could make it more difficult to deploy facilities.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Currently, pursuant to Alaska law, the basic cable rates in Juneau are the only rates in Alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority, and the rates in Juneau were reviewed and approved by the RCA in July 2010.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Proposals may be made before Congress and the FCC to mandate cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to Internet service providers.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As of the date of this report, the FCC has declined to impose such requirements.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If the FCC or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems, we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our Internet service offerings.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which cable television systems operate.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in the regulatory environment relating to the Internet access market, including changes in legislation, FCC regulation, judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ILEC or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of the impact of the implementation of current regulations and legislation, unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our ability to enter into the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In some Alaska markets, it also depends on our ability to gain interconnection at economic costs.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Future arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Competition contained in Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high-cost areas.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high-cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This support was 18%, 14%, and 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The FCC has proposed phasing out support for voice services and targeting support to broadband services, as well as phasing out support for competitive ETCs.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, members of Congress have indicated that they may seek enactment of legislation addressing universal service reform, including legislation to limit growth of explicit universal service support funds.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of the loan/grant we obtained to build TERRA-SW and/or we may have to spend considerably more than expected to complete the project.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The TERRA-SW project requires us to construct network facilities in rural areas of Alaska where extensive network facilities have never been built.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our ability to complete the TERRA-SW project will require us to obtain permits from various government agencies as well as construct facilities in rural locations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We will be unable to meet the requirements of the grant if we are unable to obtain necessary construction permits and if we are unable to construct the necessary facilities in the rural locations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Additionally, we may be required to incur significant unplanned costs if we encounter unplanned construction challenges.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	These additional unplanned costs may require us to modify our other network expansion plans so that we may meet the requirements of the grant.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Our inability to meet the requirements of the grant and/or significant cost overruns in the construction of TERRA-SW could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Failure to complete development, testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions, including the current economic downturn in the United States, could negatively affect our business.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	While it is often difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The government has taken various measures in an attempt to help improve the economy, however, we are unable to predict the success or outcome of such programs.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	For these reasons, among others, if the current economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We offer voice, data and wireless communication and video services to customers primarily in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, our growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries, in particular oil production, as well as tourism, and government spending, including substantial amounts for the United States military.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on the demand for communication and cable television services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In addition, the customer base in Alaska is limited.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Alaska has a population of approximately 710,000 people, 54% of whom are located in the Anchorage and Matanuska-Susitna Borough region.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and in other locations in Alaska.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The markets in Alaska for voice, data and wireless communications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Prolonged service interruptions could affect our business.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P44_S5	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability and suffer from adverse publicity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system can result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up on the same spacecraft with multiple backup transponders.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply cable, Internet, DLPS, wireless and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the incurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground transmission lines.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our significant debt could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	On December 31, 2010, we had total debt of $786.7 million.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our debt balance is expected to increase by $44.2 million with the construction of TERRA-SW between 2011 and 2012.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, complete our planned network expansion and to meet other obligations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We expect to incur $44.2 million in additional debt for the construction of TERRA-SW in 2011-2012 and, to meet our capital needs, we may incur additional debt in the future.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S3	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S5	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P60_S6	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous other wireless carriers seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P66_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Additionally, new government regulations on the use of a wireless device while driving may affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Studies have indicated that using wireless devices while driving may impair a driver s attention.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Many state and local legislative bodies have passed or proposed legislation to restrict the use of wireless telephones while driving vehicles.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Concerns over safety and the effect of future legislation, if adopted and enforced in the areas we serve, could limit our ability to market and sell our wireless services.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries allegedly incurred as a result of wireless telephone use while driving could result in adverse publicity and further governmental regulation.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	A significant percentage of GCI s voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 9% of GCI s combined outstanding Class A and class B common stock, representing 20% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI s Board.
75679_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our properties do not lend themselves to description by location of principal units.
75679_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	The majority of our properties are located in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	It is not practicable to allocate our properties to our reportable segments since many of our properties are employed by more than one segment to provide common services and products.
75679_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	Additionally our properties are managed at the consolidated company level rather than at the segment level.
75679_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We lease our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our properties consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.
75679_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	Substantially all of our properties are located on or in leased real property or facilities.
75679_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	Substantially all of our properties secure our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM2_P2_S3	See note 6 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.
75679_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various lawsuits, billing disputes, legal proceedings, and regulatory matters that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business.
75679_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	While the ultimate results of these items cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect at this time for the resolution of them to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	In addition we are involved in the following matters:
75679_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	In September 2008, the FCC's Office of Inspector General ("OIG") initiated an investigation regarding Alaska DigiTel LLC s ( Alaska DigiTel ) compliance with program rules and requirements under the Lifeline Program.
75679_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The request covered the period beginning January 1, 2004 through August 31, 2008 and related to amounts received for Lifeline service.
75679_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	Alaska DigiTel was an Alaska based wireless communications company of which we acquired an 81.9% equity interest on January 2, 2007 and the remaining 18.1% equity interest on August 18, 2008 and was subsequently merged with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries in April 2009.
75679_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Prior to August 18, 2008, our control over the operations of Alaska DigiTel was limited as required by the FCC upon its approval of our initial acquisition completed in January 2007.
75679_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	We responded to this request on behalf of Alaska DigiTel and the GCI companies as affiliates.
75679_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	On January 18, 2011 we reached an agreement with the FCC and the Department of Justice to settle the matter, which required us to contribute $1.6 million to the United States Treasury and granted us a broad release of claims including those under the False Claims Act.
75679_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	In August 2010, a company-owned aircraft was involved in an accident resulting in five fatalities and injuries to the remaining four passengers on board.
75679_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	We had aircraft and liability insurance coverage in effect at the time of the accident.
75679_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2011, all claims paid out have been covered by insurance and were recorded net of these recoveries in our Consolidated Income Statements.
75679_12_ITEM3_P3_S3	While some of the claims have been resolved, we cannot predict the likelihood or nature of the total remaining claims, including environmental remediation, related to the accident.
75679_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	All issued and outstanding shares of GCI, Inc's Class A common stock are held by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	GCI's Class A and Class B common stock are publicly traded.
75679_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	GCI and GCI, Inc. have never paid cash dividends on GCI s common stock, and we have no present intention of doing so.
75679_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	Payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be determined by GCI s Board of Directors in light of our earnings, financial condition and other relevant considerations.
75679_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	Our existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit payment of dividends on common stock, other than stock dividends (see note 6 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information) .
75679_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Computershare is GCI s stock transfer agent and registrar.
75679_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected historical information relating to financial condition and results of operations over the past five years.
75679_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	The Selected Financial Data should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	In the following discussion, GCI, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we, us and our.
75679_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
75679_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables, unbilled revenues, accrual of the USF high cost Remote area program support, share-based compensation, inventory at lower of cost or market, reserve for future customer credits, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, depreciable and amortizable lives of assets, the carrying value of long-lived assets including goodwill, cable certificates and wireless licenses, our effective tax rate, purchase price allocations, the accrual of cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) ("Cost of Goods Sold"), depreciation, and contingencies and litigation.
75679_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
75679_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	See also our Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska in 1997 to affect the issuance of Senior Notes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	GCI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, received through its initial capitalization all ownership interests in subsidiaries previously held by GCI.
75679_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Shares of GCI s Class A common stock are traded on the Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol of GNCMA.
75679_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Shares of GCI s Class B common stock are traded on the Over-the-Counter market.
75679_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Shares of GCI, Inc. s common stock are wholly owned by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	The GCI and GCI, Inc. consolidated financial statements include substantially the same account activity.
75679_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins.
75679_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The national economy continues to see persistent unemployment and slow economic growth and even once stabilized is not expected to return quickly to a period of strong growth.
75679_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Should the national economy deteriorate further, it could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth.
75679_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	We believe the Alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time.
75679_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The State of Alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the short-term.
75679_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	This cash reserve is important for Alaska s economy as the State is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product.
75679_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	The majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the Alaska economy which appears to have weathered the recessionary pressures relatively well to date.
75679_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	Nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the nation s future economic situation may have on us in the future.
75679_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	As part of an agreement signed in December 2007 with AT T Mobility, AT T Mobility has provided to us a large block of wireless network usage at no charge that we use for roaming.
75679_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	This block of minutes expired in January 2012 and we expect our wireless Cost of Goods Sold to increase $4.8 million to $5.3 million before factoring in the impact of 2012 subscriber growth .
75679_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our future wireless Cost of Goods Sold will depend on several factors including: the impact and timing of our wireless network build-out, the pattern of usage by our wireless subscribers, and negotiated rates with our roaming partners.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	As an ETC, we receive support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers ( High Cost Order ).
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The High Cost Order divided support to Alaska between Urban and Remote areas.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	Support for CETCs serving Urban areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau will follow national reforms, capping support per provider per service area as of January 1, 2012, and commencing a five-step phase-down on July 1, 2012.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	In addition to broader reforms, the FCC tailored revisions specifically for CETCs serving Remote Alaska, intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	Support to these locations will be capped and distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S6	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_12_ITEM7_P9_S7	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The High Cost Order Remote and Urban program changes decreased our revenue $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily impacting our Consumer segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The High Cost Order Remote and Urban program changes will decrease our 2012 revenue approximately $4 .0 million as compared to 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	At December 31, 2011, we have $33.1 million and $8.5 million in Remote and Urban high cost accounts receivable, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	In November 2010, Verizon acquired a license for 700 MHz wireless spectrum covering Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We expect Verizon will build an LTE network in 2012 and subsequently they will be an additional competitor where our markets overlap.
75679_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	We cannot predict the potential impact this new competition may have on us in the future.
75679_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (underlying data rounded to the nearest thousand):
75679_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on earnings before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation expense, accretion expense, loss attributable to non-controlling interest and non-cash contribution adjustment ( Adjusted EBITDA ).
75679_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures.
75679_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	In addition, multiples of current or projected EBITDA are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value.

75679_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenues increased 4% from $651.3 million in 2010 to $679.4 million in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Revenue increases in our Consumer, Commercial and Managed Broadband segments were partially offset by decreased revenue in our Network Access and Regulated Operations segments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total Cost of Goods Sold increased 9% from $207.8 million in 2010 to $227.4 million in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Cost of Goods Sold increased in all of our segments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Consumer segment revenue represented 52% of 2011 consolidated revenues.

75679_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Selected key performance indicators for our Consumer segment follow:
75679_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	1 A long-distance subscriber is defined as a customer account that is invoiced a monthly long-distance plan fee or has made a long-distance call during the month.
75679_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	2 A local access line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network.
75679_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	3 A basic subscriber is defined as one basic tier of service delivered to an address or separate subunits thereof regardless of the number of outlets purchased.
75679_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	4 A digital programming tier subscriber is defined as one digital programming tier of service delivered to an address or separate subunits thereof regardless of the number of outlets or digital programming tiers purchased.
75679_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Digital programming tier subscribers are a subset of basic subscribers.
75679_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	5 A high-definition/digital video recorder ("HD/DVR") converter box is defined as one box rented by a digital programming or basic tier subscriber.
75679_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	A digital programming or basic tier subscriber is not required to rent an HD/DVR converter box to receive service.
75679_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	6 Average monthly consumer video revenues divided by the average of consumer basic subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in the period.
75679_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	7 A cable modem subscriber is defined by the purchase of cable modem service regardless of the level of service purchased.
75679_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	If one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points, each access point is counted as a subscriber.
75679_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Cable modem subscribers may also be video basic subscribers though basic cable service is not required to receive cable modem service.
75679_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	8 A wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device.
75679_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	9 Average monthly consumer wireless revenues divided by the average of consumer wireless subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in the period.
75679_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a 19% increase in cable modem revenue to $63.4 million due to increased subscribers, rate increases in May and August 2010 and in May 2011 and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds.
75679_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	As discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the FCC published the High Cost Order in November 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	The High Cost Order Remote and Urban program changes decreased our Consumer Segment Voice revenue $617,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 , and decreased our Consumer Segment Wireless revenue $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	The High Cost Order Remote and Urban program changes will result in decreased Consumer Segment Voice revenue of approximately $1.6 million and decreased Consumer Segment Wireless revenue of approximately $1.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2012 .
75679_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the USAC and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We participate in the Lifeline program and recognized $16.9 million in Consumer Wireless Lifeline program support revenue during the year ended December 31, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	Following are the reforms included in the order that we expect to impact 2012 Consumer Segment Wireless revenue:
75679_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The order adopted on an interim basis a flat rate of $9.25 to replace the support previously available under Tier I through Tier III support mechanisms.
75679_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The replacement support reduces the wireless subscriber per line support $0.75 which we expect will result in a $300,000 reduction in our revenue for the year ending December 31, 2012.
75679_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	The FCC intends to further investigate whether this support amount is reasonable over the long term in further rulemaking.
75679_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The order adopted a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012 to be completed by the end of 2012.
75679_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	We are evaluating this requirement and possible processes and cannot predict whether this new rule will have a material impact on our income statement, financial position or cash flows.
75679_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The increase in video Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers, increased rates paid to programmers and increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered through our HD/DVR converter boxes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	This increase was partially offset by decreased costs due to a decrease in subscribers.
75679_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The wireless Cost of Goods Sold increase is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales and a change in the allocation of network maintenance costs.
75679_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increased wireless handset equipment sale costs are associated with an increased number of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs and an increased number of handsets issued to new customers and those extending their service.
75679_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	The change in allocation of network maintenance costs resulted in an increase to our Consumer segment and a decrease to our Network Access, Commercial and Managed Broadband segments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Consumer Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Consumer segment due to an increase in the 2010 segment margin upon which the selling, general and administrative expense allocation is based and an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	These increases are partially offset by increased revenue as described above in "Consumer Segment Revenues.
75679_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Network access segment revenue represented 16% of 2011 consolidated revenues.
75679_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The components of Network Access segment revenue are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Network Access segment Cost of Goods Sold represented 13% of 2011 consolidated Cost of Goods Sold.

75679_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Selected key performance indicators for our Network Access segment follow:
75679_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a $5.3 million Cost of Goods Sold classification change.
75679_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Prior to 2011 certain Cost of Goods Sold were classified as Network Access segment voice Cost of Goods Sold.
75679_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Beginning in 2011 these Cost of Goods Sold were reclassified to data Cost of Goods Sold for a more accurate presentation.
75679_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	The increase in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to:
75679_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	A $5.3 million Cost of Goods Sold classification change.
75679_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Prior to 2011 certain Cost of Goods Sold were classified as Network Access segment voice Cost of Goods Sold.
75679_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	$1.8 million in Cost of Goods Sold related to special project work.
75679_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue and increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Network Access Segment Cost of Goods Sold.
75679_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	These changes are partially offset by a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Network Access segment primarily due to a decrease in the 2010 segment margin upon which the selling, general and administrative expense allocation is based.
75679_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Commercial segment revenue represented 20% of 2011 consolidated revenues.
75679_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Commercial segment data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.
75679_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The components of Commercial segment revenue are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Commercial segment Cost of Goods Sold represented 29% of 2011 consolidated Cost of Goods Sold.
75679_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The components of Commercial segment Cost of Goods Sold are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Commercial segment Adjusted EBITDA, representing 14% of 2011 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, is as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	Selected key performance indicators for our Commercial segment follow:
75679_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a $5.1 million or 13% increase in managed services project revenue due to special project work.
75679_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of goods Sold is primarily due to the Intrastate Access Reform Act ( Intrastate Access Reform ) which went into effect July 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Intrastate Access Reform eliminated the ILECs ability to bill long distance carriers for certain intrastate line charges.
75679_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	This decrease was partially offset by the absence of a $1.0 million favorable adjustment for refunds from several vendors in 2010.
75679_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	In the course of business we estimate unbilled long-distance services Cost of Goods Sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates.
75679_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received, payments are made, billing matters are researched and resolved, tariffed billing periods lapse, or when disputed charges are resolved.
75679_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The increase in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a $4.7 million or 15% increase in managed services project Cost of Goods Sold related to the increased revenue described above in Commercial Segment Revenues.
75679_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA increase is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in Commercial Segment Revenues.
75679_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	This increase was partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Commercial Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Commercial segment primarily due to an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, Cost of Goods sold and Adjusted EBITDA represented 9%, 7% and 13% of 2011 consolidated revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, which includes data products only, increased 27% to $63.2 million in 2011 as compared to 2010.
75679_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased monthly contract revenue due to increased data network capacity purchased by our ConnectMD and SchoolAccess customers and absence of $1.7 million in denied funding from the USAC for one ConnectMD customer for the funding year July 2008 to June 2009.
75679_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	We received the funding commitment letter, which outlined the denied portion, in the second quarter of 2010.
75679_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	The denial has been appealed to the FCC and we cannot predict the likelihood of success.
75679_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Managed Broadband segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $14.0 million in 2010 to $17.0 million in 2011 primarily due to the increase in data network capacity described above in Managed Broadband Segment Revenues .
75679_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Managed Broadband segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $28.6 million in 2011 primarily due to an increase in revenue as described above in "Managed Broadband Segment Revenues," partially offset by an increase in the Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Managed Broadband Segment Cost of Goods Sold, and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Managed Broadband segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in the consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Regulated Operations segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA represented 3%, 2% and 1% of 2011 consolidated revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	A selected key performance indicator for our Regulated Operations segment follows:
75679_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	1 A local access line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network.
75679_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Regulated Operations segment revenues decreased from $22.7 million in 2010 to $22.0 million in 2011 .
75679_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Regulated Operations segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $4.4 million in 2010 to $5.8 million in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	Beginning July 1, 2011, our Regulated Segment began purchasing access to carry its traffic in certain regions from our Network Access Segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Prior to this the traffic in these regions was carried on its own network plant.
75679_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	Under regulatory accounting these intercompany transactions are not eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Regulated Operations segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 55% to $2.8 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in revenue, an increase in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Regulated Operations Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was recorded in our Regulated Operations segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to non-capitalizable TERRA-SW expenses recorded in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.7 million to $235.5 million in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	Individually significant items contributing to the increase include:
75679_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	A $1.2 million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to absence of settlements which resulted in the release of credit reserves in the third quarter of 2010 .
75679_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	These increases were partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in our company-wide success sharing bonus accrual.
75679_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	The remainder of the increase is comprised of individually insignificant items.
75679_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 35% in 2011 and 2010.
75679_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $372,000 to $125.7 million in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Other expense, net of other income, increased 11% to $77.6 million in 2011 primarily due to a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt.
75679_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	On May 23, 2011, GCI, Inc. , our wholly owned subsidiary, completed an offering of $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all of our outstanding 2014 Notes .
75679_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	This increase was partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in interest expense to $68.3 million.
75679_12_ITEM7_P81_S3	The interest expense decrease is primarily due to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, which have a lower interest rate than the interest rate paid on our 2014 Notes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Income tax expense totaled $7.5 million and $9.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our effective income tax rate increased from 51% in 2010 to 57% in 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	At December 31, 2011, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $311.3 million that will begin expiring in 2019 if not utilized, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.9 million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years.
75679_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $127.6 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 1999 to 2011 and that expire from 2019 to 2031, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2007, and that expire in 2024 through 2027, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 45% to 50% in the year ending December 31, 2012, primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences expected in 2012 as compared to our net income before income tax expense.
75679_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Total revenues increased 9% from $595.8 million in 2009 to $651.3 million in 2010.
75679_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	Revenue increases in our Consumer, Commercial and Managed Broadband segments were partially offset by decreased revenue in our Network Access and Regulated Operations segments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Total Cost of Goods Sold increased 7% from $193.7 million in 2009 to $207.8 million in 2010.
75679_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	Cost of Goods Sold increases in our Consumer, Commercial and Managed Broadband segments were partially offset by decreases in our Network Access and Regulated Operations segments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	Consumer segment revenue represented 53% of 2010 consolidated revenues.
75679_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	The components of Consumer segment revenue are as follow (amounts in thousands):

75679_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	On May 20, 2011, we completed an offering of $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ) at an issue price of 100%.
75679_12_ITEM7_P185_S1	We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all $320.0 million of our senior unsecured notes due 2014 ( 2014 Notes ).
75679_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	In June 2011, GCI Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings ), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Add-On Term Loan Supplement No. 1 ( Supplement No. 1 ) to our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM7_P186_S1	The Supplement No. 1 provided for an additional $25.0 million term loan with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%, payable in accordance with the terms of our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM7_P186_S2	Holdings used $20.0 million of the term loan proceeds to pay down outstanding revolving loans under our Senior Credit Facility, thus increasing availability under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM7_P186_S3	The remaining $5.0 million was used for general corporate purposes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	In July 2011, Holdings entered into an Add-On Term Loan Supplement No. 2 ( Supplement No. 2 ) to our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM7_P187_S1	The Supplement No. 2 provided for an additional $25.0 million term loan with an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%, payable in accordance with the terms of our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM7_P187_S2	Holdings used $15.0 million of the term loan proceeds to pay down outstanding revolving loans under our Senior Credit Facility, thus increasing availability under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM7_P187_S3	The remaining $10.0 million was used for general corporate purposes.
75679_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	On August 30, 2011, we entered into a financing arrangement under the NMTC program that provided $16.5 million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network.
75679_12_ITEM7_P188_S1	When completed, the project, called TERRA-NW, will connect to the TERRA-SW network and provide a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the Internet.
75679_12_ITEM7_P189_S0	In September 2011, the RCA approved our application for a $5.3 million grant to help fund TERRA-NW.
75679_12_ITEM7_P189_S1	The grant was increased to $6.3 million in January 2012.
75679_12_ITEM7_P189_S2	The NMTC arrangement discussed above and this grant award partially fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P189_S3	We plan to fund an additional $12.7 million for TERRA-NW and begin construction in 2012 and expect to complete the project in 2014 or earlier if possible.
75679_12_ITEM7_P190_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_12_ITEM7_P191_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_12_ITEM7_P191_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_12_ITEM7_P192_S0	Our net cash flows provided by and (used for) operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2011 and 2010, are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_12_ITEM7_P193_S0	The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities is due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to timing of receipt of payments .
75679_12_ITEM7_P194_S0	Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures.
75679_12_ITEM7_P194_S1	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_12_ITEM7_P194_S2	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_12_ITEM7_P195_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $177.2 million and $96.2 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P195_S1	Our capital expenditures increased in 2011 primarily due to our TERRA-SW project.
75679_12_ITEM7_P195_S2	We recovered a substantial portion of our TERRA-SW capital expenditures through grant funds and loan draws under our TERRA-SW RUS award.
75679_12_ITEM7_P195_S3	We expect our 2012 expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations, including construction in progress, to total approximately $135.0 million, depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2012.
75679_12_ITEM7_P196_S0	Under our TERRA-SW RUS award, we had total available grant funds of $44.0 million.
75679_12_ITEM7_P196_S1	We have received $35.1 million in grant funds during the year ended December 31, 2011, leaving $8.9 million remaining grant funds available as of December 31, 2011.

75679_12_ITEM7_P197_S0	In 2011, we received $16.5 million in cash from participating in an NMTC financing transaction.
75679_12_ITEM7_P197_S1	The cash is restricted for construction of TERRA-NW.
75679_12_ITEM7_P198_S0	No. 1 and No. 2 under our Senior Credit Facility, borrowing under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility, borrowing under our TERRA-SW RUS loan and an investment by US Bancorp, a non-controlling interest.
75679_12_ITEM7_P198_S1	These proceeds were offset by retirement of our 2014 Notes and repayments under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility, payment of debt issuance costs and repurchases of GCI s common stock.
75679_12_ITEM7_P198_S2	Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_12_ITEM7_P198_S3	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI s common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_12_ITEM7_P199_S0	Our Senior Credit Facility, which at December 31, 2011 includes the Supplements No. 1 and No. 2 as discussed above, includes a $50.0 million term loan and a $75.0 million revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.
75679_12_ITEM7_P199_S1	The term loan is fully drawn and a total of $60.0 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P199_S2	Under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility, we have borrowed $10.0 million and have $349,000 of letters of credit outstanding, which leaves $64.7 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2011.

75679_12_ITEM7_P200_S2	On January 23, 2012, we received an additional $1.1 million under the loan portion of the award.
75679_12_ITEM7_P200_S3	After consideration of this transaction, we have $7.9 million remaining loan funds available.
75679_12_ITEM7_P201_S0	We are subject to covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our 2019 and 2021 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, RUS loans, and CoBank loans.
75679_12_ITEM7_P201_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_12_ITEM7_P202_S0	GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.
75679_12_ITEM7_P202_S1	Under this program, GCI is currently authorized to make up to $92.9 million of repurchases as of December 31, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P202_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its stock repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_12_ITEM7_P202_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_12_ITEM7_P203_S0	During 2011 we repurchased, on GCI s behalf, 5.2 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $52.6 million.
75679_12_ITEM7_P203_S1	The common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage, liquidity, company performance, market conditions and subject to continued oversight by GCI s Board of Directors.
75679_12_ITEM7_P203_S2	The open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of SEC Rule 10b-18.
75679_12_ITEM7_P204_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (amounts in thousands):
75679_12_ITEM7_P205_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our Senior Credit Facility, 2019 and 2021 Notes, Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable.
75679_12_ITEM7_P206_S0	Interest on the amount outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility is based on variable rates.
75679_12_ITEM7_P206_S1	We used the current rate paid on the Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P206_S2	Our 2019 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $18.3 million through November 2019 and our 2021 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.0 million through June 2021 .
75679_12_ITEM7_P206_S3	Our Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from 2.0% to 6.8%.
75679_12_ITEM7_P206_S4	For a discussion of our 2019 and 2021 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable see note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P207_S0	Capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_12_ITEM7_P207_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see note 13 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P208_S0	Cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling $15.0 million which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P209_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P209_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_12_ITEM7_P210_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).
75679_12_ITEM7_P210_S1	The amendments in this update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
75679_12_ITEM7_P210_S2	Under these amendments, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
75679_12_ITEM7_P210_S3	The amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P210_S4	This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P211_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 is not expected to have a material impact on our income statements, financial position or cash flows.
75679_12_ITEM7_P212_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) which amends current guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in GAAP and IFRS.
75679_12_ITEM7_P212_S1	The amendments generally represent clarification of FASB ASC Topic 820, but also include instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed.
75679_12_ITEM7_P212_S2	This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM7_P213_S0	The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to have a material impact on our income statements, financial position or cash flows.
75679_12_ITEM7_P214_S0	Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_12_ITEM7_P214_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_12_ITEM7_P214_S2	The financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_12_ITEM7_P215_S0	Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_12_ITEM7_P215_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_12_ITEM7_P216_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P216_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_12_ITEM7_P216_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P216_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI s Audit Committee.
75679_12_ITEM7_P217_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2011 are described below.
75679_12_ITEM7_P218_S0	The accounting estimates related to revenues from the Remote high cost, rural health and schools and libraries USF programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap, our assessment of the impact of new FCC regulations, the potential outcome of FCC proceedings and the potential outcome of USAC contract reviews.
75679_12_ITEM7_P218_S1	Some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods.
75679_12_ITEM7_P218_S2	Significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_12_ITEM7_P219_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_12_ITEM7_P219_S1	We also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the USAC for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals, health clinics and school districts.
75679_12_ITEM7_P219_S2	We base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, changes in our collections process, regulatory requirements, and our customers compliance with USAC rules .
75679_12_ITEM7_P219_S3	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
75679_12_ITEM7_P219_S4	If their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings, allowances may be reduced.
75679_12_ITEM7_P219_S5	Such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_12_ITEM7_P220_S0	We had $292.5 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2011 consisting of cable certificates of $191.6 million, goodwill of $74.9 million and wireless licenses of $26.0 million.
75679_12_ITEM7_P220_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.
75679_12_ITEM7_P221_S0	We are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process.
75679_12_ITEM7_P222_S0	The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
75679_12_ITEM7_P222_S1	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
75679_12_ITEM7_P222_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_12_ITEM7_P222_S3	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
75679_12_ITEM7_P223_S0	The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
75679_12_ITEM7_P223_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_12_ITEM7_P224_S0	Our cable certificates are our largest indefinite-lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a cable business.
75679_12_ITEM7_P224_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_12_ITEM7_P224_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is primarily from cable system acquisitions.
75679_12_ITEM7_P225_S0	The cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics.
75679_12_ITEM7_P226_S0	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_12_ITEM7_P226_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_12_ITEM7_P226_S2	We use comparable market transactions from recent FCC auctions, as appropriate, and a hypothetical build-up method to value our wireless licenses.
75679_12_ITEM7_P227_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_12_ITEM7_P227_S1	We use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
75679_12_ITEM7_P227_S2	In addition, a market-based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach.
75679_12_ITEM7_P228_S0	The direct discounted cash flow, hypothetical build-up, and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows, discount rate, customer churn, and customer behaviors and attrition.
75679_12_ITEM7_P228_S1	These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge.
75679_12_ITEM7_P229_S0	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.
75679_12_ITEM7_P229_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
75679_12_ITEM7_P229_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
75679_12_ITEM7_P229_S3	Events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces, customer behaviors, change in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, performance compared to peers, material and ongoing negative economic trends, and specific industry or market sector conditions.
75679_12_ITEM7_P230_S0	Our company is operated and managed with two balance sheets, however, our impairment tests must be performed at the reporting unit level, which requires us to allocate one of our balance sheets .
75679_12_ITEM7_P230_S1	These allocations are subjective and require a significant amount of judgment.
75679_12_ITEM7_P230_S2	Changes to the assumptions and allocation methodologies could significantly change our estimates.
75679_12_ITEM7_P230_S3	We may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions, expected future operating results, or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill, cable certificates, and wireless licenses.
75679_12_ITEM7_P231_S0	We have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2011, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between 20% and 1,033%.
75679_12_ITEM7_P231_S1	The reporting unit that exceeded the book value by 20% passed the goodwill impairment test by $6.7 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_12_ITEM7_P231_S2	We believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
75679_12_ITEM7_P232_S0	Based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2011, the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 54% and $14.0 million, which we believe is a large margin .
75679_12_ITEM7_P232_S1	The fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by 4% and $7.4 million as of October 31, 2011 .
75679_12_ITEM7_P232_S2	The fair values of our wireless licenses and cable certificates were negatively affected by the FCC s issuance of the High Cost Order discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as it decreased current and forecasted wireless and local services revenue.
75679_12_ITEM7_P232_S3	The wireless revenue decreases affected wireless licenses and the local services revenue decreases affected cable certificates as our local customers are mainly serviced using our cable plant.
75679_12_ITEM7_P232_S4	We believe that none of our indefinite lived intangible assets were close to failing the impairment test, however, as discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway at the FCC.
75679_12_ITEM7_P232_S5	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on us, but our revenue for providing wireless and local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_12_ITEM7_P233_S0	We estimate unbilled long-distance and wireless services Cost of Goods Sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates.
75679_12_ITEM7_P233_S1	We estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services, and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers.
75679_12_ITEM7_P233_S2	Carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new, revised or corrected billings.
75679_12_ITEM7_P233_S3	Such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received, payments are made, billing matters are researched and resolved, tariffed billing periods lapse, or when disputed charges are resolved.
75679_12_ITEM7_P233_S4	Revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_12_ITEM7_P234_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P234_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $127.6 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 1999 to 2011, and that primarily expire from 2019 to 2031, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 to 2007, and that expire in 2024 to 2027, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM7_P234_S2	Pre-acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits.
75679_12_ITEM7_P235_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $1.9 million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire.
75679_12_ITEM7_P235_S1	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_12_ITEM7_P235_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_12_ITEM7_P235_S3	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_12_ITEM7_P236_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P236_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_12_ITEM7_P237_S0	See Part I Item 1 Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_12_ITEM7_P238_S0	We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our Senior Credit Facility carries interest rate risk.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Amounts borrowed under this Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 4.0% or less depending upon our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined) for the revolving portion and LIBOR plus 2.5% for the term portion.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Should the LIBOR rate change, our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we have borrowed $60.0 million subject to interest rate risk.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	On this amount, each 1% increase in the LIBOR interest rate would result in $600,000 of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	All of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate.
75679_12_ITEM7A_P0_S7	We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.
75679_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are filed under this Item, beginning on page 64.
75679_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our supplementary data is filed under Item 7, beginning on page 36.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO).
75679_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2011, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	In the second quarter of 2010 we identified a material weakness associated with inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the USF high cost program support revenue accrual.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	We began remediation in the third quarter of 2010 by strengthening the design and operation of our controls over the preparation and review of the USF high cost program support revenue accrual.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our remediation efforts continued in 2010 and 2011.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P4_S3	At December 31, 2011, we believe we have the appropriate controls designed and these controls are operating effectively.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-13(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P7_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P7_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.

75679_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	Also refer to note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
75679_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues.
75679_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We offer facilities-based local and long-distance voice services, wireless telephone services, video services, data and Internet access to residential and business customers across the state under our GCI brand.
75679_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
75679_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	We benefit from the attractive demographic and economic characteristics of Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Since GCI s founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	As of December 31, 2011, our cable systems passed 79% of Alaska s households, and we have achieved 52% basic cable penetration of the homes we reach.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	We believe we offer superior video services relative to direct broadcast satellite ( DBS ), which is limited by Alaska s geographic location, challenging climate and terrain features.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	At December 31, 2011, 80% of the local access lines we served were carried on our own last mile facilities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S5	In recent years, we expanded our efforts in wireless and presently operate the only statewide wireless network.
75679_12_ITEM1_P9_S6	Our network provides access for both global system for mobile communications ( GSM ) and code division multiple access ( CDMA ) based devices, and fourth generation HSPA+ based wireless communications.
75679_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Consumer segment serves residential customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our Network Access segment serves other common carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	Our Commercial segment serves small businesses, local, national and global businesses, governmental entities, and public and private educational institutions.
75679_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our Managed Broadband segment serves rural school districts, hospitals and health clinics.
75679_12_ITEM1_P10_S4	The financial results of the long-distance, local access and Internet services sold to consumer and commercial customers that we serve in the Bethel, Alaska area are reported in the Regulated Operations segment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated consolidated revenues of $679.4 million.
75679_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We ended the period with approximately 87,900 long-distance customers, 138,100 local access lines in service, 142,600 basic video subscribers, 139,900 wireless subscribers and 119,400 cable modem subscribers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	In January 2010 the U.S. Department of Agriculture s Rural Utilities Service ( RUS ) approved our wholly owned subsidiary, United Utilities, Inc. s ( UUI ) application for an $88.2 million loan/grant combination to extend terrestrial broadband service for the first time to Bristol Bay and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, an area in Alaska roughly the size of the state of North Dakota.
75679_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	UUI began construction on TERRA-SW in 2010 and began offering service on this new facility on December 30, 2011.
75679_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	TERRA-SW is now able to serve over 9,000 households and over 700 businesses in the 65 covered communities, as well as numerous public/non-profit/private community anchor institutions and entities, such as regional health care providers, school districts, and other regional and Alaska Native organizations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	In August 2011, we entered into a financing arrangement under the New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC ) program that provided $16.5 million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network.
75679_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	When completed, the project, called TERRA-NW, will connect to the TERRA-SW network and provide a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the Internet.
75679_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	In September 2011, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ( RCA ) approved our application for a $5.3 million grant to help fund TERRA-NW.
75679_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	The grant was increased to $6.3 million in January 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	The NMTC arrangement discussed above and this grant award partially fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	We plan to fund an additional $12.7 million for TERRA-NW and begin construction in 2012 and expect to complete the project in 2014 or earlier if possible.
75679_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	On July 1, 2011, changes to the intrastate access charge regime published by the RCA went into effect.
75679_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	These changes generally shifted revenue to incumbent local exchange carriers ( ILECs ) for transport of intrastate traffic from long distance carriers to the end-user customers through an increase in fees collected by regulated pools.
75679_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Universal Service Fund High Cost Support.
75679_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	On November 29, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing Universal Service Fund ("USF") high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	serving areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau will follow national reforms, capping support per provider per service area as of January 1, 2012, and commencing a five-step phase-down on July 1, 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	In addition to broader reforms, the FCC tailored revisions specifically for CETCs serving Remote Alaska, intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P16_S4	Support to these locations will be capped and distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_12_ITEM1_P16_S5	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We intend to continue to increase revenues using the following strategies:
75679_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	We offer innovative service bundles to meet the needs of our consumer and commercial customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that bundling our services significantly improves customer retention, increases revenue per customer and reduces customer acquisition expenses.
75679_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our experience indicates that our bundled customers are significantly less likely to churn, and we experience less price erosion when we effectively combine our offerings.

75679_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	The combination of our Alaska United East, Alaska United West and Alaska United Southeast systems provides us with the ability to provide fully protected geographically diverse routing of service between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
75679_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our Alaska United Northwest self-constructed terrestrial fiber optic cable system connects Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska along the Parks Highway corridor and we own a terrestrial fiber optic cable system that extends from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to Valdez, Alaska via Fairbanks, Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	We have indefeasible rights to use ("IRU") capacity in the Kodiak-Kenai Cable Company, LLC s undersea fiber optic cable system linking Anchorage to Kenai, Homer, Kodiak, Narrow Cape on Kodiak Island, and Seward, Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	We serve many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications.
75679_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up on alternate spacecraft with multiple backup transponders.
75679_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	The primary spacecraft we use to provide voice, data and Internet services to our rural Alaska customers are Intelsat s Galaxy 18 for C-band and Intelsat's Horizons 1 for Ku-band, but we also lease capacity on two other spacecraft, SES Americom s AMC-7 and AMC-8.
75679_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	We also lease one 36 MHz transponder on SES Americom's AMC-7 spacecraft.
75679_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	We use this transponder to distribute multi-channel, digitally encoded video programming and services to remote locations within Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	We may use this transponder along with four others that we reserve on AMC-7 to restore service during any fiber outage that may occur in our network.
75679_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	We operate digital microwave systems to link Anchorage with the Kenai Peninsula, our Prudhoe Bay Earth Station with Deadhorse, Alaska, and to link Bethel, Alaska with 40 rural communities.

75679_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	The Eagle River earth station is linked to the Anchorage distribution center by fiber optic facilities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	We use a synchronous optical network ("SONET") as a service delivery method for our terrestrial metropolitan area networks and long-haul terrestrial and undersea fiber optic cable systems.
75679_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	A fiber optic cable system from our Anchorage distribution center connects to the Matanuska Telephone Association ( MTA ), Eagle River central office and to our major hub earth station in Eagle River.
75679_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	We have digital microwave and fiber IRU facilities serving the Kenai Peninsula communities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	We maintain earth stations in Fairbanks (connected via SONET fiber facilities), Anchorage (Benson earth station), and in Prudhoe Bay and Bethel as fiber network restoration earth stations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	Our Benson earth station also uplinks our statewide video service; such service may be pre-empted if earth station capacity is needed to restore our fiber network between Anchorage and Prudhoe Bay, and Anchorage and TERRA-SW communities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	We use our demand assigned multiple access ("DAMA") facilities to serve 69 additional locations throughout Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	DAMA is a digital satellite earth station technology that allows calls to be made between remote villages using only one satellite hop, thereby reducing satellite delay and capacity requirements while improving quality.
75679_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition, 54 (for a total of 123) C-band facilities provide dedicated Internet access and private network services to rural public schools, hospitals, health clinics, and natural resource development industries throughout Alaska.

75679_12_ITEM1_P71_S4	All of our cable systems are completely digital.
75679_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	We provide access to the Internet using a platform that includes many of the latest advancements in technology.
75679_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	The physical platform is concentrated in Anchorage and is extended into many remote areas of the state.
75679_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	Our Internet platform includes the following:
75679_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our Anchorage facility consists of routers, a bank of servers that perform support and application functions, database servers providing authentication and user demographic data, layer 2 and layer 3 gigabit and 10 gigabit switch networks for intercommunications and broadband services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol ("IP") data services are delivered to routers located at the multiple service points throughout our service area.
75679_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	Our Internet management platform constantly monitors these routers and continual communications are maintained with all of the core and distribution devices in the network.
75679_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.
75679_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	The manage ment platform has the capability to remotely access routers, servers and layer two switches, permitting changes in configuration without the need to be physically located at the service point.
75679_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	We own statewide wireless facilities that cover 98% of the population providing service to urban and rural Alaska communities and we will continue to expand these networks throughout the terrestrially and satellite served portions of Alaska in 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	We own GSM/HSPA+ and CDMA/EVDO wireless facilities serving urban Alaska locations.

75679_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our rural network consists of GSM facilities that are located throughout Alaska s rural villages and communities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	We extend our network coverage through roaming arrangements with other GSM and CDMA carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	A discussion of competition by product and service in our Consumer segment follows.
75679_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	The long-distance industry is intensely competitive and based upon price and bundling.
75679_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	In the intrastate, interstate and international long-distance market, we compete against AT T Alascom, Inc. ( AT T Alascom ), Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. ( ACS ), MTA, long-distance resellers, and certain smaller rural local telephone companies.
75679_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	AT T Alascom, as a subsidiary of AT T, Inc., has access to greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have.
75679_12_ITEM1_P80_S2	There is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the Alaska market.
75679_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	In addition, wireless and voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	Some consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for long-distance calling.
75679_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have competed in the long-distance market by offering discounts from rates charged by our competitors and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies.
75679_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	We compete against ACS, the ILEC in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks and the Kenai Peninsula area; MTA, the ILEC in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other smaller ILECs in other communities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	In the local telephone services market, the 1996 Telecom Act, judicial decisions, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments, and new technologies have increased the overall likelihood that barriers to local telephone competition will be substantially reduced or removed.
75679_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	These initiatives include requirements that ILECs negotiate with entities, including us, to provide interconnection to the existing local telephone network, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way and to resell services offered by the ILEC.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	We have been able to obtain interconnection, access and related services from the ILECs, at rates that allow us to offer competitive services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	However, if we are unable to continue to obtain these services and access at acceptable rates, our ability to offer local access services, and our revenues and net income, could be materially adversely affected.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S2	To date, we have been successful in capturing a significant portion of the local telephone market in the locations where we are offering these services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining these customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S4	In addition, wireless and VoIP services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S5	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P86_S6	Some consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	We believe that we have certain advantages over ILECs in providing communications services, including awareness by Alaskan customers of the GCI brand name, our facilities-based communications network, and our prior experience in, and knowledge of, the Alaskan market.
75679_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	Our video systems face competition from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals, including DBS, digital video over telephone lines, broadband IP-based services, wireless and satellite master antenna television ("SMATV") systems, and from other sources of news, information and entertainment such as Internet services, off-air television broadcast programming, newspapers, movie theaters, live sporting events, interactive computer services, and home video products, including video disks.
75679_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems by other cable television operators and municipally-owned cable systems, and alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals.
75679_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	We believe that the greatest source of potential competition for video services comes from the DBS industry.
75679_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	Two major companies, DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering nationwide high-power DBS services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P90_S2	The ILECs in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and Ketchikan offer digital video service over telephone lines in limited areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P90_S3	Their product offerings and price points are similar to our product offerings.
75679_12_ITEM1_P90_S4	With the addition of Anchorage local broadcast stations, increased marketing, ILEC and DBS alliances, and emerging technologies creating new opportunities, competition from these sources has increased and will likely continue to increase.
75679_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	Competitive forces will be counteracted by offering expanded programming through digital services.

75679_12_ITEM1_P177_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Regulated Operations segment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P178_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment offers wireline communications services , including local access and long-distance, and Internet services and products, to our residential and commercial customers in 60 rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P179_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve.
75679_12_ITEM1_P179_S1	We sell our Regulated Operations segment services through local media advertising, retail stores, and through our website.
75679_12_ITEM1_P180_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment services are delivered by switching, outside plant, terrestrial microwave, and satellite facilities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P180_S1	Our outside plant is primarily aerial and buried copper and fiber optic cables.
75679_12_ITEM1_P181_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment has no competition for its local access services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P182_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment services do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_12_ITEM1_P183_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, Internet and cable services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_12_ITEM1_P183_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_12_ITEM1_P184_S0	We may undertake activities that, under certain circumstances, may affect the environment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P184_S1	Accordingly, they are subject to federal, state, and local regulations designed to preserve or protect the environment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P185_S0	The FCC, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Forest Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service are required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to consider the environmental impact before the commencement of facility construction.
75679_12_ITEM1_P186_S0	We believe that compliance with such regulations has had no material effect on our consolidated operations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P186_S1	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Seattle, Washington, and Warrenton, Oregon.
75679_12_ITEM1_P186_S2	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_12_ITEM1_P186_S3	Some facilities may be on lands that may be subject to state and federal wetland regulation.
75679_12_ITEM1_P187_S0	Uncertainty as to the applicability of environmental regulations is caused in major part by the federal government s decision to consider a change in the definition of wetlands.
75679_12_ITEM1_P187_S1	Most of our facilities are on leased property, and, with respect to all of these facilities, we are unaware of any violations of lease terms or federal, state or local regulations pertaining to preservation or protection of the environment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P188_S0	The engineered routes of our projects to construct terrestrial and undersea fiber optic cable facilities pass over wetlands and other environmentally sensitive areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P188_S1	We believe our construction methods used for buried cable have a minimal impact on the environment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P188_S2	The agencies, among others, that are involved in permitting and oversight of our cable deployment efforts are the United States Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and the Alaska Office of the Governor-Governmental Coordination.
75679_12_ITEM1_P188_S3	We are unaware of any violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits pertaining to preservation or protection of the environment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P189_S0	In the course of operating our cable television and communications systems, we have used various materials defined as hazardous by applicable governmental regulations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P189_S1	These materials have been used for insect repellent, paint used to mark the location of our facilities, and pole treatment, and as heating fuel, transformer oil, cable cleaner, batteries, diesel fuel, and in various other ways in the operation of those systems.
75679_12_ITEM1_P189_S2	We do not believe that these materials, when used in accordance with manufacturer instructions, pose an unreasonable hazard to those who use them or to the environment.
75679_12_ITEM1_P190_S0	We do not hold patents, franchises or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P190_S1	We do hold registered service marks, used by each of our reportable segments, for the letters GCI , and for the terms SchoolAccess , Alaska United Fiber Optic Cable System , GCI ConnectMD , ConnectMD , GCI Hypernet , My GCI , MyGCI , Keep Talking Alaska , Digiminutes , Unicom , Cell-ID , and United-KUC .
75679_12_ITEM1_P191_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_12_ITEM1_P192_S0	We hold licenses through our subsidiary GCI Communication Corp. ( GCICC ) for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Consumer, Commercial and Network Access segments.
75679_12_ITEM1_P193_S0	We hold the following licenses, among others:
75679_12_ITEM1_P194_S0	Two licenses for use of a 30 MHz block of spectrum, which together authorize provision of PCS services in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P194_S1	Both licenses have an expiration date of June 23, 2015.
75679_12_ITEM1_P194_S2	Licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_12_ITEM1_P195_S0	A local multipoint distribution system ("LMDS") license which we acquired in 1998 for use of a 150 MHz block of spectrum in the 28 GHz Ka-band for providing wireless services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P195_S1	The LMDS license was renewed in 2008 for an additional 10-year term, following the grant of an extension until June 1, 2012 of the requirement to provide substantial service in the service region.
75679_12_ITEM1_P195_S2	The commercial availability of equipment to illuminate this spectrum remains a challenge, and the prospects for renewal at this time are uncertain.
75679_12_ITEM1_P196_S0	Several 25 MHz cellular B licenses are held by our subsidiary Unicom for sites located in the Wade Hampton AK-1 portion of CMA 315 and the Bethel AK-2 portion of CMA 316, and operated by GCICC pursuant to a de facto long-term spectrum lease.
75679_12_ITEM1_P197_S0	Earth stations are licensed generally for fifteen years.
75679_12_ITEM1_P197_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations (e.g., VSATs).
75679_12_ITEM1_P197_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_12_ITEM1_P198_S0	We are certified through the RCA to provide cable service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_12_ITEM1_P198_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates issued for each community.
75679_12_ITEM1_P198_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_12_ITEM1_P199_S0	Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_12_ITEM1_P199_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_12_ITEM1_P199_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_12_ITEM1_P199_S3	Any change in the Act that loosened regulatory oversight of ILECs control of bottleneck facilities could have an adverse impact on our businesses.
75679_12_ITEM1_P199_S4	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P200_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P200_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the RCA and the FCC as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P200_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_12_ITEM1_P201_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_12_ITEM1_P202_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_12_ITEM1_P202_S1	We have had to participate in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs, including ACS for its Fairbanks and Juneau operating companies, MTA and Ketchikan, in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_12_ITEM1_P202_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_12_ITEM1_P203_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_12_ITEM1_P203_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P204_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Consumer Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_12_ITEM1_P205_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_12_ITEM1_P206_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_12_ITEM1_P206_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_12_ITEM1_P206_S2	We do not anticipate that these changes, which will begin implementation starting in 2012, will have a material impact, except that the reduction of interstate access rates generally will result in a cost savings on access charges to us.
75679_12_ITEM1_P206_S3	However, the details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology will be addressed over the coming year, and they could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_12_ITEM1_P206_S4	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P207_S0	Carriers also pay fees for switched wholesale transport services in and out of Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P207_S1	The rates for such services offered by and to any provider were governed by a federal law that was effective through December 31, 2009.
75679_12_ITEM1_P207_S2	The expiration of the applicable federal law has resulted in a decrease in the rates for services, resulting in a reduction of revenues, which may continue over time.
75679_12_ITEM1_P208_S0	The ability to obtain UNEs is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_12_ITEM1_P208_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be sustained in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rules that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_12_ITEM1_P208_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P208_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_12_ITEM1_P209_S0	Recurring and non-recurring charges for UNE loops and other UNEs may increase based on the rates adopted in RCA proceedings to establish new Interconnection Agreements or renew existing agreements.
75679_12_ITEM1_P209_S1	These increases could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1_P210_S0	The USF pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETC") to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P210_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P210_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_12_ITEM1_P211_S0	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P211_S1	Support for CETC serving areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau will follow national reforms, capping support per provider per service area as of January 1, 2012, and commencing a five-step phase-down on July 1, 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P211_S2	In addition to broader reforms, the FCC tailored revisions specifically for CETCs serving Remote Alaska, intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P211_S3	Support to these locations will be capped and distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_12_ITEM1_P211_S4	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_12_ITEM1_P211_S5	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_12_ITEM1_P212_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_12_ITEM1_P213_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the USAC and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_12_ITEM1_P213_S1	Amongst several other less significant changes the order reduces on an interim basis the support previously available under Tier I through Tier III support mechanisms, requires an annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012 to be completed by the end of 2012, adopts a one per household rule with household defined as an economic unit, and requires biennial audits for all ETCs receiving more than $5.0 million annually from Lifeline.
75679_12_ITEM1_P214_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_12_ITEM1_P214_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_12_ITEM1_P214_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_12_ITEM1_P215_S0	The 1996 Telecom Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_12_ITEM1_P216_S0	Because cable communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_12_ITEM1_P217_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P217_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_12_ITEM1_P217_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_12_ITEM1_P218_S0	The RCA is also certified under federal law to regulate rates for the Basic Service tier on our cable systems.
75679_12_ITEM1_P218_S1	Under state law, however, cable television service is exempt from regulation unless subscribers petition the RCA.
75679_12_ITEM1_P218_S2	At present, regulation of basic cable rates takes place only in Juneau.
75679_12_ITEM1_P219_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_12_ITEM1_P220_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_12_ITEM1_P221_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P221_S1	The FCC requirement that cable operators carry both the analog and digital programming streams of broadcast television stations while broadcasters are transitioning from analog to digital transmission does not apply to all-digital systems like ours.
75679_12_ITEM1_P221_S2	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P222_S0	Cable System Delivery of Internet Service.
75679_12_ITEM1_P222_S1	The FCC has defined high-speed Internet over cable as an information service not subject to local cable franchise fees, as cable service may be, or any explicit requirements for open access.
75679_12_ITEM1_P222_S2	The Supreme Court affirmed the FCC s position in a decision issued in 2005.
75679_12_ITEM1_P223_S0	Although there is at present no significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services, proposals previously have been advanced at the FCC and before Congress to require cable operators to provide access to unaffiliated Internet service providers and online service providers and to govern the terms under which content providers and applications are delivered by all broadband network operators.
75679_12_ITEM1_P223_S1	If such requirements were imposed on cable operators, it could burden the capacity of cable systems and frustrate our plans for providing expanded Internet access services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P223_S2	These access obligations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1_P224_S0	The FCC mandated, effective July 1, 2007, that all new set-top video navigation devices must segregate the security function from the navigation function.
75679_12_ITEM1_P224_S1	The new devices are more expensive than existing equipment, and compliance would increase our cost of providing cable services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P224_S2	Subject to a waiver granted by the FCC on May 4, 2007, we may continue providing low-cost integrated set-top boxes to consumers to facilitate our all-digital cable networks.
75679_12_ITEM1_P225_S0	On April 21, 2010, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry to consider ways to develop a standardized interface for accessing video content, as an alternative to set-top boxes.
75679_12_ITEM1_P225_S1	Adoption of new rules or standards in this area could affect the manner in which we deliver video products to our customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P225_S2	We do not know if the FCC will propose rules for further consideration.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S5	In addition, on April 7, 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S6	The order has no immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles; however, the order is currently subject to petitions for reconsideration.
75679_12_ITEM1_P226_S7	Though the general purpose of rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, due to the pending reconsideration requests, we cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding.
75679_12_ITEM1_P227_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_12_ITEM1_P227_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_12_ITEM1_P227_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_12_ITEM1_P227_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast program ming.
75679_12_ITEM1_P228_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_12_ITEM1_P229_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the Internet.
75679_12_ITEM1_P229_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_12_ITEM1_P229_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_12_ITEM1_P229_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_12_ITEM1_P230_S0	Although the FCC does not regulate the prices charged by Internet service providers or Internet backbone providers, the vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P230_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_12_ITEM1_P230_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_12_ITEM1_P231_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_12_ITEM1_P231_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P232_S0	On November 20, 2011, FCC issued rules governing the activities of cable operators and other Internet service providers in connection with the provision of Internet service.
75679_12_ITEM1_P232_S1	The rules generally prohibit blocking lawful content and prohibiting unreasonable discrimination, outside of reasonable network management, as well as imposing transparency and related disclosure requirements.
75679_12_ITEM1_P232_S2	We do not believe at this time that these requirements represent significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services.
75679_12_ITEM1_P232_S3	In addition, these rules are subject to court appeals.
75679_12_ITEM1_P233_S0	Further legislative proposals under the banner of net neutrality, if adopted, could interfere with our ability to reasonably manage and invest in our broadband network, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_12_ITEM1_P234_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_12_ITEM1_P234_S1	As a licensee of PCS, LMDS, and other wireless services, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services, including the PCS and LMDS services (described above).
75679_12_ITEM1_P235_S0	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P236_S0	Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting and construction of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas on towers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P237_S0	We have completed negotiation and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements between GCI and all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_12_ITEM1_P237_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_12_ITEM1_P238_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P238_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_12_ITEM1_P238_S2	Several wireless carriers, including us, have successfully applied to the RCA for ETC status in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P238_S3	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P238_S4	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_12_ITEM1_P239_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_12_ITEM1_P240_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s communications number and approximate location.
75679_12_ITEM1_P241_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters recently revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_12_ITEM1_P241_S1	We are assessing the application of such parameters in Alaska s relatively low population and rural service areas.
75679_12_ITEM1_P242_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_12_ITEM1_P243_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_12_ITEM1_P243_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_12_ITEM1_P243_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_12_ITEM1_P244_S0	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_12_ITEM1_P244_S1	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P244_S2	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_12_ITEM1_P245_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_12_ITEM1_P245_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to our customers and result in higher costs to our customers.
75679_12_ITEM1_P246_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_12_ITEM1_P246_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_12_ITEM1_P246_S2	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_12_ITEM1_P247_S0	Although we have several agreements to help originate and terminate international toll traffic, we do not have foreign operations or export sales.
75679_12_ITEM1_P247_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the western contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_12_ITEM1_P248_S0	We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_12_ITEM1_P249_S0	We offer voice, data and wireless telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P249_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P250_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries, and in particular oil production, as well as investment earnings, tourism, government, and United States military spending.
75679_12_ITEM1_P250_S1	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us.
75679_12_ITEM1_P251_S0	A significant part of the Alaska economy is the state government.
75679_12_ITEM1_P251_S1	All of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes, leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues for the State of Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P251_S2	The State of Alaska reported in fiscal 2011 that oil revenues supplied 92% of the State's unrestricted revenues.
75679_12_ITEM1_P251_S3	In fiscal 2012 state economists forecast that Alaska s oil revenues will supply 92% of the State s projected unrestricted revenues.
75679_12_ITEM1_P252_S0	The volume of oil transported by the TransAlaska Oil Pipeline System over its life to date has been as high as 2.011 million barrels per day in fiscal 1988.
75679_12_ITEM1_P252_S1	Production has been declining over the last several years with an average of 603,000 barrels produced per day in fiscal 2011.
75679_12_ITEM1_P252_S2	The State forecasts the production rate to decline from 574,000 barrels produced per day in fiscal 2012 to 458,000 barrels produced per day in fiscal 2021.
75679_12_ITEM1_P253_S0	Market prices for North Slope oil averaged $94.49 in fiscal 2011 and are forecasted to average $109.33 in fiscal 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P253_S1	The closing price per barrel was $127.34 on March 1, 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P254_S0	To the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the State s projected prices, the State s projected revenues and deficits will change.
75679_12_ITEM1_P254_S1	The production policy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the State s revenue forecast.
75679_12_ITEM1_P255_S0	Should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed, the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the Prudhoe Bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the State, in general, and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services, and, therefore, on us, in particular.
75679_12_ITEM1_P256_S0	Royal Dutch Shell plc is working with regulators to secure all the required permits to begin drilling for oil in the Chukchi Sea in the summer of 2012.
75679_12_ITEM1_P257_S0	Periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ).
75679_12_ITEM1_P257_S1	The United States Energy Information Agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of ANWR exploration.
75679_12_ITEM1_P258_S0	No assurance can be given that the driving forces in the Alaska economy, and in particular, oil production, will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity.
75679_12_ITEM1_P258_S1	The governor of the State of Alaska and the Alaska legislature continue to evaluate the state s oil tax structure which may also affect the oil production industry in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P259_S0	No assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in Alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market.
75679_12_ITEM1_P260_S0	We are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of North Slope oil on Alaska s economy or on us.
75679_12_ITEM1_P261_S0	Deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the State of Alaska s North Slope to the lower 48 states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies.
75679_12_ITEM1_P261_S1	Companies that have been studying the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline, which depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas, have not been able to secure adequate shipping bids to date.
75679_12_ITEM1_P261_S2	Production of natural gas supplies, whether through a pipeline or other means, continues to be studied by government regulators and the involved parties.
75679_12_ITEM1_P262_S0	The State of Alaska maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund ( CBRF ) that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls.
75679_12_ITEM1_P262_S1	If the State s current projections are realized and no surpluses are deposited into the CBRF it is projected that the fund would not be depleted before 2021.
75679_12_ITEM1_P263_S0	The date the CBRF is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil.
75679_12_ITEM1_P263_S1	If the fund is depleted, aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget.
75679_12_ITEM1_P263_S2	The governor of the State of Alaska and the Alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures.
75679_12_ITEM1_P264_S0	We have, since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace, aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market.
75679_12_ITEM1_P264_S1	The customer base in Alaska is limited, however, with a population of approximately 722,000 people.
75679_12_ITEM1_P264_S2	The State of Alaska s population is distributed as follows:
75679_12_ITEM1_P265_S0	The remaining 20% are located in other communities across the State of Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1_P266_S0	We employed 1,702 persons as of December 31, 2011, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_12_ITEM1_P266_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_12_ITEM1_P266_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_12_ITEM1_P267_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications industry.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face increasing video services competition from DBS providers.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Each of our business segments also faces the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Item 1 Business Narrative Description of our Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry by, and the rates charged by, commercial mobile radio service providers, except that states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The FCC has initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Changes proposed by the FCC could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operation costs.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The FCC adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects, which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The FCC is also considering changes to its rules regarding environmental protection as related to tower construction, which, if adopted, could make it more difficult to deploy facilities.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Currently, pursuant to Alaska law, the basic video rates in Juneau are the only rates in Alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority, and the rates in Juneau were reviewed and approved by the RCA in July 2010.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Proposals may be made before Congress and the FCC to mandate cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to Internet service providers.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As of the date of this report, the FCC has declined to impose such requirements.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If the FCC or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems, we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our Internet service offerings.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in the regulatory environment relating to the Internet access market, including changes in legislation, FCC regulation, judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ILEC or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In some Alaska markets, it also depends on our ability to gain interconnection at economic costs.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Competition contained in Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This support was 19%, 18%, and 14% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We had USF net receivables of $69.8 million and $64.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	For example, on November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	As described further in Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the reform changes reduce our future high cost support revenue.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit program for funding our TERRA-NW project.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In 2011 we entered into an arrangement under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund our TERRA-NW project.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In connection with the NMTC transaction we received proceeds which are restricted for use on TERRA-NW.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The NMTC is subject to 100% recapture for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangement.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We have indemnified US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $30.7 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Failure to complete development, testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions, including the current economic downturn in the United States, could negatively affect our business.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	While it is often difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The government has taken various measures in an attempt to help improve the economy, however, we are unable to predict the success or outcome of such programs.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	For these reasons, among others, if the current economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We offer voice, data and wireless communication and video services to customers primarily in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, our growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries, in particular oil production, as well as tourism, and government spending, including substantial amounts for the United States military.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on the demand for communication and video services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, the customer base in Alaska is limited.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Alaska has a population of approximately 722,000 people, 54% of whom are located in the Anchorage and Matanuska-Susitna Borough region.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and in other locations in Alaska.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The markets in Alaska for voice, data and wireless communications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Natural disasters, terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Unanticipated problems at our facilities or with our technical infrastructure, system or equipment failures, hardware or software failures or defects, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of our services and cause network service interruptions.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Unauthorized access to or use of customer or account information, including credit card or other personal data, could result in harm to our customers and legal actions against us, and could damage our reputation.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P45_S6	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Prolonged service interruptions could affect our business.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	We are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P47_S5	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability and suffer from adverse publicity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system can result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply video, Internet, DLPS, wireless and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the incurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground transmission lines.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our significant debt and capital lease obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, other debt or capital leases .
75679_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and capital lease obligations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	On December 31, 2011, we had total debt of $861.3 million and total capital lease obligations of $125.5 million.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our high level of debt and capital lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends on GCI s common stock.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P64_S4	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P64_S5	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous other wireless carriers seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P69_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Additionally, new government regulations on the use of a wireless device while driving may affect us through a reduction in usage revenue.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Studies have indicated that using wireless devices while driving may impair a driver s attention.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Many state and local legislative bodies, including Alaska s, have passed or proposed legislation to restrict the use of wireless telephones while driving vehicles.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Concerns over safety and the effect of future legislation, if adopted and enforced in the areas we serve, could limit our ability to market and sell our wireless services.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries allegedly incurred as a result of wireless telephone use while driving could result in adverse publicity and further governmental regulation.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	A significant percentage of GCI s voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	As of December 31, 2011, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 10% of GCI s combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 21% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI s Board.
75679_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	In this Annual Report, we, us, our, and the Company refer to GCI, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

75679_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Also refer to note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
75679_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues.
75679_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	We offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, data services, Internet access, video services and local and long-distance voice services, to residential and business customers across the state under our GCI brand.
75679_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	We benefit from the attractive demographic and economic characteristics of Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Since GCI s founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	In recent years, we expanded our efforts in wireless and presently operate the only statewide wireless network.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our network provides access for both global system for mobile communications ( GSM ) and code division multiple access ( CDMA ) based devices, and fourth generation evolved high-speed packet access ( HSPA+ ) based wireless communications.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	As of December 31, 2012, our cable systems passed 78% of Alaska s households, and we have achieved 50% basic cable penetration of the homes we reach.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S5	We believe we offer superior video services relative to direct broadcast satellite ( DBS ), which is limited by Alaska s geographic location, challenging climate and terrain features.
75679_13_ITEM1_P9_S6	At December 31, 2012, 80% of the local access lines we served were carried on our own last mile facilities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Consumer segment serves residential customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our Network Access segment serves other common carriers.

75679_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012, we generated consolidated revenues of $710.2 million.
75679_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	We ended the period with 140,000 wireless subscribers, 128,900 cable modem subscribers, 140,000 basic video subscribers and 129,600 local access lines in service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	On June 4, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement ( Wireless Agreement ) by and among Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. ( ACS ), GCI, ACS Wireless, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACS ( ACS Member ), GCI Wireless Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, and The Alaska Wireless Network, LLC ( AWN ), a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We entered into this agreement to provide a robust, statewide network with the spectrum mix, scale, advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with Verizon Wireless ( Verizon ) and AT T Mobility, LLC ( AT T Mobility ) in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	After the transaction closes AWN will provide wholesale services to GCI and ACS.
75679_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	GCI and ACS will use the AWN network in order to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P12_S4	GCI and ACS will continue to compete against each other and other wireless providers in the retail market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we agreed to purchase certain wireless network assets from ACS and its affiliates for $100.0 million and we will contribute the purchased assets, our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	ACS also agreed to contribute its remaining wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Upon the contribution of assets to AWN, ACS Member will own one-third of AWN and we will own two-thirds of AWN.
75679_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	ACS Member will be entitled to receive preferential cash distributions totaling $190.0 million over the first four years of AWN s operations and we will be entitled to all remaining cash distributions during that period.
75679_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	We anticipate that the $190.0 million preferential distributions to ACS will constitute approximately $80.0 million in distributions over the distributions otherwise attributable to their ownership percentage during such period.
75679_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Following the initial four year period, we and ACS Member will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests.
75679_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We are evaluating the accounting treatment for this transaction.
75679_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The closing of the transactions is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required governmental and third party consents and approvals and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods under competition laws.
75679_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired without any objections.
75679_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	In August 2011, we entered into our first financing arrangement under the New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC ) program that provided $16.5 million in net cash to our wholly owned subsidiary, Unicom, Inc. ( Unicom ), to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network.
75679_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	This project, called TERRA-NW, connects to our TERRA-SW network and provides a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the Internet.
75679_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	In October 2012 and December 2012, we entered into our second and third financing arrangements, respectively, under the NMTC program.
75679_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	The second and third NMTC transactions provided $12.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in net cash to Unicom.
75679_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	In September 2011, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ( RCA ) approved our application for a $5.3 million grant to help fund TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	The grant was increased to $6.3 million in January 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	The NMTC arrangements and grant award discussed above partially fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	We plan to fund an additional $20.7 million for TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	We began construction on TERRA-NW in 2012 and expect to complete all current phases of the project in 2014.
75679_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	We began offering service on Phase 1 of this new facility on January 3, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	On February 6, 2012, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the Universal Service Fund s ( USF ) Lifeline program.
75679_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ( USAC ) and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at affordable rates.
75679_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	The order adopted several reforms but the only reform with a significant 2012 impact was a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012, to be completed by the end of 2012 subject to the waiver to perfect early recertifications by January 31, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	The completion of the annual recertification process was the primary reason for our loss of approximately 10,000 Lifeline subscribers from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	I auction for a $3.2 million grant to partially fund expansion of our 3G wireless network to high cost rural locations in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Upon review we agreed to accept $2.3 million.
75679_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Upon FCC authorization of our final application submission, which is currently pending, we plan to begin construction in 2013 and expect to complete the project in 2014.
75679_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	On November 9, 2012, we entered into asset purchase agreements, pursuant to which Denali Media Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Denali Media Anchorage, Corp. and Denali Media Southeast, Corp., agreed to purchase three Alaska broadcast stations: CBS affiliate KTVA-TV of Anchorage and NBC affiliates KATH-TV in Juneau and KSCT-TV of Sitka, for a total of $7.6 million ( Media Agreements ).
75679_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	We entered into these agreements as the first step toward providing a new statewide platform for news and information as well as a method to provide unique content and value to our video subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	The Media Agreements are subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required governmental approvals from the FCC.

75679_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We intend to continue to increase revenues using the following strategies:
75679_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	We offer innovative service bundles to meet the needs of our consumer and commercial customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe that bundling our services significantly improves customer retention, increases revenue per customer and reduces customer acquisition expenses.
75679_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our experience indicates that our bundled customers are significantly less likely to churn, and we experience less price erosion when we effectively combine our offerings.
75679_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	Bundling improves our top line revenue growth, provides operating cost efficiencies that expand our margins and drives our overall business performance.
75679_13_ITEM1_P27_S4	As a measure of success to date, over 85,000 of our residential customers subscribe to one of our service bundles that include two or more services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	We successfully sell new and enhanced services and products between and within our business segments to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.
75679_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our 41 retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.

75679_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	A discussion of competition by product and service in our Consumer segment follows.
75679_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	We compete against AT T Mobility, ACS, MTA, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	In November 2010, Verizon acquired a license for 700 MHz wireless spectrum covering Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	We expect Verizon will complete their build of a LTE network in 2013 and subsequently they will be an additional competitor where our markets overlap.
75679_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.
75679_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry.
75679_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Number portability allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	The national wireless carriers against whom we compete or expect to compete, AT T Mobility and Verizon, have resources that are substantially greater than ours.
75679_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	These companies have significantly greater spectrum, capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.
75679_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P93_S3	In 2012, along with other regional wireless carriers in Alaska, we gained access to, and began offering, the iPhone-series of wireless handsets to our subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P93_S4	In addition, as discussed in Development of Our Business During the Past Fiscal Year section of this Item 1, we have entered into an agreement with ACS to create AWN, which will allow us to compete better against the national carriers on all resource fronts.
75679_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, bundled services, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, network coverage and capacity, the type of wireless handsets offered, and the availability of differentiated features and services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	Competition is based upon price and pricing plans, service bundles, the types of services offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	We compete with other Alaska based Internet providers and domestic, non-Alaska based providers that provide national service coverage.
75679_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	Several of the providers headquartered outside of Alaska have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	With respect to our high-speed cable modem service, ACS and other Alaska telephone service providers are providing competitive high-speed data subscriber line services over their telephone lines in direct competition with our high-speed cable modem service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	DBS providers and local fixed wireless providers supply wireless high-speed Internet service in competition with our high-speed cable modem services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	Niche providers in the industry, both local and national, compete with certain of our Internet service products, such as web hosting, list services and e-mail.
75679_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P98_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
75679_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our video systems face competition from online services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, as well as alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals, including DBS, digital video over telephone lines, broadband IP-based services, wireless and satellite master antenna television ("SMATV") systems, and from other sources of news, information and entertainment such as off-air television broadcast programming, newspapers, movie theaters, live sporting events, interactive computer services, and home video products, including video discs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems by other cable television operators and municipally-owned cable systems, and alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals.
75679_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	Online video services via the Internet are a major growing source of competition for our video services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow Internet average revenue per subscriber.
75679_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	We believe that the greatest source of external competition for our video services comes from the DBS industry.
75679_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	Two major companies, DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering nationwide high-power DBS services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P101_S2	The ILECs in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and Ketchikan offer digital video service over telephone lines in limited areas.
75679_13_ITEM1_P101_S3	Their product offerings and price points are similar to our product offerings.
75679_13_ITEM1_P101_S4	With the addition of Anchorage local broadcast stations, increased marketing, ILEC and DBS alliances, and emerging technologies creating new opportunities, competition from these sources has increased and will likely continue to increase.
75679_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	Competitive forces will be counteracted by offering expanded programming through digital services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	Digital delivery technology is being utilized in all of our systems.
75679_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	We have retransmission agreements with Anchorage broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into all our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P103_S2	Additionally, in November 2012 we entered into the Media Agreements as a method to provide unique content and value to video subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	Other new technologies may become competitive with non-entertainment services that video systems can offer.
75679_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	The FCC has authorized television broadcast stations to transmit textual and graphic information useful to both consumers and businesses.
75679_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	The FCC also permits commercial and non-commercial FM radio stations to use their subcarrier frequencies to provide non-broadcast services including data transmissions.
75679_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	The FCC established an over-the-air interactive video and data service that will permit two-way interaction with commercial and educational programming along with informational and data services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	ILECs and other common carriers also provide facilities for the transmission and distribution to homes and businesses of interactive computer-based services, including the Internet, as well as data and other non-video services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	The FCC has conducted spectrum auctions for licenses to provide personal communication services ( PCS ) as well as other services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	PCS and other services will enable license holders, including cable operators, to provide voice and data services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P107_S2	We own a statewide PCS license in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_13_ITEM1_P108_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_13_ITEM1_P108_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.
75679_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry (such as the public utilities that own certain of the poles on which cable is attached) may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of communication services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_13_ITEM1_P110_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P110_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
75679_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	We compete against ACS, the ILEC in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks and the Kenai Peninsula area; MTA, the ILEC in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other smaller ILECs in other communities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	In the local telephone services market, the 1996 Telecom Act, judicial decisions, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments, and new technologies have increased the overall likelihood that barriers to local telephone competition will be substantially reduced or removed.
75679_13_ITEM1_P112_S1	These initiatives include requirements that ILECs negotiate with entities, including us, to provide interconnection to the existing local telephone network, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way and to resell services offered by the ILEC.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	We have been able to obtain interconnection, access and related services from the ILECs, at rates that allow us to offer competitive services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S1	However, if we are unable to continue to obtain these services and access at acceptable rates, our ability to offer local access services, and our revenues and net income, could be materially adversely affected.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S2	To date, we have been successful in capturing a significant portion of the local telephone market in the locations where we are offering these services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S3	However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining these customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S4	In addition, wireless and VoIP services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S5	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P113_S6	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	The long-distance industry is intensely competitive, with service offerings based upon price and bundling.
75679_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	In the intrastate, interstate and international long-distance market, we compete against ACS, MTA, long-distance resellers, and certain smaller rural local telephone companies.
75679_13_ITEM1_P115_S1	There is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the Alaska market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	In addition, wireless and voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P116_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P116_S2	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for long-distance calling.
75679_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	We have competed in the long-distance market by offering discounts from rates charged by our competitors and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies.
75679_13_ITEM1_P119_S0	We believe that we have certain advantages over ILECs in providing communications services, including awareness by Alaskan customers of the GCI brand name, our facilities-based communications network, and our prior experience in, and knowledge of, the Alaskan market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P120_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_13_ITEM1_P121_S0	Our Consumer segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_13_ITEM1_P121_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.

75679_13_ITEM1_P130_S0	We are engaged in the transmission of interstate and intrastate-switched message telephone service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P130_S1	We terminate northbound message telephone service traffic for several large resellers who do not have facilities of their own in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P130_S2	We also provide origination of southbound calling card, toll-free services, and toll services for interexchange carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P130_S3	Services are generally provided pursuant to contracts.
75679_13_ITEM1_P131_S0	Our Network Access segment sales and marketing efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of other common carriers we serve, the number of billable minutes of wireless and long-distance traffic, and the number of billable megabytes of wireless data traffic we carry over our network and the number of voice and data transmission circuits leased.
75679_13_ITEM1_P131_S1	We sell our voice, data and wireless services primarily through direct contact marketing.
75679_13_ITEM1_P132_S0	Our Network Access segment shares common facilities used for wireless, data and voice services by other segments.
75679_13_ITEM1_P132_S1	You should refer to Consumer Segment Facilities above for additional information.
75679_13_ITEM1_P133_S0	We had no major customer in 2012, 2011 or 2010.
75679_13_ITEM1_P134_S0	Our Network Access segment competes against AT T Alascom, ACS, and certain smaller rural local telephone carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P134_S1	There is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the Alaska market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P135_S0	Other common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in Alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to our carrier customers by their customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P135_S1	Pricing pressures, new program offerings, revised business plans, and market consolidation continue to evolve in the markets served by our carrier customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P135_S2	If, as a result, their traffic is reduced, or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in Alaska are reduced, our traffic will also likely be reduced, and we may have to respond to competitive pressures.
75679_13_ITEM1_P135_S3	We are unable to predict the effect of such changes on our business.
75679_13_ITEM1_P136_S0	Historically, we have competed in the Network Access segment market by offering rates comparable to or less than our competitors, by providing a comprehensive service model to meet the complete needs of our carrier customers, and by providing responsive customer service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P137_S0	Another carrier operates a pair of fiber optic cable facilities connecting points in Alaska to the lower 48 states.
75679_13_ITEM1_P137_S1	This additional fiber system provides direct competition to services we provide on our owned fiber optic cable facilities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P138_S0	Network Access segment long-distance and wireless services revenues derived from our other common carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction, commercial fishing, and oil and gas activities.

75679_13_ITEM1_P180_S0	Our Managed Broadband segment sales and marketing efforts focus on increasing the number of subscribers we serve, selling bundled services, and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P180_S1	We sell our Managed Broadband segment services and products primarily through direct contact marketing followed by competitive bidding.
75679_13_ITEM1_P181_S0	Our Managed Broadband segment services and products are delivered using a platform including many of the latest advancements in technology through a locally available circuit, our existing lines, and/or satellite earth stations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P181_S1	Our Internet services are partially provisioned over a satellite based digital video broadcast carrier that reduces the requirement for new satellite transponder bandwidth to support growth in ConnectMD , SchoolAccess and other broadband services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P182_S0	We employ a packet data satellite transmission technology for the efficient transport of broadband data in support of our ConnectMD and SchoolAccess initiatives.
75679_13_ITEM1_P182_S1	Our SchoolAccess Internet service is delivered as follows:
75679_13_ITEM1_P183_S0	In communities where we have terrestrial interconnects or provide existing service over regional earth stations, we have configured intermediate distribution facilities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P184_S0	In communities or remote locations to which we have not extended communications services, SchoolAccess is provided via a dedicated (usually on premise) very small aperture terminal ("VSAT") satellite station.
75679_13_ITEM1_P184_S1	The VSAT connects to an intermediate distribution facility located in Anchorage.
75679_13_ITEM1_P185_S0	Our facilities include TERRA-SW, a middle mile long haul broadband network.
75679_13_ITEM1_P185_S1	TERRA-SW provides terrestrial telecommunication service to 65 remote rural Alaska communities located in southwest Alaska through a hybrid microwave and fiber optic network.

75679_13_ITEM1_P185_S3	We utilize TERRA-SW to support growth in wireless and broadband services including ConnectMD and SchoolAccess .
75679_13_ITEM1_P186_S0	You should refer to Consumer Segment Facilities above for additional information.
75679_13_ITEM1_P187_S0	There are several competing companies in Alaska that actively sell broadband services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P187_S1	Our ability to provide end-to-end broadband services solutions has allowed us to maintain our market position based on value added services and products rather than solely based on price competition.
75679_13_ITEM1_P187_S2	These services are blended with other transport and software products into unique customer solutions, including SchoolAccess and ConnectMD applications such as video conferencing and unique web content services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P188_S0	Our Managed Broadband segment does not exhibit seasonality.
75679_13_ITEM1_P189_S0	Regulated Operations segment revenues for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_13_ITEM1_P190_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Regulated Operations segment.
75679_13_ITEM1_P191_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment offers wireline communications services , including local access and long-distance, to our residential and commercial customers in 61 rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska, under our United Utilities, Inc. ( UUI ) and United-KUC, Inc. ( United-KUC ) brands.
75679_13_ITEM1_P192_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve.
75679_13_ITEM1_P192_S1	We sell our Regulated Operations segment services through local media advertising, retail stores, and through our website.
75679_13_ITEM1_P193_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment services are delivered by switching, outside plant, terrestrial microwave, and satellite facilities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P193_S1	Our outside plant is primarily aerial and buried copper and fiber optic cables.
75679_13_ITEM1_P194_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment s competition results from a growing number of consumers using wireless service as the primary source for their voice phone service .
75679_13_ITEM1_P194_S1	However, the only wireless provider in their service area is ourselves, and thus the competition source is internal as our Consumer and Commercial segment subscriber revenue replaces Regulated Operations segment subscriber revenue.
75679_13_ITEM1_P195_S0	Our Regulated Operations segment services do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_13_ITEM1_P196_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, Internet and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_13_ITEM1_P196_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_13_ITEM1_P197_S0	We may undertake activities that, under certain circumstances, may affect the environment.
75679_13_ITEM1_P197_S1	Accordingly, they are subject to federal, state, and local regulations designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.
75679_13_ITEM1_P198_S0	The FCC, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
75679_13_ITEM1_P199_S0	We believe that compliance with such regulations has had no material effect on our consolidated operations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P199_S1	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Seattle, Washington, and Warrenton, Oregon.
75679_13_ITEM1_P199_S2	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_13_ITEM1_P199_S3	Some facilities may be on wetlands that may be subject to state and/or federal regulation.
75679_13_ITEM1_P200_S0	Most of our facilities are on leased property, and, with respect to all of these facilities, we are unaware of any violations of lease terms or federal, state or local regulations pertaining to preservation or protection of the environment.
75679_13_ITEM1_P201_S0	The engineered routes of our projects to construct terrestrial and undersea fiber optic cable facilities pass over wetlands and other environmentally sensitive areas.
75679_13_ITEM1_P201_S1	We believe our construction methods used for buried cable have a minimal impact on the environment.
75679_13_ITEM1_P201_S2	The agencies, among others, that are involved in permitting and oversight of our cable deployment efforts are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.
75679_13_ITEM1_P201_S3	We are unaware of any violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits pertaining to preservation or protection of the environment.
75679_13_ITEM1_P202_S0	In the course of operating our video and communications systems, we have used various materials defined as hazardous by applicable governmental regulations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P202_S1	These materials have been used for insect repellent, paint used to mark the location of our facilities, and pole treatment, and as heating fuel, transformer oil, cable cleaner, batteries, diesel fuel, and in various other ways in the operation of those systems.
75679_13_ITEM1_P202_S2	We do not believe that these materials, when used in accordance with manufacturer instructions, pose an unreasonable hazard to those who use them or to the environment.
75679_13_ITEM1_P202_S3	Where present at levels above applicable thresholds, we submit annual reports detailing hazardous substance quantities and locations to emergency responders under the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act.
75679_13_ITEM1_P203_S0	Our construction activities and operations include transporting fuel via helicopter to remote locations within Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P203_S1	To any extent not covered by our insurance or that of our contractors, we could incur cleanup costs and third-party claims for property damage if fuel were to be released to underlying lands or water while in flight.
75679_13_ITEM1_P203_S2	New laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could result in additional costs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P204_S0	We do not hold patents, franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P204_S1	We do hold federally registered service marks, used by each of our reportable segments, for the marks GCI , SchoolAccess , Alaska United Fiber Optic Cable System , GCI ConnectMD , ConnectMD , GCI Hypernet , My GCI , MyGCI , Keep Talking Alaska , Unicom , and United-KUC .
75679_13_ITEM1_P204_S2	The original deadline to renew the registration for the mark Unicom for a new 10-year term has expired; however, the registration is in a grace period and our intention is to renew the registration before the end of the grace period.
75679_13_ITEM1_P204_S3	We also own two pending applications to register the mark GCI TurboZone.
75679_13_ITEM1_P204_S4	Both applications have been approved for publication.
75679_13_ITEM1_P205_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_13_ITEM1_P206_S0	We hold licenses through our subsidiary GCI Communication Corp. ( GCICC ) for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Consumer, Commercial and Network Access segments.
75679_13_ITEM1_P207_S0	We hold the following licenses, among others:
75679_13_ITEM1_P208_S0	Two licenses for use of a 30 MHz block of spectrum, which together authorize provision of PCS services in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P208_S1	Both licenses have an expiration date of June 23, 2015.
75679_13_ITEM1_P208_S2	Licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_13_ITEM1_P209_S0	A local multipoint distribution system ("LMDS") license which we acquired in 1998 for use of a 150 MHz block of spectrum in the 28 GHz Ka-band for providing wireless services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P209_S1	The LMDS license was renewed in 2008 for an additional 10-year term, following the grant of an extension until June 1, 2012, of the requirement to provide substantial service in the service region.
75679_13_ITEM1_P209_S2	We timely satisfied this condition, as reflected in the required FCC filing on June 1, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P210_S0	Several 25 MHz cellular B licenses are held by our subsidiary Unicom for sites located in the Wade Hampton AK-1 portion of CMA 315 and the Bethel AK-2 portion of CMA 316, and operated by GCICC pursuant to a de facto long-term spectrum lease.
75679_13_ITEM1_P211_S0	Earth stations are licensed generally for fifteen years.
75679_13_ITEM1_P211_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations (e.g., VSATs).
75679_13_ITEM1_P211_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_13_ITEM1_P212_S0	We are certified through the RCA to provide video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_13_ITEM1_P212_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates issued for each community.
75679_13_ITEM1_P212_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_13_ITEM1_P213_S0	Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_13_ITEM1_P213_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_13_ITEM1_P213_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_13_ITEM1_P213_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P214_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_13_ITEM1_P214_S1	As a licensee of PCS, LMDS, and other wireless services, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services, including the PCS and LMDS services (as discussed above in the Patents, Trademarks and Licenses section of this Item 1).
75679_13_ITEM1_P215_S0	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
75679_13_ITEM1_P216_S0	Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, and registration of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas on towers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P217_S0	The USF pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_13_ITEM1_P217_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_13_ITEM1_P217_S2	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P217_S3	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_13_ITEM1_P218_S0	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P218_S1	Support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers ( CETCs ) serving areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau followed national reforms and had support per provider per service area capped as of January 1, 2012, and a five-step phase-down commenced on July 1, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P218_S2	In addition to broader reforms, the FCC tailored revisions specifically for CETCs serving Remote Alaska, intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas.
75679_13_ITEM1_P218_S3	Support to these locations is capped and distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_13_ITEM1_P218_S4	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_13_ITEM1_P218_S5	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_13_ITEM1_P219_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_13_ITEM1_P220_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the USAC and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_13_ITEM1_P220_S1	The order adopted several reforms, but the only reform with a significant 2012 impact was a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012 to be completed by the end of 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P220_S2	In an order released on December 27, 2012, the FCC s Wireline Competition Bureau granted GCI a waiver to permit early recertification of subscribers (those recertified prior to June 1, 2012), subject to the condition that certain address information be verified for a subset of those subscribers by January 31, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P221_S0	We have completed negotiation and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements between GCI and all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P221_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_13_ITEM1_P222_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service and Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks for more information.
75679_13_ITEM1_P223_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s phone number and approximate location.
75679_13_ITEM1_P224_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters recently revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_13_ITEM1_P225_S0	Due to Alaska s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.
75679_13_ITEM1_P225_S1	We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC s standard.
75679_13_ITEM1_P226_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_13_ITEM1_P227_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_13_ITEM1_P227_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_13_ITEM1_P227_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P228_S0	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_13_ITEM1_P228_S1	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P228_S2	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_13_ITEM1_P229_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_13_ITEM1_P229_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to our customers and result in higher costs to our customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P230_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_13_ITEM1_P230_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_13_ITEM1_P230_S2	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_13_ITEM1_P231_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the Internet.
75679_13_ITEM1_P231_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_13_ITEM1_P231_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_13_ITEM1_P231_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_13_ITEM1_P232_S0	Although the FCC does not regulate the prices charged by Internet service providers or Internet backbone providers, the vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P232_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_13_ITEM1_P232_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P233_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_13_ITEM1_P233_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P234_S0	On November 20, 2011, the FCC issued rules governing the activities of cable operators and other Internet service providers in connection with the provision of Internet service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P234_S1	The rules generally prohibit blocking lawful content and prohibiting unreasonable discrimination, outside of reasonable network management, as well as imposing transparency and related disclosure requirements.
75679_13_ITEM1_P234_S2	We do not believe at this time that these requirements represent significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P234_S3	In addition, these rules are subject to court appeals.
75679_13_ITEM1_P235_S0	Further legislative proposals under the banner of net neutrality, if adopted, could interfere with our ability to reasonably manage and invest in our broadband network, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P236_S0	Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_13_ITEM1_P237_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P237_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P237_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_13_ITEM1_P238_S0	The RCA is also certified under federal law to regulate rates for the Basic Service tier on our video systems.
75679_13_ITEM1_P238_S1	Under state law, however, video service is exempt from regulation unless subscribers petition the RCA.
75679_13_ITEM1_P238_S2	At present, regulation of basic video rates takes place only in Juneau.
75679_13_ITEM1_P239_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P240_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_13_ITEM1_P241_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P241_S1	The FCC requirement that cable operators carry both the analog and digital programming streams of broadcast television stations while broadcasters are transitioning from analog to digital transmission does not apply to all-digital systems like ours.
75679_13_ITEM1_P241_S2	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P242_S0	Cable System Delivery of Internet Service.
75679_13_ITEM1_P242_S1	The FCC has defined high-speed Internet over cable as an information service not subject to local cable franchise fees, as video service may be, or any explicit requirements for open access.
75679_13_ITEM1_P242_S2	The Supreme Court affirmed the FCC s position in a decision issued in 2005.
75679_13_ITEM1_P243_S0	Although there is at present no significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services, proposals previously have been advanced at the FCC and before Congress to require cable operators to provide access to unaffiliated Internet service providers and online service providers and to govern the terms under which content providers and applications are delivered by all broadband network operators.
75679_13_ITEM1_P243_S1	If such requirements were imposed on cable operators, it could burden the capacity of cable systems and frustrate our plans for providing expanded Internet access services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P243_S2	These access obligations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1_P244_S0	The FCC mandated, effective July 1, 2007, that all new set-top video navigation devices must segregate the security function from the navigation function.
75679_13_ITEM1_P244_S1	The new devices are more expensive than existing equipment, and compliance would increase our cost of providing video services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P244_S2	Subject to a waiver granted by the FCC on May 4, 2007, we may continue providing low-cost integrated set-top boxes to consumers to facilitate our all-digital cable networks.
75679_13_ITEM1_P245_S0	On April 21, 2010, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry to consider ways to develop a standardized interface for accessing video content, as an alternative to set-top boxes.
75679_13_ITEM1_P245_S1	Adoption of new rules or standards in this area could affect the manner in which we deliver video products to our customers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P245_S2	We do not know if the FCC will propose rules for further consideration.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S5	In addition, on April 7, 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P246_S6	The United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, recently upheld the FCC s rules, denying challenges from several utility companies.
75679_13_ITEM1_P247_S0	Though the general purpose of rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.
75679_13_ITEM1_P248_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_13_ITEM1_P248_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_13_ITEM1_P248_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_13_ITEM1_P248_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast program ming.
75679_13_ITEM1_P249_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P250_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P250_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the RCA and the FCC as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P250_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_13_ITEM1_P251_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_13_ITEM1_P251_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P251_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_13_ITEM1_P252_S0	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1_P252_S1	Support for CETCs serving areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau followed national reforms and had support per provider per service area capped as of January 1, 2012, and a five-step phase-down commenced on July 1, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P252_S2	In addition to broader reforms, the FCC tailored revisions specifically for CETCs serving Remote Alaska, intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas.
75679_13_ITEM1_P252_S3	Support to these locations is capped and distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_13_ITEM1_P252_S4	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_13_ITEM1_P252_S5	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_13_ITEM1_P253_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_13_ITEM1_P254_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the USAC and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_13_ITEM1_P254_S1	The order adopted several reforms, but the only reform with a significant 2012 impact was a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012 to be completed by the end of 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P254_S2	In an order released on December 27, 2012, the FCC s Wireline Competition Bureau granted GCI a waiver to permit early recertification of subscribers (those recertified prior to June 1, 2012), subject to the condition that certain address information be verified for a subset of those subscribers by January 31, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P255_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_13_ITEM1_P256_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_13_ITEM1_P256_S1	We have had to participate in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs, including ACS for its Fairbanks and Juneau operating companies, MTA and Ketchikan Public Utilities, in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P256_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_13_ITEM1_P257_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P257_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P258_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Consumer Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_13_ITEM1_P259_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_13_ITEM1_P260_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_13_ITEM1_P260_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_13_ITEM1_P260_S2	We do not anticipate that the adopted changes, for which implementation began in 2012, will have a material impact, except that the reduction of interstate access rates generally will result in a cost savings on access charges to us.
75679_13_ITEM1_P260_S3	However, the details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and they could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_13_ITEM1_P260_S4	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P261_S0	Carriers also pay fees for switched wholesale transport services in and out of Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P261_S1	The rates for such services offered by and to any provider were governed by a federal law that was effective through December 31, 2009.
75679_13_ITEM1_P261_S2	The expiration of the applicable federal law has resulted in a decrease in the rates for services, resulting in a reduction of revenues, which may continue over time.
75679_13_ITEM1_P262_S0	The ability to obtain UNEs is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_13_ITEM1_P262_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be sustained in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rules that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_13_ITEM1_P262_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P262_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_13_ITEM1_P263_S0	Recurring and non-recurring charges for UNE loops and other UNEs may increase based on the rates adopted in RCA proceedings to establish new Interconnection Agreements or renew existing agreements.
75679_13_ITEM1_P263_S1	These increases could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1_P264_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_13_ITEM1_P264_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_13_ITEM1_P264_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_13_ITEM1_P265_S0	The 1996 Telecom Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_13_ITEM1_P266_S0	Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks.
75679_13_ITEM1_P266_S1	In recent months, AT T and the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association have petitioned the FCC to consider revisions to the regulatory regime governing interconnection and other policies related to the transition of networks from TDM-based to IP-based technologies.
75679_13_ITEM1_P266_S2	These proceedings are in early stages, and we cannot predict any resulting proceedings or their effect on us; however, a change in regulatory obligation or classification that interfered with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raised the cost of doing so, or that adversely affected eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
75679_13_ITEM1_P267_S0	On December 12, 2012, the FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund to supplement the existing Rural Health Care Program of the USF.
75679_13_ITEM1_P267_S1	Healthcare providers can choose to participate under either the existing Rural Health Care Program or the new Healthcare Connect Fund.
75679_13_ITEM1_P267_S2	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this change but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_13_ITEM1_P268_S0	Recently, the SEC adopted new rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act setting forth new disclosure requirements concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
75679_13_ITEM1_P268_S1	These new disclosure requirements begin in May 2014.
75679_13_ITEM1_P268_S2	We are still completing our review of the requirements as they pertain to us but do not believe complying with these disclosure requirements will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1_P269_S0	Although we have several agreements to originate and terminate international toll traffic, we do not have foreign operations or export sales.
75679_13_ITEM1_P269_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the western contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_13_ITEM1_P270_S0	We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_13_ITEM1_P271_S0	The national economy continues to see persistent unemployment and slow economic growth and even once stabilized is not expected to return quickly to a period of strong growth.
75679_13_ITEM1_P271_S1	Should the national economy deteriorate further, it could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth.
75679_13_ITEM1_P271_S2	However, we offer wireless, data and voice telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P271_S3	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska, and we believe the Alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time.
75679_13_ITEM1_P272_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries, and in particular oil production, as well as government spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_13_ITEM1_P272_S1	The government spending is comprised of state government and United States military spending.
75679_13_ITEM1_P272_S2	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us.
75679_13_ITEM1_P273_S0	A significant part of the Alaska economy is the state government.
75679_13_ITEM1_P273_S1	All of the State s federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes, leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues for the State of Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P273_S2	The State of Alaska reported in fiscal 2012 that oil revenues supplied 93% of the State's unrestricted revenues.
75679_13_ITEM1_P273_S3	In fiscal 2013 state economists forecast that Alaska s oil revenues will supply 92% of the State s projected unrestricted revenues.
75679_13_ITEM1_P274_S0	The volume of oil transported by the TransAlaska Oil Pipeline System over its life to date has been as high as 2.011 million barrels per day in fiscal 1988.
75679_13_ITEM1_P274_S1	Production has been declining over the last several years with an average of 579,000 barrels produced per day in fiscal 2012.
75679_13_ITEM1_P274_S2	The State forecasts the production rate to decline from 553,000 barrels produced per day in fiscal 2013 to 339,000 barrels produced per day in fiscal 2022.
75679_13_ITEM1_P275_S0	Market prices for North Slope oil averaged $112.65 in fiscal 2012 and are forecasted to average $108.67 in fiscal 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P275_S1	The closing price per barrel was $106.93 on March 1, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P276_S0	To the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the State s projected prices, the State s projected revenues and deficits will change.
75679_13_ITEM1_P277_S0	Should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed, the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the Prudhoe Bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the State, in general, and on demand for telecommunications and video services, and, therefore, on us, in particular.
75679_13_ITEM1_P278_S0	During 2012 Royal Dutch Shell plc secured all the required permits to begin drilling for oil in the Chukchi Sea but announced in early 2013 that they would delay exploration until 2014.
75679_13_ITEM1_P279_S0	Periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ).
75679_13_ITEM1_P279_S1	The United States Energy Information Agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of ANWR exploration.
75679_13_ITEM1_P280_S0	No assurance can be given that the driving forces in the Alaska economy, and in particular, oil production, will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity.
75679_13_ITEM1_P280_S1	The Governor of the State of Alaska and the Alaska Legislature continue to evaluate the State s oil tax structure which may also affect the oil production industry in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P281_S0	No assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in Alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P282_S0	We are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of North Slope oil on Alaska s economy or on us.
75679_13_ITEM1_P283_S0	Deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the State of Alaska s North Slope to the lower 48 states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies.
75679_13_ITEM1_P283_S1	Companies that have been studying the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline, which depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas, have not been able to secure adequate shipping bids to date.
75679_13_ITEM1_P283_S2	Production of natural gas supplies, whether through a pipeline or other means, continues to be studied by government regulators and the involved parties.
75679_13_ITEM1_P284_S0	The State of Alaska maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund ( CBRF ) that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls.
75679_13_ITEM1_P284_S1	If the State s current projections are realized and no surpluses are deposited into the CBRF it is projected that the fund would not be depleted before 2021.
75679_13_ITEM1_P285_S0	The date the CBRF is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil.
75679_13_ITEM1_P285_S1	If the fund is depleted, aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget.
75679_13_ITEM1_P285_S2	The Governor of the State of Alaska and the Alaska Legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures.
75679_13_ITEM1_P286_S0	We have, since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace, aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market.
75679_13_ITEM1_P286_S1	The customer base in Alaska is limited, however, with a population of approximately 732,000 people.
75679_13_ITEM1_P286_S2	The State of Alaska s population is distributed as follows:
75679_13_ITEM1_P287_S0	The remaining 20% are located in other communities across the State of Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1_P288_S0	In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act which committed the United States government to significantly reducing the federal deficit over ten years, including substantial automatic spending cuts, known as "sequestration," split between defense and non-defense programs.
75679_13_ITEM1_P288_S1	These spending cuts went into effect beginning March 1, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1_P289_S0	We are not able to predict the effect that sequestration or any form of spending cuts will have on Alaska s economy or on us.
75679_13_ITEM1_P290_S0	We employed 1,734 persons as of December 31, 2012, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_13_ITEM1_P290_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_13_ITEM1_P290_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_13_ITEM1_P291_S0	No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We face increasing wireless services competition from the expected entrance of Verizon into the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Most of our business segments also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Item 1 Business Narrative Description of our Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers perceptions of our services, and customer care quality.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Managing these factors and subscribers expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	AT T Wireless and Verizon, who is expected to be a competitor starting in 2013, have national networks which enable them to offer automatic roaming services to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We believe that the rates charged to us by some of these carriers are higher than the rates they charge to certain other roaming partners.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We do not currently have LTE data agreements with any carriers that are currently providing these services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The FCC has adopted rules requiring commercial mobile radio service providers to provide automatic roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The FCC has also adopted rules generally requiring carriers to offer data roaming services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently upheld the FCC s data roaming order from a challenge by Verizon Wireless.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	These orders, however, do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If we were unexpectedly to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may be unable to complete our pending transactions or if completed we may not be able to successfully manage the new operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The formation, with ACS, of AWN is crucial to our strategy to remain competitive in wireless services against the national wireless carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We anticipate being granted approval by the FCC and having the ability to close on the transactions contemplated in the Wireless Agreement by the end of the second quarter of 2013.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	A delay or failure to gain FCC approval or the occurrence of any other event delaying or causing a failure to complete the AWN transaction may cause us to incur additional and unforeseen expenses and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we complete the AWN transaction we may not be able to successfully integrate the network facilities or recognize the expected synergies which may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in our business and financial performance.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with this transaction may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may also incur additional and unforeseen expenses in connection with the integration efforts.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	There can be no assurance that the expense savings and synergies that we anticipate from the transaction will be realized fully or will be realized within the expected timeframe.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we complete the Denali Media transaction we may not be able to successfully manage the broadcast stations or recognize the expected synergies with our video services business which may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in our business and financial performance.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with this transaction may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may also incur additional and unforeseen expenses in connection with the management efforts.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	There can be no assurance that the expense savings and synergies that we anticipate from the transaction will be realized fully or will be realized within the expected timeframe.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry by, and the rates charged by, commercial mobile radio service providers, except that states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The FCC has initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes proposed by the FCC could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operation costs.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The FCC adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects, which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The FCC has adopted rule changes that require local notice in any community in which it is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental or other reasons.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This rule change could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Proposals may be made before Congress and the FCC to mandate cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to Internet service providers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As of the date of this report, the FCC has declined to impose such requirements.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If the FCC or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems, we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our Internet service offerings.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in the regulatory environment relating to the Internet access market, including changes in legislation, FCC regulation, judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ILEC or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Currently, pursuant to Alaska law, the basic video rates in Juneau are the only rates in Alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority; the rates in Juneau were reviewed and approved by the RCA in July 2010.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In some Alaska markets, it also depends on our ability to gain interconnection at economic costs.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Competition contained in Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This support was 19%, 19%, and 18% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We had USF net receivables of $70.1 million and $69.8 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	For example, on November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As described further in Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the reform changes reduced our current and future high cost support revenue.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireless Services and Products Universal Service and Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, as we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	We are not making payments on a per subscriber basis to local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video services customers but there can be no assurance that we will continue to avoid such payment.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We expect to continue to be subject to demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P40_S4	If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The decline in our Consumer, Network Access and Commercial voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We expect our Consumer, Network Access and Commercial voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our local access services and long-distance subscribers will continue to decline and possibly accelerate.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Additionally, we do not expect to increase the rates charged to our remaining subscribers resulting in decreasing results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We expect to continue to strategically use certain marketing and bundling strategies to slow the decline but we do not expect these strategies will significantly impact or stop the decline.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit program for funding our TERRA-NW project.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we have entered into three separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA-NW project.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which are restricted for use on TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $56.0 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Failure to complete development, testing and deployment of a new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions, including the current continued economic slowdown in the United States, could negatively affect our business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	While it is often difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The government has taken various measures in an attempt to help improve the economy, however, we are unable to predict the success or outcome of such programs.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	For these reasons, among others, if the current economic conditions persist or decline, this could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We offer voice, data and wireless communication and video services to customers primarily in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, our growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries, in particular oil production, as well as tourism, and government spending, including substantial amounts for the United States military.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Any deterioration in these markets or the occurrence of a single disruptive event, such as a shut-down of the TransAlaska Pipeline System, could have an adverse impact on the demand for communication and video services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, the customer base in Alaska is limited.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Alaska has a population of approximately 732,000 people, 54% of whom are located in the Anchorage and Matanuska-Susitna Borough region.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and in other locations in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The markets in Alaska for voice, data and wireless communications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	See the section Item 1 Business Geographic Concentration and the Alaska Economy for more information.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Natural disasters, terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Unanticipated problems at our facilities or with our technical infrastructure, system or equipment failures, hardware or software failures or defects, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of our services and cause network service interruptions.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Unauthorized access to or use of customer or account information, including credit card or other personal data, could result in harm to our customers and legal actions against us, and could damage our reputation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P61_S6	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Prolonged service interruptions could affect our business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P63_S5	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA-SW facility and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Our facilities also include TERRA-SW and its extensions which are an unringed facility operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or of our unringed TERRA-SW facility and its extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA-SW and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the incurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems .
75679_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our significant debt and capital lease obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, other debt or capital leases .
75679_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and capital lease obligations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	On December 31, 2012, we had total debt of $877.1 million and total capital lease obligations of $80.6 million.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We expect to fund our $100.0 million purchase of certain wireless assets from ACS and the $50.0 million working capital line of credit to AWN according to the Wireless Agreement by increasing our total debt.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Our high level of debt and capital lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends on GCI s common stock.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P79_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P80_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P80_S4	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P80_S5	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may be unable to obtain additional financing as needed to close our AWN transaction.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We expect to fund our $100.0 million purchase of certain wireless assets from ACS and the $50.0 million working capital line of credit to AWN according to the Wireless Agreement by increasing our total debt.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	It is difficult to predict future debt market conditions and whether we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Depending upon market conditions, any additional financing we might seek could be with rates and terms significantly less favorable than those contained in our outstanding debt instruments.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Other factors, such as a rating downgrade, could further impact our potential access to financing sources.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P82_S4	The failure to raise sufficient funds on reasonable terms could cause us to not close our AWN Transaction which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Any significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We had $294.9 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2012, consisting of cable certificates of $191.6 million, goodwill of $77.3 million and wireless licenses of $26.0 million.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our cable certificates are our largest indefinite-lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P89_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, and the fair value of the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P89_S3	The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P89_S4	These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P89_S5	Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code .
75679_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	At December 31, 2012, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $293.3 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	If GCI experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when its market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P91_S2	This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P93_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P93_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P93_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P93_S5	However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Additionally, new government regulations on the use of a wireless device while driving may affect us through a reduction in usage revenue.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Studies have indicated that using wireless devices while driving may impair a driver s attention.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Many state and local legislative bodies, including Alaska s, have passed legislation to restrict the use of wireless telephones while driving vehicles.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P95_S2	In Alaska all drivers are banned from texting while driving.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Concerns over safety and the effect of additional future legislation, if adopted and enforced in the areas we serve, could limit our ability to market and sell our wireless services.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries allegedly incurred as a result of wireless telephone use while driving could result in adverse publicity and further governmental regulation.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P95_S5	Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	A significant percentage of GCI s voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	As of December 31, 2012, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 11% of GCI s combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 22% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI s Board.
75679_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our properties do not lend themselves to description by location of principal units.
75679_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The majority of our properties are located in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	It is not practicable to allocate our properties to our reportable segments since many of our properties are employed by more than one segment to provide common services and products.
75679_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	Additionally our properties are managed at the consolidated company level rather than at the segment level.
75679_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We lease our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our properties consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.
75679_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	Substantially all of our properties are located on or in leased real property or facilities.
75679_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	Substantially all of our properties secure our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	See note 6 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.
75679_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are involved in various lawsuits, billing disputes, legal proceedings, and regulatory matters that have arisen from time to time in the normal course of business.
75679_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The range of possible losses from asserted and unasserted claims recorded and possibly recorded in the future do not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	In addition, in August 2010 a GCI-owned aircraft was involved in an accident resulting in five fatalities and injuries to the remaining four passengers on board.
75679_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	We had aircraft and liability insurance coverage in effect at the time of the accident.
75679_13_ITEM3_P0_S4	During 2012 final payments on all resolved claims were made with the exception of any potential claims for environmental remediation.
75679_13_ITEM3_P0_S5	All paid claims related to the accident have been resolved within insurance policy limits and were recorded net of these recoveries in our Consolidated Income Statements.
75679_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	We cannot predict the likelihood or nature of any potential claims for environmental remediation.
75679_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	All issued and outstanding shares of GCI, Inc's Class A common stock are held by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	GCI's Class A and Class B common stock are publicly traded.
75679_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	GCI and GCI, Inc. have never paid cash dividends on GCI s common stock, and we have no present intention of doing so.
75679_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	Payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be determined by GCI s Board of Directors in light of our earnings, financial condition and other relevant considerations.
75679_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	Our existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit payment of dividends on common stock, other than stock dividends (see note 6 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information) .
75679_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Computershare is GCI s stock transfer agent and registrar.
75679_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table presents selected historical information relating to financial condition and results of operations over the past five years.
75679_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	The Selected Financial Data should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	In the following discussion, GCI, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we, us and our.
75679_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables, unbilled revenues, accrual of the Universal Service Fund ( USF ) high cost Remote area program support, share-based compensation, inventory at lower of cost or market, reserve for future customer credits, liability for incurred but not reported medical insurance claims, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, depreciable and amortizable lives of assets, the carrying value of long-lived assets including goodwill, cable certificates and wireless licenses, our effective tax rate, purchase price allocations, deferred lease expense, asset retirement obligations, the accrual of cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) ("Cost of Goods Sold"), depreciation, and accrual of contingencies and litigation.
75679_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
75679_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	See also our Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska in 1997 to affect the issuance of Senior Notes.
75679_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	GCI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, received through its initial capitalization all ownership interests in subsidiaries previously held by GCI.
75679_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Shares of GCI s Class A common stock are traded on the Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol of GNCMA.
75679_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Shares of GCI s Class B common stock are traded on the Over-the-Counter market.
75679_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Shares of GCI, Inc. s common stock are wholly owned by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	The GCI and GCI, Inc. consolidated financial statements include substantially the same account activity.
75679_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins.
75679_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The national economy continues to see persistent unemployment and slow economic growth and even once stabilized is not expected to return quickly to a period of strong growth.
75679_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Should the national economy deteriorate further, it could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth.
75679_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	As discussed earlier in Item 1 Business Geographic Concentration and the Alaska Economy, we believe the Alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time.
75679_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	The State of Alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the short-term.
75679_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	This cash reserve is important for Alaska s economy as the State is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product.
75679_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	The majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the Alaska economy which appears to have weathered the economic pressures relatively well to date.
75679_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	Nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the nation s future economic situation may have on us in the future.
75679_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	On June 4, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement ( Wireless Agreement ) by and among Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. ( ACS ), GCI, ACS Wireless, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACS ( ACS Member ), GCI Wireless Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, and The Alaska Wireless Network, LLC ( AWN ), a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We entered into this agreement to provide a robust, statewide network with the spectrum mix, scale, advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with Verizon Wireless ( Verizon ) and AT T in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	After the transaction closes AWN will provide wholesale services to GCI and ACS.
75679_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	GCI and ACS will use the AWN network in order to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers.
75679_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	GCI and ACS will continue to compete against each other and other wireless providers in the retail market.
75679_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we agreed to purchase certain wireless network assets from ACS and its affiliates for $100.0 million and we will contribute the purchased assets, our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	ACS also agreed to contribute its remaining wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Upon the contribution of assets to AWN, ACS Member will own one-third of AWN and we will own two-thirds of AWN.
75679_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	ACS Member will be entitled to receive preferential cash distributions totaling $190.0 million over the first four years of AWN s operations and we will be entitled to all remaining cash distributions during that period.
75679_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	We anticipate that the $190.0 million preferential distributions to ACS will constitute approximately $80.0 million in distributions over the distributions otherwise attributable to their ownership percentage during such period.
75679_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Following the initial four year period, we and ACS Member will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests.
75679_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We are evaluating the accounting treatment for this transaction.
75679_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The closing of the transactions is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required governmental and third party consents and approvals and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods under competition laws.
75679_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired without any objections.
75679_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The transactions are expected to close by the second quarter of 2013.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	As an eligible telecommunications carrier ( ETC ), we receive support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless services in high cost areas.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	On November 29, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers ( High Cost Order ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The High Cost Order defined Urban and Remote areas and divided support to Alaska between these two areas.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers ( CETCs ) serving Urban areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau will follow national reforms, had support per provider per service area capped as of January 1, 2012, and a five-step phase-down commenced on July 1, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	In addition to broader reforms, the FCC tailored revisions specifically for CETCs serving Remote Alaska, intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	Support to these locations will continue to be distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S6	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_13_ITEM7_P13_S7	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local access and wireless services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	The High Cost Order Remote and Urban program changes primarily impacted our Consumer segment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The High Cost Order Remote and Urban program changes resulted in decreased Consumer segment voice revenue of approximately $1.6 million and decreased Consumer segment wireless revenue of approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	At December 31, 2012, we have $32.0 million and $3.6 million in Remote and Urban high cost accounts receivable, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ( USAC ) and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at affordable rates.
75679_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The order adopted several reforms but the only reform with a significant 2012 impact was a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012, to be completed by the end of 2012 subject to the waiver to perfect early recertification by January 31, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	The completion of the annual recertification process was the primary reason for our loss of approximately 10,000 Lifeline subscribers from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	We have recognized $14.2 million in Consumer wireless Lifeline revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The Lifeline program changes resulted in decreased Consumer segment wireless revenue of approximately $700,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, and estimated decreased Consumer segment revenue in the range of $1.3 million to $1.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	As a related matter, in April 2012 the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ( RCA ) issued a notice of inquiry to consider whether to modify the state-funded component of Lifeline support, which is currently $3.50 per month.
75679_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	In May 2012, we responded in favor of preserving the current level of support.
75679_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	We cannot predict the outcome of the support review proceedings or the impact on our income statement, financial position or cash flows.
75679_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	In November 2010, Verizon acquired a license for 700 MHz wireless spectrum covering Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Verizon began building a Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) network in 2012 and subsequently we expect they will be an additional competitor where our markets overlap.
75679_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	We cannot predict the potential impact this new competition may have on us in the future.
75679_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	As part of an agreement signed in December 2007 with AT T Mobility, AT T Mobility provided to us a large block of wireless network usage at no charge that we used for roaming.
75679_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	This block of minutes was depleted in January 2012 and our wireless Cost of Goods Sold for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased approximately $5.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, before factoring in the impact of 2012 non-Lifeline subscriber growth.
75679_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Our future wireless Cost of Goods Sold will depend on several factors including the impact and timing of our wireless network build-out, the pattern of usage by our wireless subscribers, and negotiated rates with our roaming partners.
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	On October 3, 2012, we entered into a second arrangement under the New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC ) program with US Bancorp for $12.9 million to fund the further extension of terrestrial broadband service to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network ( Phase 3 of TERRA-Northwest ) ( NMTC #2 ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	In connection with this NMTC #2 transaction we loaned $37.7 million to two special purpose entities created to effect the financing arrangement, at 1.0% interest due October 2, 2042.
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Simultaneously, US Bancorp invested $17.5 million in these special purpose entities, and as such, is entitled to substantially all of the benefits derived from the NMTCs.
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	The special purpose entities then contributed US Bancorp s contribution and the loan proceeds to certain community development entities ( CDEs ) less payment of placement fees of $3.2 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	The CDEs, in turn, loaned $52.0 million, at interest rates varying from 0.7099% to 0.7693%, to Unicom, Inc. ( Unicom ), our wholly owned subsidiary, as partial financing for Phase 3 of TERRA-Northwest ( TERRA-NW ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	The loan proceeds to Unicom, net of syndication and arrangement fees, are restricted for use on Phase 3 of TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	Restricted cash of $12.9 million was received by Unicom on October 3, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	On December 11, 2012, we entered into a third arrangement under the NMTC program with US Bancorp for $2.9 million for additional funding of Phase 3 of TERRA-NW ( NMTC #3 ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	In connection with this NMTC #3 transaction we loaned $8.2 million to a special purpose entity created to effect the financing arrangement, at 1.0% interest due December 10, 2042.
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Simultaneously, US Bancorp invested $3.8 million in this special purpose entity, and as such, is entitled to substantially all of the benefits derived from the NMTCs.
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	The special purpose entity then contributed US Bancorp s contribution and the loan proceeds to certain CDEs less payment of placement fees of $240,000.
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The CDEs, in turn, loaned $11.8 million, at 1.3472% interest rate, to Unicom as partial financing for Phase 3 of TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	The loan proceeds to Unicom, net of syndication and arrangement fees, are restricted for use on Phase 3 of TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	Restricted cash of $2.9 million was received by Unicom on December 11, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	We plan to begin construction on Phase 3 of TERRA-NW in 2013 and expect to complete the project in 2014.

75679_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The decrease in voice revenue is primarily due to:
75679_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	A 39% decrease in long-distance usage to $2.4 million due to the lower rates mandated by the Intrastate Access Reform Act ( Intrastate Access Reform ) which went into effect in July 2011, along with our introduction of a popular new plan offering unlimited interstate and intrastate calling which went into effect in August 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to:
75679_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	A 57% increase in excess usage revenue to $7.9 million due to customers moving from plans with unlimited usage to plans with limited usage.
75679_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to a 10% increase in plan fee revenue to $46.8 million due to our subscribers selection of plans that offer more data and an increase in non-Lifeline subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	This increase was partially offset by:
75679_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	A 16% decrease in Lifeline support to $14.2 million primarily due to decreased subscribers primarily resulting from the recertification program started in June 2012 and discussed above in the General Overview section of this Item 2.
75679_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The wireless Cost of Goods Sold increase is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment and roaming.
75679_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Our wireless handset equipment costs have increased because a higher percentage of our handsets sold have been premium smartphones which have a higher cost.
75679_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Additionally, we have experienced an increase in handset sales due to an increased number of handsets issued to new customers and those extending their service.
75679_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	The increase in roaming costs is due to the end of free network usage as discussed above in the General Overview section of this Item 7 and an increase in data usage by our customers.
75679_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The increase in smartphones resulted in an increase in data usage.
75679_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Consumer Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Consumer segment due to an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.

75679_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	The increase in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a $3.4 million or 10% increase in managed services project Cost of Goods Sold related to the increased revenue described above in Commercial Segment Revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA increase is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in Commercial Segment Revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	This increase was partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Commercial Segment Cost of Goods Sold and by an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Commercial segment primarily due to an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, Cost of Goods sold and Adjusted EBITDA represented 12%, 9% and 19% of 2012 consolidated revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, which includes data products only, increased 37% to $86.6 million in 2012 as compared to 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase is primarily due to:
75679_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Recognition of $1.6 million in previously denied funding from the USAC for one ConnectMD customer for the funding year July 2008 to June 2009.
75679_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	We had appealed the funding denial and received notice during the second quarter of 2012 that our appeal was successful and the funding was reinstated.
75679_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Managed Broadband segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $17.0 million in 2011 to $21.3 million in 2012 primarily due to Cost of Goods Sold associated with the product sales revenue described above in Managed Broadband Segment Revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Managed Broadband segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $42.8 million in 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenue as described above in "Managed Broadband Segment Revenues," partially offset by an increase in the Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Managed Broadband Segment Cost of Goods Sold, and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Managed Broadband segment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in the 2011 segment margin upon which the selling, general and administrative expense allocation is based and an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.

75679_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	$2.9 million in transaction costs related to the transactions described in the Wireless Agreement as discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 7.
75679_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 34% in 2012 from 35% in 2011, primarily due to increased revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.5 million to $130.5 million in 2012 primarily due to new assets placed in service in 2012 partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Other expense, net of other income, decreased 13% to $67.7 million in 2012 primarily due to the absence of a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	On May 23, 2011, GCI, Inc. , our wholly owned subsidiary, completed an offering of $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ) .
75679_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2014 .
75679_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Income tax expense totaled $12.1 million and $7.4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Our effective income tax rate was 57% in 2012 and 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	At December 31, 2012, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $293.3 million that will begin expiring in 2020 if not utilized, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.9 million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years.
75679_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $120.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2011 and that expire from 2020 to 2031, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2007, and that expire in 2024 through 2027, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 55% to 59% in the year ending December 31, 2013, primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences expected in 2013 as compared to our net income before income tax expense.
75679_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Total revenues increased 4% from $651.3 million in 2010 to $679.4 million in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	Revenue increases in our Consumer, Commercial and Managed Broadband segments were partially offset by decreased revenue in our Network Access and Regulated Operations segments.

75679_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a 19% increase in cable modem revenue to $63.4 million due to increased subscribers, rate increases in May and August 2010 and in May 2011, and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds.
75679_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The increase in video Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers, increased rates paid to programmers and increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered through our HD/DVR converter boxes.
75679_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	This increase was partially offset by decreased costs due to a decrease in subscribers.
75679_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	The wireless Cost of Goods Sold increase is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales and a change in the allocation of network maintenance costs.
75679_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	The increased wireless handset equipment sale costs are associated with an increased number of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs and an increased number of handsets issued to new customers and those extending their service.
75679_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	The change in allocation of network maintenance costs resulted in an increase to our Consumer segment and a decrease to our Network Access, Commercial and Managed Broadband segments.
75679_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Consumer Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Consumer segment due to an increase in the 2010 segment margin upon which the selling, general and administrative expense allocation is based and an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.

75679_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	The decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a $5.3 million Cost of Goods Sold classification change.
75679_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	Prior to 2011 certain Cost of Goods Sold were classified as Network Access segment voice Cost of Goods Sold.
75679_13_ITEM7_P116_S2	Beginning in 2011 these Cost of Goods Sold were reclassified to data Cost of Goods Sold for a more accurate presentation.
75679_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	The increase in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to:
75679_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	A $5.3 million Cost of Goods Sold classification change.

75679_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	Selected key performance indicators for our Commercial segment follow:
75679_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a $5.1 million or 13% increase in managed services project revenue due to special project work.
75679_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	The increase in data Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to a $4.7 million or 15% increase in managed services project Cost of Goods Sold related to the increased revenue described above in Commercial Segment Revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Adjusted EBITDA increase is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in Commercial Segment Revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	This increase was partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Commercial Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Commercial segment primarily due to an increase in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA represented 9%, 7% and 13% of 2011 consolidated revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	Managed Broadband segment revenue, which includes data products only, increased 27% to $63.2 million in 2011 as compared to 2010.
75679_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	The increase is primarily due to increased monthly contract revenue due to increased data network capacity purchased by our ConnectMD and SchoolAccess customers and absence of $1.7 million in denied funding from the USAC for one ConnectMD customer for the funding year July 2008 to June 2009.
75679_13_ITEM7_P131_S2	We received the funding commitment letter, which outlined the denied portion, in the second quarter of 2010.
75679_13_ITEM7_P131_S3	The denial was appealed to the FCC and we received notice during the second quarter of 2012 that our appeal was successful.
75679_13_ITEM7_P131_S4	We subsequently recognized $1.6 million in 2012 .
75679_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	Managed Broadband segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $14.0 million in 2010 to $17.0 million in 2011 primarily due to the increase in data network capacity described above in Managed Broadband Segment Revenues .
75679_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	Managed Broadband segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $28.6 million in 2011 primarily due to an increase in revenue as described above in "Managed Broadband Segment Revenues," partially offset by an increase in the Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Managed Broadband Segment Cost of Goods Sold, and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was allocated to our Managed Broadband segment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in the consolidated selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.

75679_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Regulated Operations segment Cost of Goods Sold increased from $4.4 million in 2010 to $5.8 million in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	Beginning July 1, 2011, our Regulated Segment began purchasing access to carry its traffic in certain regions from our Network Access Segment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	Prior to this the traffic in these regions was carried on its own network plant.
75679_13_ITEM7_P139_S3	Under regulatory accounting these intercompany transactions are not eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	Regulated Operations segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 55% to $2.8 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in revenue, an increase in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in Regulated Operations Segment Cost of Goods Sold and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense that was recorded in our Regulated Operations segment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to non-capitalizable TERRA-SW expenses recorded in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.7 million to $235.5 million in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	Individually significant items contributing to the increase include:
75679_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	A $1.2 million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to absence of settlements which resulted in the release of credit reserves in the third quarter of 2010 .
75679_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	These increases were partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in our company-wide success sharing bonus accrual.
75679_13_ITEM7_P144_S1	The remainder of the increase is comprised of individually insignificant items.
75679_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 35% in 2011 and 2010.
75679_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $762,000 to $125.9 million in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	Other expense, net of other income, increased 11% to $77.6 million in 2011 primarily due to a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt.
75679_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	On May 23, 2011, GCI, Inc. , our wholly owned subsidiary, completed an offering of $325 . 0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes.
75679_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all of our outstanding 2014 Notes .
75679_13_ITEM7_P148_S2	This increase was partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in interest expense to $68.3 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P148_S3	The interest expense decrease is primarily due to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, which have a lower interest rate than the interest rate paid on our 2014 Notes.
75679_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_13_ITEM7_P149_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	Income tax expense totaled $7.4 million and $9.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	Our effective income tax rate increased from 52% in 2010 to 57% in 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our Consumer and Commercial segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities.
75679_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	The standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service utilizing our cable service facilities, encompassing voice, video, and data services, without regard to which services customers purchase.
75679_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 we had 126,700, 129,400, and 134,400 customer relationships, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	The standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary digital video, high-speed data, and telephony customers, not counting additional outlets.
75679_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 we had 343,900, 345,900, and 350,100 revenue generating units, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	As discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 7, in June 2012 we entered into a Wireless Agreement with ACS.
75679_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we agreed to purchase certain wireless network assets from ACS and its affiliates for $100.0 million and we will contribute the purchased assets, our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_13_ITEM7_P155_S2	We have also agreed to provide AWN a $50.0 million working capital line of credit.
75679_13_ITEM7_P155_S3	We expect to finance the asset purchase and working capital line of credit by refinancing our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	ACS Member will be entitled to receive preferential cash distributions totaling $190.0 million over the first four years of AWN s operations and we will be entitled to all remaining cash distributions during that period.
75679_13_ITEM7_P156_S1	We anticipate that the $190.0 million preferential distributions to ACS will constitute approximately $80.0 million in excess of the distributions otherwise attributable to their ownership percentage during such period.
75679_13_ITEM7_P156_S2	Currently we do not expect the preference payments will result in a significant decrease in our liquidity but should the payments cause a significant decrease our non-wireless capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	Following the initial four year period, we and ACS Member will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests.
75679_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	We will manage AWN and receive a management fee of 4% of free cash flow as defined in the Wireless Agreement in the first two years of operations.
75679_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	The management fee will increase to 6% in the third and fourth years of the agreement and 8% after the fourth year of the agreement.
75679_13_ITEM7_P158_S2	The management fee will be paid before distributions to the owners.
75679_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	In July 2012, we received payment for the sale of a $4.5 million IRU.
75679_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	On August 30, 2011, we entered into a financing arrangement under the NMTC program ( NMTC #1 ) which provided $16.5 million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network.
75679_13_ITEM7_P160_S1	When completed, the project, called TERRA-NW, will connect to our TERRA-SW network and provide a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the Internet.
75679_13_ITEM7_P160_S2	On October 3, 2012, and December 11, 2012, we entered into NMTC #2 and NMTC #3, respectively, which provided $12.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in net cash to help fund additional phases of our TERRA-NW project.
75679_13_ITEM7_P160_S3	We began construction on TERRA-NW in 2012 and expect to complete the project in 2014 or earlier if possible.
75679_13_ITEM7_P160_S4	The total net cash received under NMTC #1, NMTC #2 and NMTC #3 is recorded as Restricted Cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
75679_13_ITEM7_P160_S5	We have used $10.6 million of Restricted Cash to fund TERRA-NW capital expenditures through December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	In September 2011, the RCA approved our application for a $5.3 million grant to help fund TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM7_P161_S1	The grant was increased to $6.3 million in January 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P161_S2	We received $5.7 million in grant funds during 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P161_S3	The NMTC arrangements discussed above and this grant award partially fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P161_S4	We plan to fund an additional $20.7 million for TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	I auction for a $3.2 million grant to partially fund expansion of our 3G wireless network to high cost rural locations in Alaska.
75679_13_ITEM7_P162_S1	Upon review we agreed to accept $2.3 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P162_S2	Upon FCC authorization of our final application submission, which is currently pending, we plan to begin construction in 2013 and expect to complete the project in 2014.
75679_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	As discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 7, in November 2012 we entered into the Media Agreements pursuant to which we agreed to purchase three Alaska broadcast stations for a total of $7.6 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	The Media Agreements are subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required governmental approvals from the FCC.
75679_13_ITEM7_P163_S2	The transactions are expected to close in the second half of 2013.
75679_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_13_ITEM7_P165_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	Our net cash flows provided by and (used for) operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2012 and 2011, are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2011 to 2012 is due primarily to:
75679_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	A decrease in accrued interest in 2011 due to a change in due dates for semi-annual interest payments on our 2021 Notes as compared to the senior unsecured notes due 2014 that were retired.
75679_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures.
75679_13_ITEM7_P169_S1	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_13_ITEM7_P169_S2	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $146.0 million and $177.1 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	Our capital expenditures decreased in 2012 primarily due to our TERRA-SW project which was placed into service December 30, 2011.
75679_13_ITEM7_P170_S2	Depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2013, we expect our 2013 expenditures from unrestricted cash for property and equipment, including construction in progress, for our core and non-core operations, to total approximately $150.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	Under our TERRA-SW Rural Utilities Service ( RUS ) award, we had total available grant funds of $44.0 million.

75679_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	In 2012, we received $15.8 million in restricted cash from participating in NMTC#2 and NMTC#3 financing transactions.
75679_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	The cash is restricted for construction of TERRA-NW.
75679_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities in 2012 consists primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our Supplement No. 3 under our Senior Credit Facility, borrowing under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility, borrowing under our TERRA-SW RUS loan and investments by US Bancorp, a non-controlling interest.
75679_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	These proceeds were offset by repayments under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facility, repayments of RUS debt and repurchases of GCI s common stock.
75679_13_ITEM7_P174_S2	Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_13_ITEM7_P174_S3	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI s common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	We have a facility which includes an $80.0 million term loan and a $75.0 million revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit ( Senior Credit Facility ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P175_S1	The term loan is fully drawn at December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P175_S2	Under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility we have borrowed $10.0 million and have $349,000 of letters of credit outstanding, which leaves $64.7 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P175_S3	A total of $90.0 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2012.

75679_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	Under our TERRA-SW RUS award, we had total available loan funds of $44.2 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	We have borrowed $4.8 million in loan funds in 2012 for a total borrowing of $40.0 million in loan funds under this award through December 31, 2012, leaving $4.2 million remaining loan funds available as of December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	We are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our 2021 Notes, our $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.63% Senior Notes due 2019, our Senior Credit Facility, our RUS loans, and our CoBank loans.
75679_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.
75679_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	Under this program, GCI is currently authorized to make up to $101.0 million of repurchases as of December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P179_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_13_ITEM7_P179_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	During 2012 we repurchased, on GCI s behalf, 1.5 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $14.0 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	The common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage, liquidity, company performance, and market conditions and subject to continued oversight by GCI s Board of Directors.
75679_13_ITEM7_P180_S2	The open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of SEC Rule 10b-18.
75679_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 (amounts in thousands):
75679_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our Senior Credit Facility, 2019 and 2021 Notes, Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable.
75679_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	Interest on the amount outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility is based on variable rates.
75679_13_ITEM7_P183_S1	We used the current rate paid on the Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments.
75679_13_ITEM7_P183_S2	Our 2019 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $18.3 million through November 2019 and our 2021 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.0 million through June 2021.
75679_13_ITEM7_P183_S3	Our Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from 2.4% to 4.5%.
75679_13_ITEM7_P183_S4	For a discussion of our 2019 and 2021 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, Rural Utilities Services debt and CoBank Mortgage note payable see note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	Capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_13_ITEM7_P184_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see note 13 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	Purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling $31.7 million which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2012 .
75679_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose and off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2012 - 02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment allows an entity to assess qualitative factors (such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, key technology or customers) to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired and thus whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with GAAP.
75679_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2013.
75679_13_ITEM7_P187_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our income statements, financial position or cash flows.
75679_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	ASU 2012-04, Technical Corrections and Improvements includes amendments that cover a wide range of topics in the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ).
75679_13_ITEM7_P188_S1	These amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the ASC and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P188_S2	The amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	The adoption of ASU 2012-04 is not expected to have a material impact on our income statements, financial position or cash flows.
75679_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_13_ITEM7_P190_S2	The financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_13_ITEM7_P192_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P192_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI s Audit Committee.
75679_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2012 are described below.
75679_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	The accounting estimates related to revenues from the Remote high cost, rural health and schools and libraries USF programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap, our assessment of the impact of new FCC regulations, the potential outcome of FCC proceedings and the potential outcome of USAC contract reviews.
75679_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	Some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods.
75679_13_ITEM7_P194_S2	Significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	We maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	We also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the USAC for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals, health clinics and school districts.
75679_13_ITEM7_P195_S2	We base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, changes in our collections process, regulatory requirements, and our customers compliance with USAC rules .
75679_13_ITEM7_P195_S3	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
75679_13_ITEM7_P195_S4	If their financial condition improves, or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings, allowances may be reduced.
75679_13_ITEM7_P195_S5	Such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	We had $294.9 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2012, consisting of cable certificates of $191.6 million, goodwill of $77.3 million and wireless licenses of $26.0 million.
75679_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	In our annual test over goodwill we are allowed to first assess qualitative factors ( Step Zero ) to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
75679_13_ITEM7_P197_S1	We chose not to apply Step Zero and instead went straight to assessing for goodwill impairment using the traditional quantitative two-step process.
75679_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
75679_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
75679_13_ITEM7_P198_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_13_ITEM7_P198_S3	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
75679_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	We chose not to early adopt ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, which would have allowed us to apply a Step Zero in our annual test over our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill.
75679_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
75679_13_ITEM7_P200_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_13_ITEM7_P201_S0	Our cable certificates are our largest indefinite-lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_13_ITEM7_P201_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_13_ITEM7_P201_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is primarily from cable system acquisitions.
75679_13_ITEM7_P202_S0	The cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics.
75679_13_ITEM7_P203_S0	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_13_ITEM7_P203_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_13_ITEM7_P203_S2	We use comparable market transactions from recent FCC auctions, as appropriate, and a hypothetical build-up method to value our wireless licenses.
75679_13_ITEM7_P204_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_13_ITEM7_P204_S1	We use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
75679_13_ITEM7_P204_S2	In addition, a market-based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach.
75679_13_ITEM7_P205_S0	The direct discounted cash flow, hypothetical build-up, and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows, discount rate, customer churn, and customer behaviors and attrition.
75679_13_ITEM7_P205_S1	These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge.
75679_13_ITEM7_P206_S0	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.
75679_13_ITEM7_P206_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
75679_13_ITEM7_P206_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
75679_13_ITEM7_P206_S3	Events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces, customer behaviors, change in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, performance compared to peers, material and ongoing negative economic trends, and specific industry or market sector conditions.
75679_13_ITEM7_P207_S0	Our company is operated and managed with two balance sheets, however, our impairment tests must be performed at the reporting unit level, which requires us to allocate one of our balance sheets .
75679_13_ITEM7_P207_S1	These allocations are subjective and require a significant amount of judgment.
75679_13_ITEM7_P207_S2	Changes to the assumptions and allocation methodologies could significantly change our estimates.
75679_13_ITEM7_P207_S3	We may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions, expected future operating results, or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill, cable certificates, and wireless licenses.
75679_13_ITEM7_P208_S0	We have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2012, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between 15% and 123%.
75679_13_ITEM7_P208_S1	The reporting unit that exceeded the book value by 15% passed the goodwill impairment test by $97.9 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_13_ITEM7_P208_S2	We believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
75679_13_ITEM7_P209_S0	Based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2012, the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by 29% and $55.4 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_13_ITEM7_P209_S1	The fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 8% and $2.0 million as of October 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM7_P209_S2	The fair value of our wireless licenses was negatively affected by increases in our forecasted wireless Cost of Goods Sold for handset and data roaming costs.
75679_13_ITEM7_P210_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P210_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $120.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2011, and that primarily expire from 2020 to 2031, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 to 2007, and that expire in 2024 to 2027, respectively.
75679_13_ITEM7_P210_S2	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $1.9 million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire.
75679_13_ITEM7_P210_S3	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_13_ITEM7_P210_S4	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012, based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_13_ITEM7_P210_S5	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_13_ITEM7_P211_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P211_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_13_ITEM7_P212_S0	See Part I Item 1 Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_13_ITEM7_P213_S0	We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Our Senior Credit Facility carries interest rate risk.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Amounts borrowed under our Senior Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 4.0% or less depending upon our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) for the revolving portion and LIBOR plus 2.5% for the term portion.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Should the LIBOR rate change, our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we have borrowed $90.0 million subject to interest rate risk.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	On this amount, each 1% increase in the LIBOR interest rate would result in $900,000 of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis.
75679_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	All of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate.
75679_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are filed under this Item, beginning on page 67.
75679_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our supplementary data is filed under Item 7, beginning on page 42.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO).
75679_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2012, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P6_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P6_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.
75679_13_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are omitted per General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K.

75679_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Financial Information about Industry Segments Effective January 1, 2013, we refocused our business and now have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline.
75679_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Wireless segment s revenue is derived from wholesale wireless services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Wireline segment s revenue includes all of our other revenue, specifically a full range of retail wireless, data, video and voice services to residential, local, national and global businesses and non-profit and governmental entities.
75679_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	This change reflects our plan to strategically focus on our wireless network and is how our chief operating decision maker now measures performance and makes resource allocation decisions.
75679_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Prior to 2013 we had operated our business under five reportable segments Consumer, Network Access, Commercial, Managed Broadband and Regulated Operations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	The historical segment data has been reclassified to conform to the revised reportable segments.
75679_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	For financial information about our reportable segments, see Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Also refer to note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
75679_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	General We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues.
75679_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	We offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, data services, Internet access, video services and local and long-distance voice services, to residential and business customers across the state under our GCI brand.
75679_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
75679_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	We benefit from the attractive demographic and economic characteristics of Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Since GCI's founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets.
75679_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.
75679_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	In recent years, we expanded our efforts in wireless and presently operate the only statewide wireless network.
75679_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated consolidated revenues of $811.6 million .
75679_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	We ended the period with 141,500 wireless subscribers, 129,300 cable modem subscribers and 136,700 basic video subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	On July 22, 2013, we closed the transactions under the Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement ( Wireless Agreement ) and other related agreements entered into on June 4, 2012 by and among Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. ( ACS ), GCI, ACS Wireless, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACS, GCI Wireless Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, and The Alaska Wireless Network, LLC ("AWN"), pursuant to which the parties agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	AWN operates a statewide wireless communications network with the spectrum mix, scale, advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with Verizon Wireless and AT T Mobility in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	AWN provides wholesale services to GCI and ACS.
75679_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	GCI and ACS use the AWN network in order to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	GCI and ACS continue to compete against each other and other wireless providers in the retail market for wireless communications.
75679_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we contributed our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Additionally, ACS contributed its wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	As consideration for the contributed business assets and liabilities, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, a one-third ownership interest in AWN and entitlements to receive preferential cash distributions totaling $190.0 million over the first four years of AWN s operations ("Preference Period") contingent on the future cash flows of AWN.
75679_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	The preferential cash distribution is cumulative and may be paid beyond the Preference Period until the entire $190.0 million is paid.
75679_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	ACS's preferential cash distributions are expected to be higher than that which they would receive from their one-third interest.
75679_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	The distributions to each member are subject to adjustment based on the number of ACS and GCI wireless subscribers, with the aggregate adjustment capped at $21.8 million for each member over the Preference Period.
75679_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Following the Preference Period, we and ACS will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests.
75679_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	On November 1, 2013, we closed two transactions pursuant to which Denali Media Holdings, Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Denali Media Anchorage, Corp. and Denali Media Southeast, Corp., agreed to purchase three Alaska broadcast television stations: CBS affiliate KTVA-TV of Anchorage and NBC affiliates KATH-TV in Juneau and KSCT-TV of Sitka, for a total of $7.6 million.
75679_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Denali Media Holdings will provide a new statewide platform for news and information and we expect to provide unique content and value for our video subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	We intend to continue to increase revenues using the following strategies:
75679_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We offer innovative service bundles to meet the needs of our consumer and commercial customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	We believe that bundling our services significantly improves customer retention, increases revenue per customer and reduces customer acquisition expenses.
75679_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our experience indicates that our bundled customers are significantly less likely to churn, and we experience less price erosion when we effectively combine our offerings.
75679_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	Bundling improves our top line revenue growth, provides operating cost efficiencies that expand our margins and drives our overall business performance.
75679_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	As a measure of success to date, over 77,800 of our residential customers subscribe to one of our service bundles that include two or more services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We successfully sell new and enhanced services and products to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.
75679_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
75679_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have positioned ourselves as a customer service leader in the Alaska communications market.
75679_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	We operate our own customer service department and have empowered our customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call.
75679_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	We prioritize our customer services to expedite handling of our most valuable customers issues, particularly for our largest commercial customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	We believe our integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows us to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
75679_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	We continue to expand and evolve our integrated network for the delivery of our services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving our customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization.
75679_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	By offering multiple services, we are better able to leverage our network assets and increase returns on our invested capital.
75679_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	We periodically evaluate our network assets and continually monitor technological developments that we can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
75679_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Expand Our Product Portfolio and Footprint in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Throughout our history, we have successfully added and expect to continue to add new products to our product portfolio.
75679_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	We have a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for our customers, and we continue to assess revenue-enhancing opportunities that create value for our customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of our network coverage, we are currently pursuing or expect to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of our facilities, enhance our ability to serve our existing customers needs and attract new customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions of in-state telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our management team will continue to actively pursue and make investments that we believe fit with our strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.

75679_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Facilities We own statewide wireless facilities that cover most of the Alaska population providing service to urban and rural communities and we will continue to expand these networks throughout Alaska in 2014.
75679_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	We own a statewide wireless network that use GSM/HSPA+, CDMA/EVDO and Long Term Evolution ("LTE").
75679_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	We own Wi-Fi access points that create a Wi-Fi network branded as TurboZone in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kenai-Soldotna, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other areas of the State ("TurboZone").
75679_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Major Customer We had no major customer in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
75679_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Competition Our Wireless segment competes with AT T, Verizon, and smaller companies.
75679_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	We compete in the wholesale wireless market by offering competitive rates and by providing a comprehensive statewide network to meet the needs of carrier customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Seasonality Wireless segment wireless services revenues derived from our carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction, commercial fishing, and oil and gas activities.
75679_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Wireline Segment Wireline segment revenues for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Wireline segment.
75679_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Services and Products Our Wireline segment offers services and products to three major customer groups as follows:
75679_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Consumer - We offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video and voice services to residential customers.

75679_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Sales and Marketing We offer our services directly to consumer and business services customers through our call center, direct mail advertising, television advertising, Internet advertising, local media advertising, and through our retail stores.
75679_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities.
75679_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	We sell our managed services through direct contact marketing.
75679_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Facilities We operate a modern, competitive communications network providing switched and dedicated voice and broadband services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our fiber network employs digital transmission technology over our fiber optic facilities within Alaska and between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
75679_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our facilities include digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 states, a terrestrial fiber optic cable system connecting Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska along the Parks Highway corridor and a terrestrial fiber optic cable system that extends from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to Valdez, Alaska via Fairbanks, Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	We serve many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications.
75679_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up on alternate spacecraft with multiple backup transponders.
75679_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	We also operate a digital microwave systems to link Anchorage with the Kenai Peninsula.
75679_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	Additionally, we operate a hybrid fiber optic cable and digital microwave system ( TERRA ) linking Anchorage with the Bristol Bay and Yukon-Kuskokwim, and Northwest regions of the state.
75679_14_ITEM1_P48_S4	This system serves communities in those regions with interstate Ethernet and time-division multiplexing ("TDM") services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P48_S5	The network is fully digital, computer controlled, centrally monitored and supports multiple services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our statewide cable systems consist of cable plant having 450 to 920 MHz of channel capacity.
75679_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our video businesses are located throughout Alaska and serve 41 communities and areas in Alaska, including the state s five largest population centers, Anchorage, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, and Juneau.
75679_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our facilities include cable plant and head-end distribution equipment.
75679_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	The majority of our locations on the fiber routes are served from head-end distribution equipment in Anchorage.
75679_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	All of our cable systems are completely digital.
75679_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol/MPLS data services are delivered to an Ethernet port located at the service point.
75679_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our management platform constantly monitors this port and continual communications are maintained with all of the core and distribution elements in the network.
75679_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.
75679_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	The management platform has the capability to remotely access routers, servers and layer two switches, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service point.
75679_14_ITEM1_P50_S4	This management platform allows us to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
75679_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Competition We operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment and information products and services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior.
75679_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	For example, companies continue to emerge that offer services and devices that enable digital distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, and wireless services and devices continue to evolve.
75679_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	Moreover, newer services that distribute video programming are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content.
75679_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	These new alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content have been, and will likely continue to be, developed, and will continue to further increase the number of competitors we face.
75679_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition We compete with AT T, Verizon, ACS, and other community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.
75679_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	The national wireless carriers with whom we compete, AT T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than ours.
75679_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.
75679_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	As discussed in Development of Our Business During the Past Fiscal Year section of this Item 1, we have completed the creation of AWN, which should enhance our ability to compete against the national carriers on all resource fronts.
75679_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, bundled services, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, statewide network coverage and capacity, TurboZone, the type of wireless handsets offered, and the availability of differentiated features and services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Competition is based upon price and pricing plans, service bundles, the types of services offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	We compete with other Alaska based Internet providers and domestic, non-Alaska based providers that provide national service coverage.
75679_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	Several of the providers headquartered outside of Alaska have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	With respect to our high-speed cable modem service, ACS and other Alaska telephone service providers are providing competitive high-speed data subscriber line services over their telephone lines in direct competition with our high-speed cable modem service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") providers and local fixed wireless providers supply wireless high-speed Internet service in competition with our high-speed cable modem services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	We also provide metro-Ethernet fiber optic and dedicated access Internet products primarily for our business services customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Niche providers in the industry, both local and national, compete with certain of our Internet service products, such as web hosting, list services and e-mail.
75679_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
75679_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems.
75679_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone.
75679_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
75679_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Our video systems face competition from services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, as well as alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals, including DBS, digital video over telephone lines, broadband IP-based services, wireless and satellite master antenna television systems.
75679_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems.
75679_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Online video services via the Internet are a major growing source of competition for our video services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow Internet average revenue per subscriber.
75679_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe that the greatest source of external competition for our video services comes from the DBS industry.
75679_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	Two major companies, DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering nationwide high-power DBS services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Competitive forces will be counteracted by offering expanded programming through digital services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Digital delivery technology is being utilized in all of our systems.
75679_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	We have retransmission agreements with various broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into certain of our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	Additionally, our 2013 purchase of three television stations provides us the opportunity to create unique content for our subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.
75679_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry (such as the public utilities that own certain of the poles on which cable is attached) may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
75679_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Voice Services and Products Competition Our most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_14_ITEM1_P70_S3	We also compete against Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"), long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance.
75679_14_ITEM1_P70_S4	We have competed by offering excellent customer service, cross product discounts, and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Seasonality Our Wireline segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Sales and Marketing Company-wide Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, Internet and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Environmental Regulations We may undertake activities that, under certain circumstances affect the environment.
75679_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	Accordingly, they are subject to federal, state, and local regulations designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.
75679_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
75679_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon.
75679_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Some facilities may be on wetlands that may be subject to state and/or federal regulation.
75679_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	We are unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
75679_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses We do not hold patents, franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	We hold a number of federally registered service marks used by our reportable segments.
75679_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	We hold licenses for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Wireline segment.
75679_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	We hold various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use.
75679_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	These licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	However, we expect these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
75679_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	We hold licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years.
75679_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area.
75679_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Regulation Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	Wireless Services and Products General .
75679_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	As wireless licensees, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
75679_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, and registration of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas on towers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Universal Service Fund ("USF") pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the Matanuska Telephone Association, Inc. ("MTA") study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	Support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers ( CETCs ) serving areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau followed national reforms and had support per provider per service area capped as of January 1, 2012, and a five-step phase-down commenced on July 1, 2012.
75679_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Support to these locations is capped and distributed on a per-line basis until the later of July 1, 2014, or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing local services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	The order adopted several reforms, but the only reform with a significant 2012 impact was a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers enrolled as of June 1, 2012 to be completed by the end of 2012.
75679_14_ITEM1_P91_S2	In an order released on December 27, 2012, the FCC s Wireline Competition Bureau granted GCI a waiver to permit early recertification of subscribers (those recertified prior to June 1, 2012), subject to the condition that certain address information be verified for a subset of those subscribers by January 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	We have completed negotiation and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks for more information.
75679_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s phone number and approximate location.
75679_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters recently revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	Due to Alaska s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.
75679_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC s standard.
75679_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P99_S2	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to our customers and result in higher costs to our customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Internet-based Services and Products General .
75679_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the Internet.
75679_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_14_ITEM1_P103_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	Although the FCC does not regulate the prices charged by Internet service providers or Internet backbone providers, the vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_14_ITEM1_P105_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	On November 20, 2011, the FCC issued rules governing the activities of cable operators and other Internet service providers in connection with the provision of Internet service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	The rules generally prohibited blocking lawful content and prohibiting unreasonable discrimination, outside of reasonable network management, as well as imposing transparency requirements.
75679_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	On January 14, 2014, in a case challenging these rules, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules, upheld the transparency rules, and remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.
75679_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	The majority opinion held that the FCC possessed the general statutory authority to adopt these rules, but did so in a manner that contravened specific statutory prohibitions against imposing common carrier regulations on non-telecommunications services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P107_S1	The remand leaves open the possibility that the FCC could reclassify broadband services as telecommunication services subject to common carrier regulation or adopt different regulations that do not rise to the level of per se common carrier obligations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P107_S2	We do not view the upheld requirements as significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P107_S3	In addition, these rules are subject to court appeals.
75679_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	On February 19, 2014, the FCC Chairman announced that he would initiate a proceeding to establish new rules.
75679_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	Further, FCC regulation or legislative proposals under the banner of net neutrality, if adopted, could interfere with our ability to reasonably manage and invest in our broadband network, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P110_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	The RCA is also certified under federal law to regulate rates for the basic service tier on our video systems.
75679_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	Under state law, however, video service is exempt from regulation unless subscribers petition the RCA.
75679_14_ITEM1_P111_S2	At present, regulation of basic video rates takes place only in Juneau.
75679_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P114_S1	The FCC requirement that cable operators carry both the analog and digital programming streams of broadcast television stations while broadcasters are transitioning from analog to digital transmission does not apply to all-digital systems like ours.
75679_14_ITEM1_P114_S2	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	Cable System Delivery of Internet Service.
75679_14_ITEM1_P115_S1	The FCC has defined high-speed Internet over cable as an information service not subject to local cable franchise fees, as video service may be, or any explicit requirements for open access.
75679_14_ITEM1_P115_S2	The Supreme Court affirmed the FCC s position in a decision issued in 2005.
75679_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	Although there is at present no significant federal regulation of cable system delivery of Internet services, proposals previously have been advanced at the FCC and before Congress to require cable operators to provide access to unaffiliated Internet service providers and online service providers and to govern the terms under which content providers and applications are delivered by all broadband network operators.
75679_14_ITEM1_P116_S1	If such requirements were imposed on cable operators, it could burden the capacity of cable systems and frustrate our plans for providing expanded Internet access services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P116_S2	These access obligations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	The FCC mandated, effective July 1, 2007, that all new set-top video navigation devices must segregate the security function from the navigation function.
75679_14_ITEM1_P117_S1	The new devices are more expensive than existing equipment, and compliance would increase our cost of providing video services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P117_S2	Subject to a waiver granted by the FCC on May 4, 2007, we may continue providing low-cost integrated set-top boxes to consumers to facilitate our all-digital cable networks.
75679_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	On April 21, 2010, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry to consider ways to develop a standardized interface for accessing video content, as an alternative to set-top boxes.
75679_14_ITEM1_P118_S1	Adoption of new rules or standards in this area could affect the manner in which we deliver video products to our customers.
75679_14_ITEM1_P118_S2	We do not know if the FCC will propose rules for further consideration.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S5	In addition, on April 7, 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P119_S6	The United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, recently upheld the FCC s rules, denying challenges from several utility companies.
75679_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	Though the general purpose of rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.
75679_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_14_ITEM1_P121_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_14_ITEM1_P121_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast program ming.
75679_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	Wireline Voice Services and Products General.
75679_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P124_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the RCA and the FCC as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P124_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_14_ITEM1_P125_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P125_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service for information on USF reform.
75679_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_14_ITEM1_P128_S1	We have had to participate in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs, including ACS for its Fairbanks and Juneau operating companies, MTA and Ketchikan Public Utilities, in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_14_ITEM1_P128_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_14_ITEM1_P129_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Consumer Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_14_ITEM1_P132_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published a final rule to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_14_ITEM1_P132_S2	We do not anticipate that the adopted changes, for which implementation began in 2012, will have a material impact on our operations, except that the reduction of interstate access rates generally will result in a cost savings on access charges to us.
75679_14_ITEM1_P132_S3	However, the details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and they could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_14_ITEM1_P132_S4	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_14_ITEM1_P133_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be sustained in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rules that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_14_ITEM1_P133_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_14_ITEM1_P133_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	Recurring and non-recurring charges for UNE loops and other UNEs may increase based on the rates adopted in RCA proceedings to establish new Interconnection Agreements or renew existing agreements.
75679_14_ITEM1_P134_S1	These increases could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_14_ITEM1_P135_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_14_ITEM1_P135_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	The 1996 Telecom Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks.
75679_14_ITEM1_P137_S1	On January 30, 2014, the FCC adopted an order calling for experiments to examine how best to accelerate the technological and regulatory transitions from traditional TDM-based networks to IP-based technologies.
75679_14_ITEM1_P137_S2	These proceedings are in early stages, and we cannot predict any resulting proceedings or their effect on us; however, a change in regulatory obligation or classification that interfered with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
75679_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	On December 12, 2012, the FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund to supplement the existing Rural Health Care Program of the USF.
75679_14_ITEM1_P139_S0	existing Rural Health Care Program or the new Healthcare Connect Fund.
75679_14_ITEM1_P139_S1	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this change but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_14_ITEM1_P140_S0	On July 23, 2013, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment regarding potential changes to the Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate") to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide.
75679_14_ITEM1_P140_S1	We cannot at this time predict the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on E-Rate support available to our schools and libraries customers, but our revenue for providing services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of E-Rate support.
75679_14_ITEM1_P141_S0	Recently, the SEC adopted new rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act setting forth new disclosure requirements concerning the use of certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.
75679_14_ITEM1_P141_S1	These new disclosure requirements begin in May 2014.
75679_14_ITEM1_P141_S2	We believe these disclosure requirements will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1_P142_S0	We do not have significant foreign operations or export sales.
75679_14_ITEM1_P142_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_14_ITEM1_P143_S0	Company-Sponsored Research We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_14_ITEM1_P144_S0	We offer wireless, data and voice telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1_P144_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska, and we believe the Alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time.
75679_14_ITEM1_P145_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries, and in particular oil production, as well as government spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_14_ITEM1_P145_S1	The government spending is comprised of state government and United States military spending.
75679_14_ITEM1_P145_S2	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us.
75679_14_ITEM1_P146_S0	Employees We employed 1,924 persons as of December 31, 2013, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_14_ITEM1_P146_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_14_ITEM1_P146_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_14_ITEM1_P147_S0	Other No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We face increased wireless services competition from the 2013 entrance of Verizon into the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Item 1 Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers perceptions of our services, and customer care quality.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Managing these factors and subscribers expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	AT T Wireless and Verizon have national networks which enable them to offer automatic roaming services to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We believe that the rates charged to us by some of these carriers are higher than the rates they charge to certain other roaming partners.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The FCC has adopted rules requiring commercial mobile radio service providers to provide automatic roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The FCC has also adopted rules generally requiring carriers to offer data roaming services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If we were unexpectedly to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to successfully manage the new operations of AWN or Denali Media.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The formation, with ACS, of AWN is crucial to our strategy to remain competitive in wireless services against the national wireless carriers offering services in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We may not be able to successfully integrate the network facilities or recognize the expected synergies which may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in our business and financial performance.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The diversion of management s attention or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We may also incur unforeseen expenses in connection with the integration efforts.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	There can be no assurance that the expense savings and synergies that we anticipated from the transaction will be realized fully or will be realized within the expected timeframe.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may not be able to successfully manage the acquired broadcast stations or recognize the expected synergies with our video services business which may cause interruptions of or loss of momentum in our business and financial performance.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The diversion of management s attention or difficulties encountered in connection with this acquisition may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may also incur unforeseen expenses in connection with the management efforts.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	There can be no assurance that the synergies that we anticipate from the transaction will be realized fully or will be realized within the expected timeframe.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Although the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The FCC has initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Changes proposed by the FCC could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operating costs.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The FCC has adopted rule changes that require local notice in any community in which it is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	This rule change could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Proposals may be made before Congress and the FCC to mandate that cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to Internet service providers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As of the date of this report, the FCC has declined to impose such requirements.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If the FCC or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems, we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our Internet service offerings.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in the regulatory environment relating to the Internet access market, including changes in legislation, FCC regulation, judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ILEC or other communications services providers, could adversely affect the prices at which we sell Internet services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Currently, pursuant to Alaska law, the basic video rates in Juneau are the only rates in Alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority; the basic rates in Juneau were reviewed and approved by the RCA in July 2010.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network, to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to UNEs.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In some Alaska markets, it also depends on our ability to gain interconnection at economic costs.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This support was 19% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We had USF net receivables of $124.3 million and $70.1 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireless Services and Products Universal Service and Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, as we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The decline in our Wireline segment voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We expect our Wireline voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our local access services and long-distance subscribers and revenues will continue to decline and possibly accelerate.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We expect to continue to strategically use certain marketing and bundling strategies to slow the decline but we do not expect these strategies will significantly impact or stop the decline.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit program for funding our TERRA-NW project.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In 2011 and 2012 we entered into three separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA-NW project.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which are restricted for use on TERRA-NW.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $56.0 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in December 2019.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Failure to complete development, testing and deployment of a new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We offer wireless, data and voice telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries, and in particular oil production, as well as government spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The government spending is comprised of state government and United States military spending.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Any deterioration in these markets or the occurrence of a single disruptive event, such as a shut-down of the TransAlaska Pipeline System, could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Additionally, the customer base in Alaska is limited and we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P56_S3	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The markets in Alaska for voice, data and wireless communications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P59_S4	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Cyber attacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Cyber attacks or other breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of our operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm in recent years.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Although we have not been subject to cyber attacks or network disruptions which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of such events and protect our information technology and confidential customer data may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack or network disruption in the future.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Some of the most significant risks to our information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:
75679_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of our vendors and other providers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If hackers or cyber thieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, or modify confidential customer data.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Relatedly, a network disruption (including one resulting from a cyber attack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Due to the evolving techniques used in cyber attacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The costs imposed on us as a result of a cyber attack or network disruption could be significant.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to the public s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P65_S2	As a result, a cyber attack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Prolonged service interruptions could affect our business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P67_S5	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA facilities and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Our facilities also include TERRA and its extensions which are an unringed facility operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or of our unringed TERRA facility and its extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P77_S2	We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P77_S3	We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our significant debt and capital lease obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes, Amended Senior Credit Facility, other debt or capital leases.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and capital lease obligations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	On December 31, 2013, we had total debt of $1,048.0 million and total capital lease obligations of $74.6 million.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our high level of debt and capital lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends on GCI's common stock.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P85_S4	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P85_S5	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Amended Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Amended Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P88_S4	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Amended Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Amended Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P88_S5	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Any significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We had $504.8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2013, consisting of cable certificates of $191.6 million, goodwill of $219.0 million, wireless licenses of $91.4 million and broadcast licenses of $2.8 million.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Our broadcast licens es represent permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, and the fair value of the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P93_S3	The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P93_S4	These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	At December 31, 2013, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $294.5 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	If GCI experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when its market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P98_S5	However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Additionally, new government regulations on the use of a wireless device while driving may affect us through a reduction in usage revenue.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Studies have indicated that using wireless devices while driving may impair a driver s attention.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Many state and local legislative bodies, including Alaska s, have passed legislation to restrict the use of wireless telephones while driving vehicles.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P100_S2	In Alaska all drivers are banned from texting while driving.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Concerns over safety and the effect of additional future legislation, if adopted and enforced in the areas we serve, could limit our ability to market and sell our wireless services.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P100_S4	Litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries allegedly incurred as a result of wireless telephone use while driving could result in adverse publicity and further governmental regulation.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P100_S5	Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	A significant percentage of GCI's voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	As of December 31, 2013, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 12% of GCI's combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 23% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI's Board.
75679_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our Wireline and Wireless segments have properties that consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.
75679_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all of our properties are located on or in leased real property or facilities.
75679_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	Substantially all of our properties secure our Amended Senior Credit Facility.

75679_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	GCI's Class A and Class B common stock are publicly traded.
75679_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Dividends GCI and GCI, Inc. have never paid cash dividends on GCI's common stock, and we have no present intention of doing so.
75679_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be determined by GCI's Board of Directors in light of our earnings, financial condition and other relevant considerations.
75679_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	Our existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit payment of dividends on common stock, other than stock dividends (see note 6 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information).

75679_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The Selected Financial Data should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
75679_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables, unbilled revenues, accrual of the USF high cost Remote area program support, share-based compensation, inventory at lower of cost or market, reserve for future customer credits, liability for incurred but not reported medical insurance claims, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, depreciable and amortizable lives of assets, the carrying value of long-lived assets including goodwill, cable certificates, wireless licenses, and broadcast licenses, our effective tax rate, purchase price allocations, deferred lease expense, asset retirement obligations, the accrual of cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) ("Cost of Goods Sold"), depreciation, and accrual of contingencies and litigation.
75679_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
75679_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	See also our Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
75679_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska in 1997 to affect the issuance of Senior Notes.
75679_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	GCI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, received through its initial capitalization all ownership interests in subsidiaries previously held by GCI.

75679_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Shares of GCI s Class B common stock are traded on the Over-the-Counter market.
75679_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Shares of GCI, Inc. s common stock are wholly owned by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	The GCI and GCI, Inc. consolidated financial statements include substantially the same account activity.
75679_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	General Overview Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins.
75679_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	As discussed earlier in Item 1 Business Geographic Concentration and the Alaska Economy, our revenue is impacted by the strength of the Alaska economy.
75679_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Alaska economy is affected by certain economic factors including activity in the oil and gas industry, tourism, government spending, and military personnel stationed in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Additionally, the health of the national economy can impact our revenue.
75679_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Effective January 1, 2013, we refocused our business and now have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline.
75679_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Wireless segment s revenue is derived from wholesale wireless services.
75679_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Wireline segment s revenue includes all of our other revenue.
75679_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	This change reflects our plan to strategically focus on our wireless network and is how our chief operating decision maker now measures performance and makes resource allocation decisions.
75679_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Prior to 2013, we had operated our business under five reportable segments Consumer, Network Access, Commercial, Managed Broadband and Regulated Operations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	The historical segment data has been reclassified to conform to the revised reportable segments.
75679_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	On July 22, 2013, we closed the transactions under the Wireless Agreement and other related agreements entered into on June 4, 2012 by and among Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. ( ACS ), GCI, ACS Wireless, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACS, GCI Wireless Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, and AWN, pursuant to which the parties agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	This transaction provides a statewide network with the spectrum mix, scale, advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with Verizon Wireless and AT T Mobility in Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	AWN provides wholesale services to GCI and ACS.
75679_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	GCI and ACS use the AWN network in order to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers.
75679_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	GCI and ACS continue to compete against each other and other wireless providers in the retail market.
75679_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we contributed our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Additionally, ACS contributed its wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	As consideration for the contributed business assets and liabilities, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, a one-third ownership interest in AWN and entitlements to receive preferential cash distributions totaling $190.0 million over the Preference Period.
75679_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	ACS's preferential cash distributions are expected to be higher than that which they would receive from their one-third interest.
75679_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	We received a two-third ownership interest in AWN, as well as entitlements to receive all remaining cash distributions after ACS s preferential cash distributions during the Preference Period.
75679_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	The distributions to each member are subject to adjustment based on the number of ACS and GCI wireless subscribers, with the aggregate adjustment capped at $21.8 million for each member over the Preference Period.
75679_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Following the Preference Period, we and ACS will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests.
75679_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	As part of closing, we borrowed $100.0 million under our Amended Senior Credit Facility to fund the purchase of wireless network assets from ACS.
75679_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	As an ETC, we receive support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas.
75679_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published final rules to reform, among others, the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services ( High Cost Order ).
75679_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	The High Cost Order segregated the support methodology for Remote areas in Alaska from the support methodology for all urban areas, including Alaska Urban locations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Our future revenue recognition for both Remote and Urban high cost support is dependent upon the functionality and timing of an operational successor funding mechanism.
75679_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	At December 31, 2013, we believe an implementation of a successor funding mechanism prior to January 2015 is unlikely.
75679_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	In October 2013 and February 2014 two of our customers received notices of denial and funding changes from the Rural Health Care Division of USAC related to certain services we provided during 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	In 2013 one customer filed an appeal with the FCC and we expect the other customer to file an FCC appeal in 2014.
75679_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	We recognized $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, and because we believe our customers are in compliance with program rules, we expect our customers will prevail in their appeals we have not reduced our revenue recognition during the year ended December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	In November 2010, Verizon acquired a license for 22MHz of the 700 MHz wireless spectrum band covering Alaska.
75679_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	In June 2013, Verizon began providing service on its LTE network in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.
75679_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	The service provided by Verizon s LTE network is limited to data only.
75679_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (underlying data rounded to the nearest thousand):
75679_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on earnings before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation expense, accretion expense, income or loss attributable to non-controlling interest, and non-cash contribution adjustment ( Adjusted EBITDA ).
75679_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures.
75679_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	In addition, multiples of current or projected earnings before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense and income taxes ( EBITDA ) are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value.
75679_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Overview of Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold Total revenues increased 5% from $679.4 million in 2011 to $710.2 million in 2012 and increased 14% to $811.6 million in 2013 .
75679_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Revenue increased in both of our segments in 2013 and 2012.
75679_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Total Cost of Goods Sold increased 9% from $227.4 million in 2011 to $247.5 million in 2012 and increased 13% to $280.5 million in 2013 .
75679_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Cost of Goods Sold increased in both of our segments in 2013 and 2012.
75679_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Wireless Segment Overview Wireless segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, and Adjusted EBITDA for 2013 , 2012, and 2011 are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The increase in revenue in 2013 is primarily due to the following:
75679_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	A $6.2 million increase in non-Lifeline retail revenue in 2013 due to an increase in non-Lifeline retail customers.
75679_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	The increase is partially off-set by a $6.6 million increase in the wireless handset cash incentives to ACS in 2013 for the sale of wireless handsets to their retail customers due to the July 22, 2013 close of the AWN transaction.
75679_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold The increase in Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to the following:
75679_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	A $6.7 million increase in 2012 primarily due to wireless handset equipment costs.
75679_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Wireless segment provides a handset subsidy to the Wireline segment - Consumer and Wireline segment - Business Services to offset the cost of handsets sold to retail wireless subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Additional increases in network maintenance costs in 2013 due to the growth of the wireless network due to the July 22, 2013 close of the AWN transaction and increased emphasis on our wireless network.
75679_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The increase in 2013 is partially off-set by an $11.0 million decrease in wireless equipment costs.
75679_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Through the AWN transaction close the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	Subsequent to the transaction close and through December 31, 2013, although permitted, the Wireline segment was unable to meet the requirements in order to request a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agree ments.
75679_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	We expect the cost of wireless equipment sold to the Wireline segment's retail customers to be recorded in the Wireline segment in 2014.
75679_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2013 is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in Wireless Segment Revenues.
75679_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	This increase was partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our Wireline segment offers services and products under three major customer groups as follows:
75679_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Consumer we offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video and voice services to residential customers.

75679_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Universal Service Fund's Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at affordable rates.
75679_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	10 A non-Lifeline wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device that is not eligible for Lifeline support.
75679_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	11 Average monthly wireless revenues, excluding those from other wireless carrier customers, divided by the average of wireless subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in the period ("Wireless ARPU").
75679_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Revenue used for this calculation includes Wireline segment - Consumer - Wireless, Wireline segment - Business Services - Wireless and wholesale wireless revenues earned from GCI retail subscribers included in the Wireless segment for 2013, 2012, and 2011.
75679_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Consumer The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a $12.2 million or 16% and $11.6 million or 18% increase in cable modem revenue for 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to an increase in the average number of subscribers and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds and higher usage limits.
75679_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Additionally, data revenue increased $2.9 million or 57% in 2012 due to an increase in excess usage revenue.
75679_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The decrease in voice revenue in 2012 is primarily due to:
75679_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	A 21% decrease in local service plan fee revenue to $15.9 million due to decreased subscribers and a February 2012 rate decrease to one of our popular plans.
75679_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	A 39% decrease in long-distance usage to $2.4 million due to the lower rates mandated by the Intrastate Access Reform Act ("Intrastate Access Reform") which went into effect in July 2011, along with our introduction of a popular new plan offering unlimited interstate and intrastate calling which went into effect in August 2011.
75679_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Business Services Business Services data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.
75679_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The increase in data revenue in 2013 is primarily due to a $10.2 million or 20% in managed services project revenue due to special project work.
75679_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decrease in data revenue in 2012 is primarily due to a $4.5 million or 5% decrease due to rate compression that was partially offset by a $4.2 million or 9% increase in special project work.
75679_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	The increase in data revenue in 2013 and 2012 is primarily due to:
75679_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Recognition of $1.6 million in 2012 in previously denied funding from the USAC for one ConnectMD customer for the funding year July 2008 to June 2009.
75679_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	We had appealed the funding denial and received notice during the second quarter of 2012 that our appeal was successful and the funding was reinstated.
75679_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The increase in 2013 was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in product sales to our customers and the absence of $1.6 million in revenue recognized in 2012 for USAC funding that was reinstated as discussed above.
75679_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The individually significant items contributing to the 2013 and 2012 increases in Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold include:
75679_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	A 104% or $11.8 million increase in 2013 wireless Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to an increase in the number of handsets sold and a decrease in subsidies received from the Wireless segment for the purchase of wireless handsets.
75679_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Through the AWN transaction close the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	Subsequent to the transaction close and through December 31, 2013, although permitted, the Wireline segment was unable to meet the requirements in order to request a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agree ments.
75679_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increases are partially offset by the following individually significant items:
75679_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	A 9% or $3.1 million and 16% or $6.8 million decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold for 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to the continuing decrease in long distance and local service subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for 2012 is primarily due to an increase in revenues as described above in "Wireline Segment Revenues" partially offset by an increase in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireline Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $ 27.8 million to $271.1 million for 2013 and $7.7 million to $243 million for 2012.
75679_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Individually significant items contributing to the increases include:
75679_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 33% , 34% , and 35% of revenue for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $16.8 million to $147.3 million and $4.5 million to $130.5 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increases in 2013 and 2012 are primarily due to new assets placed in service in those years partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during those years.
75679_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Additionally, we recorded $8.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 for the assets acquired from ACS as part of the AWN transaction.
75679_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of other income, increased $2.4 million to $70.2 million in 2013 and decreased $9.9 million to $67.7 million in 2012.
75679_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The 2013 increase is primarily due to increased interest expense attributable to increased borrowing on our Amended Senior Credit Facility.
75679_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The 2012 decrease is primarily due the absence of a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in 2011.
75679_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income Tax Expense GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Income tax expense totaled $11.0 million, $12.1 million, and $7.4 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Our effective income tax rate was 26%, 57%, and 57% in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	Our effective income tax rate decreased in 2013 due to the inclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN in income before income tax expense.
75679_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	At December 31, 2013, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $294.5 million that will begin expiring in 2020 if not utilized, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.9 million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years.
75679_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $120.9 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2013 and that expire from 2020 to 2033, respectively, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2007, and that expire in 2024 through 2027, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 23% to 28% in the year ending December 31, 2014.
75679_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	On April 30, 2013, GCI Holdings, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement with Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as administrative agent ("Amended Senior Credit Facility").
75679_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Amended Senior Credit Facility provides up to $240.0 million in delayed draw term loans and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility.
75679_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	The Amended Senior Credit Facility replaced the Senior Credit Facility described in Note 6(c) of our December 31, 2012 annual report on Form 10-K. The interest rate under the Amended Senior Credit Facility is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin dependent upon our Total Leverage Ratio ranging from 2% to 3%.
75679_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	The Amended Senior Credit Facility will mature on April 30, 2018.
75679_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	The terms of the Amended Senior Credit Facility include customary representations and warranties, customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default.
75679_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	commitment to make further loans under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
75679_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The obligations under the Amended Senior Credit Facility are secured by a security interest on substantially all of the assets of GCI Holdings, Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors, and on the stock of GCI Holdings, Inc.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	As discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 2, on July 22, 2013, we closed the AWN transaction.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we contributed our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Additionally, ACS contributed its wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	As consideration for the contributed assets and liabilities, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, a one-third ownership percentage in AWN and entitlements to receive preferential cash distributions totaling $190.0 million over the Preference Period contingent on the future cash flows of AWN.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	The preferential cash distribution is cumulative and may be paid beyond the Preference Period until the entire $190.0 million is paid.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S5	We funded the purchase by borrowing $100.0 million under our Amended Senior Credit Facility on July 17, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P73_S6	We have also agreed to provide AWN a $50.0 million working capital line of credit.
75679_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	We will manage AWN and receive a management fee of 4% of free cash flow as defined in the Wireless Agreement in the first two years of operations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	The management fee will increase to 6% in the third and fourth years of the agreement and to 8% after the fourth year of the agreement.
75679_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	The management fee will be paid before distributions to the owners.
75679_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	On November 1, 2013, we closed the transactions under the asset purchase agreements, pursuant to which Denali Media Holdings, Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Denali Media Anchorage, Corp. and Denali Media Southeast, Corp., agreed to purchase three Alaska broadcast stations for a total of $7.6 million.
75679_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We have entered into several financing arrangements under the New Markets Tax Credit ( NMTC ) program which have provided a total of $32.3 million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network.
75679_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	When completed, the project, called TERRA-NW, will connect to our TERRA-Southwest network and provide a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the Internet.
75679_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	We began construction on TERRA-NW in 2012 and expect to complete all current phases of the project in 2014.
75679_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	We placed into service Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the TERRA-NW project on January 3, 2013 and November 5, 2013, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	The total net cash received under the NMTC program is recorded as restricted cash and included in Other Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
75679_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	We have used $29.3 million of restricted cash to fund cumulative TERRA-NW capital expenditures through December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	We plan to fund an additional $10.0 million to complete TERRA-NW.
75679_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	I auction for a $41.4 million grant to partially fund expansion of our 3G wireless network, or better, to locations in Alaska where we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	We must file a long-form application with the FCC by April 4, 2014, which must be reviewed for final approval, before the award can be issued.
75679_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Our net cash flows provided by and (used for) operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2013 and 2012, are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013 is due to an increase in net income that was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of receipt of payments.
75679_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures and $100.0 million to purchase wireless network assets from ACS as part of the close of the AWN transaction.
75679_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $180.6 million and $146.0 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Our capital expenditures increased in 2013 primarily due an increase in spending to expand our network.
75679_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	Depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2014, we expect our 2014 expenditures to total $170.0 million including core and non-core operations and excluding real estate acquisitions and an extension of satellite lease capacity.
75679_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 consists primarily of proceeds from borrowing $100.0 million under the term loan portion of our Amended Senior Credit Facility to fund the purchase of wireless network assets from ACS as part of the close of the AWN transaction and borrowings under the revolving portion of our Amended Senior Credit Facility.
75679_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	These proceeds were partially offset by repayments of Rural Utilities Service ("RUS") debt and repurchases of GCI's common stock.
75679_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_14_ITEM7_P86_S3	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI's common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our Amended Senior Credit Facility includes a $240.0 million term loan and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.
75679_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	We had $229.0 million outstanding under the term loan at December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	Under the revolving portion of the Amended Senior Credit Facility we have borrowed $32.0 million and have $4.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, which leaves $124.6 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P87_S3	A total of $261.0 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Debt Covenants We are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ), our $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.63% Senior Notes due 2019 ("2019 Notes), our Amended Senior Credit Facility, and our RUS loans.
75679_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Share Repurchases GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.

75679_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	on GCI's behalf, 1.8 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $15.6 million.
75679_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage, liquidity, company performance, and market conditions and subject to continued oversight by GCI s Board of Directors.
75679_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	The open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of SEC Rule 10b-18.

75679_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	We amended our transponder capacity lease agreement with Intelsat in October 2013 to lease additional transponder capacity on Intelsat's Galaxy 18 spacecraft.
75679_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	As a result, on January 1, 2014 we expect to increase our existing capital lease asset and liability by $9.4 million.
75679_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling $37.6 million which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2013.

75679_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	There were various updates recently issued which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries.
75679_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	None of the updates are expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
75679_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	Our financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI's Audit Committee.
75679_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2013 are described below.
75679_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	The accounting estimates related to revenues from the Remote high cost, rural health, and schools and libraries USF programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap, our assessment of the impact of new FCC regulations, the potential outcome of FCC proceedings and the potential outcome of USAC contract reviews.
75679_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods.
75679_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	Significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Receivables We maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	We also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from USAC for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals, health clinics and school districts.
75679_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	We base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, changes in our collections process, regulatory requirements, and our customers compliance with USAC rules .
75679_14_ITEM7_P104_S3	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
75679_14_ITEM7_P104_S4	If their financial condition improves, or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings, allowances may be reduced.
75679_14_ITEM7_P104_S5	Such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Impairment and Useful Lives of Intangible Assets We had $504.8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2013, consisting of cable certificates of $191.6 million, goodwill of $219.0 million, wireless licenses of $91.4 million, and broadcast licenses of $2.8 million.
75679_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	We are allowed to first assess qualitative factors ( Step Zero ) to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, however, we chose to assess goodwill for impairment using the traditional quantitative two-step process.
75679_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
75679_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics.
75679_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are the same as our two reportable segments.
75679_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
75679_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
75679_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	We are allowed to perform a Step Zero analysis for our annual test over our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill.
75679_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	However, we chose to test for impairment using the traditional quantitative approach.
75679_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
75679_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our cable certificates are our largest indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_14_ITEM7_P111_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is from cable system acquisitions.
75679_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	The cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics.
75679_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	We use comparable market transactions from recent FCC auctions, as appropriate, and a hypothetical build-up method to value our wireless licenses.
75679_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our broadcast licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to broadcast television stations within a certain geographical area.
75679_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of television stations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	We did not perform an impairment test on our broadcast licenses during 2013 since we acquired them in November 2013 when we acquired the television stations pursuant to the Media Agreement.
75679_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	We use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
75679_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	In addition, a market-based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach.
75679_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The direct discounted cash flow, hypothetical build-up, and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows, discount rate, customer churn, and customer behaviors and attrition.
75679_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge.
75679_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.
75679_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
75679_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
75679_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	Events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces, customer behaviors, change in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, performance compared to peers, material and ongoing negative economic trends, and specific industry or market sector conditions.
75679_14_ITEM7_P117_S4	We may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions, expected future operating results, or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill, cable certificates, and wireless licenses.
75679_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	We have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2013, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between 9% and 34%.
75679_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	The reporting unit that exceeded the book value by 9% passed the goodwill impairment test by $78.1 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	We believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
75679_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	Based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2013, the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by 43% and $82.9 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 25% and $22.6 million as of October 31, 2013, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $120.9 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2013, and that primarily expire from 2020 to 2033, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 to 2007, and that expire in 2024 to 2027, respectively.
75679_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	deferred tax assets of $1.9 million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire.
75679_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013, based on management s belief that future reversals of existing temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_14_ITEM7_P121_S3	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	I Item 1 Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	Inflation We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) in 1992.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	On July 22, 2013, we closed the transactions under the Wireless Agreement entered into on June 4, 2012, pursuant to which the parties agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	We have excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, AWN's internal control over financial reporting associated with net revenue of $13.8 million included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2013, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we implemented internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition from ACS's retail subscribers.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P7_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P7_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.

75679_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	General We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues.
75679_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	We offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, data services, Internet access, video services and voice services, to residential and business customers across the state under our GCI brand.
75679_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
75679_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Since GCI's founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets.
75679_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.
75679_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	In recent years, we expanded our efforts in wireless and presently operate the only statewide wireless network.
75679_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated consolidated revenues of $910.2 million .
75679_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	We ended the period with 149,600 wireless subscribers, 133,200 cable modem subscribers and 135,400 basic video subscribers.

75679_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	We funded the purchase with a $275.0 million Term B Loan under our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI.
75679_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	We intend to continue to increase revenues using the following strategies:
75679_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that bundling our services significantly improves customer retention, increases revenue per customer and reduces customer acquisition expenses.
75679_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our experience indicates that our bundled customers are significantly less likely to churn, and we experience less price erosion when we effectively combine our offerings.
75679_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Bundling improves our top line revenue growth, provides operating cost efficiencies that expand our margins and drives our overall business performance.
75679_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	We sell new and enhanced services and products to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.
75679_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
75679_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have positioned ourselves as a customer service leader in the Alaska communications market.
75679_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	We operate our own customer service department and have empowered our customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call.
75679_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	We prioritize our customer services to expedite handling of our most valuable customers issues, particularly for our largest commercial customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	We believe our integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows us to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
75679_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	We continue to expand and evolve our integrated network for the delivery of our services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving our customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization.
75679_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	and increase returns on our invested capital.
75679_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	We periodically evaluate our network assets and continually monitor technological developments that we can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
75679_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Expand Our Product Portfolio and Footprint in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Throughout our history, we have successfully added and expect to continue to add new products to our product portfolio.
75679_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	We have a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for our customers, and we continue to assess revenue-enhancing opportunities that create value for our customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of our network coverage, we are currently pursuing or expect to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of our facilities, enhance our ability to serve our existing customers needs and attract new customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	Additionally, due to the unique market conditions in Alaska, we, and in some cases our customers, participate in several federal (and to a lesser extent locally) subsidized programs designed to financially support the implementation and purchase of telecommunications services like ours in high cost areas.
75679_15_ITEM1_P17_S5	With these programs we have been able to expand our network into previously undeveloped areas of Alaska and, for the first time, offer comprehensive communications services in many rural parts of the state where we would not otherwise be able to construct within appropriate return-on-investment requirements.
75679_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions of in-state telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our management team will continue to actively pursue and make investments that we believe fit with our strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.

75679_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	We compete in the wholesale wireless market by offering competitive rates and by providing a comprehensive statewide network to meet the needs of carrier customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Seasonality Wireless segment revenues derived from our carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction, commercial fishing, and oil and gas activities.
75679_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow, and short daylight hours.

75679_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our management platform constantly monitors this port and continual communications are maintained with all of the core and distribution elements in the network.
75679_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.
75679_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	The management platform has the capability to remotely access routers, servers and layer two switches, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service point.
75679_15_ITEM1_P40_S4	This management platform allows us to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
75679_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Competition We operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment and information products and services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior.
75679_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition We compete with AT T, Verizon, and other community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	The national wireless carriers with whom we compete, AT T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than ours.
75679_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.
75679_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, bundled services, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, statewide network coverage and capacity, TurboZone, the type of wireless handsets offered, and the availability of differentiated features and services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Competition is based upon price and pricing plans, service bundles, the types of services offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	We compete with other Alaska based Internet providers and domestic, non-Alaska based providers that provide national service coverage.
75679_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Several of the providers headquartered outside of Alaska have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Niche providers in the industry, both local and national, compete with certain of our Internet service products, such as web hosting, list services, and e-mail.
75679_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
75679_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems.
75679_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone.
75679_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
75679_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our video systems face competition from services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, as well as alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals, including DBS, digital video over telephone lines, broadband IP-based services, wireless and satellite master antenna television systems.
75679_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems.
75679_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Online video services via the Internet are a major growing source of competition for our video services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Additionally, some online video services are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content.
75679_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	We believe that the greatest source of external competition for our video services comes from the DBS industry.
75679_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	Two major companies, DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering high-power DBS services in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Competitive forces will be counteracted by offering expanded programming through digital services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Digital delivery technology is being utilized in all of our systems.
75679_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	We have retransmission agreements with various broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into certain of our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Additionally, our acquisition of television stations provides us the opportunity to create unique content for our subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.
75679_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
75679_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Voice Services and Products Competition Our most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	We also compete against Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"), long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance.
75679_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	We have competed by offering what we believe is excellent customer service, cross product discounts, and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Seasonality Our Wireline segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Major Customer We had no Wireline segment major customers in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
75679_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Sales and Marketing Company-wide Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, Internet and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Environmental Regulations We undertake activities that may, under certain circumstances, affect the environment.
75679_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	Accordingly, they may be subject to federal, state, and local laws designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
75679_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
75679_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon.
75679_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Some facilities may be on wetlands that may be subject to state and/or federal regulation.
75679_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	We obtain federal, state, and local permits, as required, for our projects and operations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	We are unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
75679_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses We do not hold patents, franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	We hold a number of federally registered service marks used by our reportable segments.
75679_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	We hold licenses for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Wireline segment.
75679_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	We hold various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use.
75679_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	These licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	However, we expect these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
75679_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	We hold licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years.
75679_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area.
75679_15_ITEM1_P72_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Regulation Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_15_ITEM1_P73_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	Wireless Services and Products General .
75679_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	As wireless licensees, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
75679_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, modification, and registration of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas on towers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	The High Cost Program of the Universal Service Fund ("USF") pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, and the Matanuska Telephone Association, Inc. ("MTA") study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P77_S3	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	On November 29, 2011, the FCC released rules reforming the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	capped as of January 1, 2012, and a five-step phase-down commenced on July 1, 2012, which is currently frozen pending the adoption of a successor mechanism.
75679_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	Support to Remote Alaska locations was capped as of January 1, 2012 and is being distributed on a per-line basis until the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_15_ITEM1_P79_S2	A further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_15_ITEM1_P79_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	The order adopted several reforms, including a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	Failure to correctly recertify Lifeline subscribers could materially adversely affect our Lifeline revenues and/or increase our costs in the form of FCC fines for failure to comply with Lifeline rules.
75679_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have completed negotiations and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks for more information.
75679_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s phone number and approximate location.
75679_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Due to Alaska s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.
75679_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC s standard.
75679_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	We have filed for a separate waiver, also pending, regarding the FCC s recently adopted text-to-911 rules due to technical limitations in our network and the inability of vendors to provide a workable solution; we expect to develop a text-to-911 technical solution during the first half of 2015.
75679_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_15_ITEM1_P88_S4	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P88_S5	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to customers and result in higher costs to customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	Internet-based Services and Products General .
75679_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the Internet.
75679_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_15_ITEM1_P92_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_15_ITEM1_P92_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	The vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect our costs and the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	On November 20, 2011, the FCC issued rules governing the activities of cable operators and other Internet service providers in connection with the provision of Internet service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	The rules applicable to cable operators and other wireline providers generally prohibited blocking lawful content and prohibiting unreasonable discrimination, outside of reasonable network management, as well as imposing transparency requirements.
75679_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	For wireless providers, the transparency rule and a less restrictive version of the blocking rule applied.
75679_15_ITEM1_P95_S3	On January 14, 2014, in a case challenging these rules, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules, upheld the transparency rules, and remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.
75679_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	The majority opinion held that the FCC possessed the general statutory authority to adopt these rules, but did so in a manner that violated specific statutory prohibitions against imposing common carrier regulations on non-telecommunications services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	This order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S2	The order also strengthens its transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S3	The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S4	These rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S5	The order refrains from applying rate regulation and tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P97_S6	While we do not believe that the FCC order conflicts with our existing practices or offerings, the order will impose regulatory burdens, likely increase our costs, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	The RCA is also certified under federal law to regulate rates for the basic service tier on our video systems.
75679_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	Under state law, however, video service is exempt from regulation unless subscribers petition the RCA.
75679_15_ITEM1_P100_S2	At present, regulation of basic video rates takes place only in Juneau.
75679_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	The FCC mandated, effective July 1, 2007, that all new set-top video navigation devices must segregate the security function from the navigation function.
75679_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	The new devices are more expensive than existing equipment, and compliance would increase our cost of providing video services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	In late 2014, the President signed into law the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 ( STELAR ), which repeals the navigation device integrated security ban effective December 30, 2015.
75679_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	On April 21, 2010, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry to consider ways to develop a standardized interface for accessing video content, as an alternative to set-top boxes.
75679_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	Adoption of new rules or standards in this area could affect the manner in which we deliver video products to our customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	Pursuant to STELAR, the FCC has convened a Downloadable Security Technical Advisory Committee ( DSTAC ) to consider and recommend performance objectives, technical capabilities and technical standards to promote competitive availability of navigation devices.
75679_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	The DSTAC report is due by September 30, 2015.
75679_15_ITEM1_P108_S2	We are unable to predict if the FCC will act on the report to propose concrete rules at that time.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S5	In addition, on April 7, 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P109_S6	The United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, upheld the FCC s rules, denying challenges from several utility companies.
75679_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Though the general purpose of the rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.
75679_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	In addition, because the RCA has adopted its own formula, the FCC s reclassification of broadband service as a telecommunications service is not anticipated to have any near-term impact.
75679_15_ITEM1_P110_S2	We cannot predict the likelihood of the RCA changing its formula, adopting the federal formula, or relinquishing its oversight of pole attachments to the FCC, any of which could increase the cost of our operations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_15_ITEM1_P111_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_15_ITEM1_P111_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_15_ITEM1_P111_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.
75679_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	Wireline Voice Services and Products General.
75679_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P114_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the RCA and the FCC as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P114_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_15_ITEM1_P115_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the MTA study area (which includes the Matanuska-Susitna Valley), and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P115_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_15_ITEM1_P115_S3	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service for information on USF reform.
75679_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	We participated in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs, including ACS (for its Fairbanks and Juneau operating companies), MTA and Ketchikan Public Utilities, in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_15_ITEM1_P117_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_15_ITEM1_P118_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Consumer Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_15_ITEM1_P120_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_15_ITEM1_P121_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_15_ITEM1_P121_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC released rules to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_15_ITEM1_P121_S2	We do not anticipate that the adopted changes, for which implementation began in 2012, will have a material impact on our operations, except that the reduction of interstate access rates generally will result in a cost savings on access charges to us.
75679_15_ITEM1_P121_S3	However, the details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and they could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_15_ITEM1_P121_S4	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_15_ITEM1_P122_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be changed in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rule modifications that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_15_ITEM1_P122_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_15_ITEM1_P122_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_15_ITEM1_P123_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_15_ITEM1_P123_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	The Communications Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_15_ITEM1_P125_S0	Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks.
75679_15_ITEM1_P125_S1	On January 30, 2014, the FCC adopted an order calling for experiments to examine how best to accelerate the technological and regulatory transitions from traditional TDM-based networks to IP-based technologies.
75679_15_ITEM1_P125_S2	Although no entity has proposed conducting a technology transition experiment in our service territory in response to the FCC s January 2014 order, additional proposals for experiments are possible.
75679_15_ITEM1_P125_S3	We cannot predict whether additional proposals for experiments might be submitted to the FCC nor any resulting proceedings or their effect on us.
75679_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	The FCC also has other open dockets through which it might make changes to the regulatory regime applicable to IP-based networks.
75679_15_ITEM1_P126_S1	A change in regulatory obligation or classification that interferes with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
75679_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	On December 12, 2012, the FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund to supplement the existing Rural Health Care Program of the USF.
75679_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	existing Rural Health Care Program or the new Healthcare Connect Fund.
75679_15_ITEM1_P128_S1	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this change but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our operations.
75679_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	On July 11 and December 11, 2014, the FCC adopted orders modernizing the USF Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate").
75679_15_ITEM1_P129_S1	These orders, among other things, increased the annual E-Rate cap by approximately $1.5 billion, designated funds for internal connections within schools and libraries, and eliminated funding for certain legacy services, such as voice, to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide.
75679_15_ITEM1_P129_S2	We cannot at this time predict the effect of these orders on the overall E-Rate support available to our schools and libraries customers, but the elimination of funding of certain services, including video conferencing services, could materially affect our revenue from such customers.
75679_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	We do not have significant foreign operations or export sales.
75679_15_ITEM1_P130_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	Company-Sponsored Research We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	We offer wireless, data and voice telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries, and in particular oil production, as well as government spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_15_ITEM1_P133_S1	A long-term decrease in oil prices may impact spending by the oil and gas industry and the government, which could negatively impact our revenue.
75679_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	The government spending is comprised of state government and United States military spending.
75679_15_ITEM1_P134_S1	Any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us.
75679_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	Employees We employed 2,255 persons as of December 31, 2014, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_15_ITEM1_P135_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_15_ITEM1_P135_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	Other No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We face increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Item 1 Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers perceptions of our services, and customer care quality.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Managing these factors and subscribers expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	AT T Wireless and Verizon have national networks which enable them to offer automatic roaming services to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We believe that the rates charged to us by some of these carriers may be higher than the rates they charge to certain other roaming partners.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The FCC has adopted rules requiring commercial mobile radio service providers to provide automatic roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The FCC has also adopted rules generally requiring carriers to offer data roaming services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to successfully manage the integration of the wireless subscribers acquired from ACS in the Wireless Acquisition or we may be unable to realize the anticipated synergies.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	On February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition which included the acquisition of wireless subscribers from ACS.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively integrate the new wireless subscribers or recognize the expected synergies.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	from management and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of our other businesses.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additionally, completion of the subscriber acquisition could disrupt current plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Integration difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may be unable to realize the anticipated cost savings from the Wireless Acquisition or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Significant costs have been incurred and are expected to be incurred in connection with the Wireless Acquisition, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	On February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are implementing a series of cost savings initiatives that we expect to result in recurring, annual cost savings.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	There can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated cost savings from the Wireless Acquisition in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated time frames or cost expectations or at all.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	These or any other cost savings that we realize may differ materially from our estimates.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We cannot provide assurances that these anticipated savings will be achieved or that our programs and improvements will be completed as anticipated or at all.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in other expenses.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We expect to incur significant one-time, non-recurring costs to achieve the anticipated synergies in connection with the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, we expect to incur significant transaction fees and other costs related to the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred as we integrate our new wireless subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Failure to realize the expected costs savings and operating synergies and recognition of non-recurring costs related to the Wireless Acquisition could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Although the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	While we believe that we are currently in compliance with such FCC rules, the failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The FCC requires local notice in any community in which it is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	This rule change could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The order also strengthens its transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P27_S4	The new rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The order refrains from imposing rate regulation or tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply its new rules.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, although the FCC forbore from many of the provisions of Title II, we cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply the statutory provisions and regulations from which it did not forbear.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	It is possible that the FCC could interpret or apply its new rules or Title II statutory provisions or regulations in a way that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	There also is a risk class action lawsuits arising under the provisions of Title II from which the FCC did not forbear could have similar negative impacts.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Proposals have been made before Congress to mandate Open Internet regulation that could supplement or supplant in whole or part the FCC s new rules.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We currently cannot predict whether any such legislation will be adopted nor what impacts are most likely.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Currently, pursuant to Alaska law, the basic video rates in Juneau are the only rates in Alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority; the basic rates in Juneau were reviewed and approved by the RCA in July 2010.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact on the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to unbundled network elements.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This support was 19% , 18% , and 18% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We had USF net receivables of $109.6 million and $124.3 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireless Services and Products Universal Service and Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, as we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The decline in our Wireline segment voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We expect our Wireline voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenues will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") program for funding our TERRA-NW project.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In 2011 and 2012 we entered into three separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA-NW project.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which were restricted for use on TERRA-NW.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $56.0 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in December 2019.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Failure to complete development, testing and deployment of a new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	While it is often difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We offer wireless and wireline telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries, and in particular oil exploration, development, and production, as well as government spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The government spending is comprised of state government and United States military spending.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Any deterioration in these markets, such as a long-term decrease in oil prices, or the occurrence of a single disruptive event, such as a shut-down of the TransAlaska Pipeline System, could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Additionally, the customer base in Alaska is limited and we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that our technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyber-attacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Additionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Cyber-attacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Cyber-attacks on our technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of our operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Cyber-attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	It is possible for such cyber-attacks to go undetected for a long period of time, increasing the potential harm to our subscribers, our assets, and our reputation.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	To date, we have not been subject to cyber-attacks or network disruptions that individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Nevertheless, we engage in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to us, in order to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and safeguard our infrastructure and confidential customer information.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat detection, URL filtering, and encryption.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Despite these preventive actions, our efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack or network disruption in the future.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Some of the most significant risks to our information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:
75679_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of our vendors and other providers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, or modify confidential customer data.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Relatedly, a network disruption (including one resulting from a cyber-attack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Due to the evolving techniques used in cyber-attacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The costs imposed on us as a result of a cyber-attack or network disruption could be significant.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to the public s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	As a result, a cyber-attack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Prolonged service interruptions or system failures could affect our business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We are able to deliver services and serve our customers only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Disruption to our billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA facilities and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Our facilities also include TERRA and its extensions which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or of our unringed TERRA facility and its extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P85_S2	We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P85_S3	We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Our significant debt and capital lease obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, other debt or capital leases.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and capital lease obligations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	On December 31, 2014, we had total debt of $1,036.7 million and total capital lease obligations of $76.5 million.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Additionally, on February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition which was funded with a $275.0 million Term B Loan under our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Our high level of debt and capital lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P93_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P93_S4	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P93_S5	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P96_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P96_S4	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P96_S5	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace one or both.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	When out Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow could decrease.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P101_S1	If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Any significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We had $510.6 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2014, consisting of goodwill of $229.6 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $86.3 million and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Our broadcast licenses represent permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P106_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, and the fair value of the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P106_S3	The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	At December 31, 2014, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $320.3 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P109_S1	If GCI experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when its market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P109_S2	This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P111_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P111_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P111_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P111_S5	However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	A significant percentage of GCI's voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2014, GCI's executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 13% of its combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 23% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P113_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI's Board.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We invest in early-stage, venture backed companies.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The companies in which we invest are entrants to markets with new products or services.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P115_S1	These companies generally have revenue that does not cover the companies operating and capital expenditures.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P115_S2	As a result, the companies typically operate with monthly net losses and may require additional funding for operating and capital.
75679_15_ITEM1A_P115_S3	Given that, among other things, these companies are at an early stage in their life cycle and are often proving their business model, these companies may fail, go bankrupt, and lose all or substantially all of their value which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease most of our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our Wireline and Wireless segments have properties that consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.

75679_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The Selected Financial Data should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
75679_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables, unbilled revenues, accrual of the USF high cost Remote area program support, share-based compensation, inventory at lower of cost or market, reserve for future customer credits, liability for incurred but not reported medical insurance claims, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, depreciable and amortizable lives of assets, the carrying value of long-lived assets including goodwill, cable certificates, wireless licenses, and broadcast licenses, our effective tax rate, purchase price allocations, deferred lease expense, asset retirement obligations, the accrual of cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) ("Cost of Goods Sold"), depreciation, and accrual of contingencies and litigation.
75679_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
75679_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	See also our Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska in 1997 to affect the issuance of Senior Notes.
75679_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	GCI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, received through its initial capitalization all ownership interests in subsidiaries previously held by GCI.
75679_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Shares of GCI s Class A common stock are traded on the Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol of GNCMA.

75679_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The GCI and GCI, Inc. consolidated financial statements include substantially the same account activity.
75679_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	General Overview Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins.
75679_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	As discussed earlier in Item 1 Business Geographic Concentration and the Alaska Economy, our revenue is impacted by the strength of the Alaska economy.
75679_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Alaska economy is affected by certain economic factors including activity in the oil and gas industry, tourism, government spending, and military personnel stationed in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	A long-term decrease in oil prices may impact spending by the oil and gas industry and the government, which could negatively impact our revenue.
75679_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	Additionally, the health of the national economy can impact our revenue.
75679_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	On July 22, 2013, we closed the transactions under the Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement ("Wireless Agreement") and other related agreements entered into on June 4, 2012 by and among ACS, GCI, ACS Wireless, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACS, GCI Wireless Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, and AWN, pursuant to which the parties agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	This transaction provided a statewide network with the spectrum mix, scale, advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with Verizon Wireless and AT T Mobility in Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Until the closing of the Wireless Acquisition described below, AWN provided wholesale services to GCI and ACS, and GCI and ACS used the AWN network to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers.
75679_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we contributed our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Additionally, ACS contributed its wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	As consideration for the contributed business assets and liabilities, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, a one-third ownership interest in AWN, and preferential cash distributions totaling $50.0 million and $22.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	As part of closing, we borrowed $100.0 million under our Senior Credit Facility to fund the purchase of wireless network assets from ACS.
75679_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	On February 2, 2015, we completed the transaction to purchase ACS' wireless subscriber base and its one-third ownership interest in AWN for $293.2 million, subject to possible post-closing adjustments ("Wireless Acquisition").
75679_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Following the close of the Wireless Acquisition, AWN is a wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	We funded the purchase with a $275.0 million Term B loan under our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI.
75679_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	We expect to record costs of approximately $30.0 million in 2015 for one-time customary transaction costs and costs to migrate a billing system, train our customer service representatives, and to transition a portion of our new customers to our GSM network.
75679_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	ACS reported approximately 109,000 wireless subscribers as of September 30, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The actual number of wireless subscribers in good standing that we acquired on February 2, 2015 was approximately 87,000 due to a numbers of factors including subsequent subscriber losses, differences in methods of counting subscribers, and the exclusion of internal subscribers from the transaction.
75679_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	These numbers are preliminary and will be finalized during the first quarter of 2015.
75679_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	We expect the impact of the lower number of subscribers to be minimal as these subscribers had a low average revenue per user, reduced future phone subsidies, and an estimated $4.4 million reduction to the purchase price related to the subscriber attrition.
75679_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	As an ETC, we receive support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas.
75679_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC published final rules to reform, among others, the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services ( High Cost Order ).
75679_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The High Cost Order segregated the support methodology for Remote areas in Alaska from the support methodology for all urban areas, including Alaska Urban locations.
75679_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	dependent upon the functionality and timing of an operational successor funding mechanism.
75679_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Rulemaking is underway to consider a successor funding mechanism.
75679_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on Remote high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (underlying data rounded to the nearest thousand):
75679_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on earnings before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation expense, accretion expense, income or loss attributable to non-controlling interest, non-cash contribution adjustment, and other non-cash adjustments ( Adjusted EBITDA ).
75679_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures.
75679_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	In addition, multiples of current or projected earnings before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense and income taxes ( EBITDA ) are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value.
75679_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Overview of Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold Total revenues increased 14% from $710.2 million in 2012 to $811.6 million in 2013 and increased 12% to $910.2 million in 2014 .
75679_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Revenue increased in both of our segments in 2014 and 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Total Cost of Goods Sold increased 13% from $247.5 million in 2012 to $280.5 million in 2013 and increased 8% to $302.7 million in 2014 .
75679_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Cost of Goods Sold decreased in our Wireline segment and increased in our Wireless segment for 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Cost of Goods Sold increased in both of our segments in 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Wireless Segment Overview Wireless segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	See note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income before income taxes.
75679_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The increase in revenue is primarily due to the following:
75679_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase is partially off-set by a $2.5 million and $6.6 million increase in the wireless handset cash incentives to ACS in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for the sale of wireless handsets to their retail customers due to the July 22, 2013 close of the initial AWN transaction.
75679_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold The increase in Cost of Goods Sold is primarily due to the following:
75679_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	A $5.1 million increase in wireless equipment costs in 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	During the period from April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Additional increases in network maintenance costs in 2014 and 2013 due to the growth of the wireless network due to the July 22, 2013 close of the initial AWN transaction and increased emphasis on our wireless network.
75679_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The increase in 2013 is partially off-set by an $11.0 million decrease in wireless equipment costs.
75679_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Through the initial AWN transaction close the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	Subsequent to the transaction close and through March 31, 2014, although permitted, the Wireline segment was unable to meet the requirements in order to request a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agreements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The increases in Adjusted EBITDA in 2014 and 2013 are primarily due to increased revenue as described above in Wireless Segment Revenues.
75679_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	This increases were partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our Wireline segment offers services and products under three major customer groups as follows:
75679_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Consumer we offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video and voice services to residential customers.
75679_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Business Services - we offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video and voice services to businesses, governmental entities, educational institutions and wholesale data and voice services to common carrier customers.
75679_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Managed Broadband we offer Internet, data network and managed services to rural schools and health organizations and regulated voice services to residential and commercial customers in rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The components of Wireline segment revenue are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows (amounts in thousands):

75679_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The sum of all primary digital video, high-speed data, and telephony customers, not counting additional outlets.
75679_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	9 A Lifeline wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device that is eligible for Lifeline support.
75679_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Universal Service Fund's Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at affordable rates.
75679_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	10 A non-Lifeline wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device that is not eligible for Lifeline support.
75679_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	11 Average monthly wireless revenues, excluding those from other wireless carrier customers, divided by the average of wireless subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in the period ("Wireless ARPU").
75679_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Revenue used for this calculation includes Wireline segment - Consumer - Wireless, Wireline segment - Business Services - Wireless and wholesale wireless revenues earned from GCI retail subscribers included in the Wireless segment for 2014, 2013, and 2012.
75679_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	12 Applicable average monthly cable modem revenues divided by the average number of subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2014, 2013, and 2012.
75679_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Consumer The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a $12.1 million or 14% and $12.2 million or 16% increase in cable modem revenue for 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to an increase in the average number of subscribers in 2014 and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds and higher usage limits in 2014 and 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Business Services Business Services data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.
75679_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	The decrease in data revenue in 2014 is primarily due to a $14.1 million or 24% decrease in managed services project revenue due to a decrease in special project work.
75679_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The decrease in 2014 is partially offset by a $4.6 million or 5% increase in data transport and storage revenue due to increased demand for increased capacity and data speeds.
75679_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	The increase in data revenue in 2013 is primarily due to a $10.2 million or 20% in managed services project revenue due to special project work.
75679_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	The $18.1 million or 119% increase in video revenue in 2014 primarily results from an increase in advertising sales due to the election cycle and our acquisition of the television broadcast stations in the fourth quarter of 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in data revenue in 2014 and 2013 is primarily due to a $10.2 million or 11% and $12.3 million or 15% increase in monthly contract revenue in 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to new ConnectMD and SchoolAccess customers and increased data network capacity purchased by our existing ConnectMD and SchoolAccess customers due to increased demand.
75679_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	The individually significant items contributing to the 2014 and 2013 increases in Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold include:
75679_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	A 11% or $2.7 million and 102% or $12.5 million increase in 2014 and 2013 wireless device Cost of Goods Sold, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the number of handsets sold and in 2013 a decrease in subsidies received from the Wireless segment for the purchase of wireless handsets.
75679_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in 2014 was partially off-set by an increase in the subsidy.
75679_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Through the initial AWN transaction close the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	Subsequent to the transaction close and through March 31, 2014, although permitted, the Wireline segment was unable to meet the requirements in order to request a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agreements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	The increases are partially offset by the following individually significant items:
75679_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	A 9% or $3.1 million decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold for 2013 due to the continuing decrease in long distance and local service subscribers.
75679_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for 2014 is primarily due to an increase in revenues as described above in "Wireline Segment Revenues" partially offset by an increase in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireline Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.6 million to $293.6 million for 2014 and $27.8 million to $271.1 million for 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Individually significant items contributing to the increases include:
75679_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 32% , 33% , and 34% of revenue for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $23.0 million to $170.3 million and $16.8 million to $147.3 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increases in 2014 and 2013 are primarily due to new assets placed in service in those years partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during those years.
75679_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Additionally, we recorded an increase of $8.7 million and $8.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for the assets acquired from ACS as part of the AWN transaction.
75679_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of other income, increased $4.1 million to $74.3 million in 2014 and $2.4 million to $70.2 million in 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increases in 2014 and 2013 are primarily due to increased interest expense attributable to increased borrowing on our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Income Tax Expense GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Income tax expense totaled $10.0 million , $11.0 million , and $12.1 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our effective income tax rate was 14% , 26% , and 57% in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	Our effective income tax rate decreased in 2014 and 2013 due to the inclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN in income before income tax expense as of the transaction close in July 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	At December 31, 2014, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $320.3 million that will begin expiring in 2020 if not utilized, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.7 million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years.
75679_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $132.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2014 and that expire from 2020 to 2034, respectively, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2007, 2013, and 2014 and that expire in 2024 through 2027, 2033, and 2034, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 43% to 48% in the year ending December 31, 2015.
75679_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	The effective rate is expected to increase due to the completion on February 2, 2015, of the transaction to purchase ACS' one-third ownership interest in AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	Our effective income tax rate was lower in 2014 due to the inclusion of income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in AWN in income before income tax expense and the exclusion of income taxes on income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	As discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 2, on July 22, 2013, we closed the initial AWN transaction.
75679_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we contributed our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Additionally, ACS contributed its wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	As consideration for the contributed assets and liabilities, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, Inc., a one-third ownership percentage in AWN, and $50.0 million and $22.0 million in cash distributions in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P64_S4	We funded the purchase by borrowing $100.0 million under our Senior Credit Facility on July 17, 2013.
75679_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	On February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition to purchase ACS' wireless subscriber base and its one-third ownership interest in AWN for $293.2 million, subject to possible post-closing adjustments.
75679_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Following the close of the transaction, AWN is our wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	To fund the 2015 purchase from ACS, on February 2, 2015 GCI Holdings, Inc. entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement with Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as administrative agent, that included $275.0 million of a Term B Loan.
75679_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The interest rate under the Term B Loan is LIBOR plus 3.75%, with a 1% LIBOR floor.
75679_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Term B Loan will mature on February 2, 2022 or December 3, 2020 if our Senior Notes due 2021 are not refinanced prior to such date.
75679_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	I auction for a $41.4 million grant to partially fund expansion of our 3G wireless network, or better, to locations in Alaska where we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return-on-investment requirements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	We filed a long-form application with the FCC by their deadline and this form was approved in October 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	We expect to receive one-third of the grant funds in the first half of 2015 and between $6.0 and $16.0 million in additional grant fund disbursements in 2015, depending on upgrades completed and test results submitted to and approved by the FCC.
75679_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	We have entered into several financing arrangements under the NMTC program which have provided a total of $32.3 million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural Northwestern Alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network.
75679_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The project, called TERRA-NW, connects to our TERRA-Southwest network and provides a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the Internet.
75679_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	We began construction on TERRA-NW in 2012 and all phases of construction were complete as of December 31, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	We have used the entire $32.3 million of NMTC Restricted Cash to fund TERRA-NW capital expenditures.
75679_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our net cash flows provided by and (used for) operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2014 and 2013, are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 is due to an increase in net income and a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of receipt of payments.
75679_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures and in 2013 $100.0 million to purchase wireless network assets from ACS as part of the close of the 2013 AWN transaction.
75679_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $176.1 million and $180.6 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Our cash capital expenditures decreased in 2014 primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors.
75679_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2015, we expect our 2015 core capital expenditures to total approximately $170.0 million.
75679_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities in 2014 consists primarily of payments to ACS for preferential cash distributions, repayment of Rural Utilities Service debt, and repurchases of GCI's common stock.
75679_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	Our borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI's common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our Senior Credit Facility includes a $240.0 million term loan and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.
75679_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	We had $240.0 million outstanding under the term loan at December 31, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	Under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility we have borrowed $39.0 million and have $22.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, which leaves $88.5 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	A total of $279.0 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Debt Covenants We are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ), our $425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.63% Senior Notes due 2019 ("2019 Notes"), Senior Credit Facility, and Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Share Repurchases GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.
75679_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Under this program, GCI is currently authorized to make up to $122.2 million of repurchases as of December 31, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	During 2014 we repurchased, on GCI's behalf, 0.4 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $4.2 million.
75679_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10b-18.
75679_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (amounts in thousands):
75679_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our 2019 and 2021 Notes, Senior Credit Facility including the Term B Loan that was signed on February 2, 2015, and the Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Interest on the amount outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility is based on variable rates.
75679_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	We used the current rate paid on our Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments except that we used 4.75% to estimate our future interest payments on the Term B Loan.
75679_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Our 2019 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $18.3 million through November 2019 and our 2021 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.0 million through June 2021.
75679_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	For a discussion of our 2019 and 2021 Notes, and Senior Credit Facility see note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see note 13 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	We amended our transponder capacity lease agreement with Intelsat in October 2013 to lease additional transponder capacity on Intelsat's Galaxy 18 spacecraft and, as a result, on January 1, 2014 we increased our existing capital lease asset and liability by $9.4 million.
75679_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling $51.6 million which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2014.
75679_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose and off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09.
75679_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	This new standard provides guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually all of the current revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
75679_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
75679_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
75679_15_ITEM7_P88_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard on our financial position and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI's Audit Committee.
75679_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2014 are described below.
75679_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	The accounting estimates related to revenues from the Remote high cost, rural health, and schools and libraries USF programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap, our assessment of the impact of new FCC regulations, the potential outcome of FCC proceedings and the potential outcome of USAC contract reviews.
75679_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	Some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods.
75679_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	Significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Receivables We maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	We also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from USAC for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals, health clinics and school districts.
75679_15_ITEM7_P95_S2	We base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, changes in our collections process, regulatory requirements, and our customers compliance with USAC rules .
75679_15_ITEM7_P95_S3	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
75679_15_ITEM7_P95_S4	If their financial condition improves, or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings, allowances may be reduced.
75679_15_ITEM7_P95_S5	Such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	Impairment and Useful Lives of Intangible Assets We had $510.6 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2014, consisting of goodwill of $229.6 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $86.3 million, and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	We are allowed to first assess qualitative factors ( Step Zero ) to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, however, we chose to assess goodwill for impairment using the traditional quantitative two-step process.
75679_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
75679_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics.
75679_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are the same as our two reportable segments.
75679_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
75679_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_15_ITEM7_P99_S2	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
75679_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	We are allowed to perform a Step Zero analysis for our annual test over our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill.
75679_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	However, we chose to test for impairment using the traditional quantitative approach.
75679_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
75679_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	We use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
75679_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	In addition, a market-based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach.
75679_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_15_ITEM7_P103_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is from cable system acquisitions.
75679_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	The cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics.
75679_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	We use comparable market transactions from recent FCC auctions, as appropriate, and a hypothetical build-up method to value our wireless licenses.
75679_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Our broadcast licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to broadcast television stations within a certain geographical area.
75679_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	We used a hypothetical build-up method to value our broadcast licenses.
75679_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	The direct discounted cash flow, hypothetical build-up, and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows, discount rate, customer churn, and customer behaviors and attrition.
75679_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge.
75679_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.
75679_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
75679_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
75679_15_ITEM7_P108_S3	Events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces, customer behaviors, change in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, performance compared to peers, material and ongoing negative economic trends, and specific industry or market sector conditions.
75679_15_ITEM7_P108_S4	We may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions, expected future operating results, or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets .
75679_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	We have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2014, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between 25% and 26%, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	We believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
75679_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2014, the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by 94% and $179.4 million, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	The fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 11% and $9.7 million as of October 31, 2014, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $132.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2014, and that primarily expire from 2020 to 2034, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 to 2007, 2013, and 2014 and that expire in 2024 to 2027, 2033, and 2034, respectively.
75679_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $1.7 million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire.
75679_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014, based on management s belief that future reversals of existing temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	I Item 1 Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	Inflation We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014, as a result of the material weakness described below.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) in 2013.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2014, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to a material weakness associated with inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the calculation of our income tax expense during all quarters in 2014.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	See note 14, Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited), included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of this immaterial error correction.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management's Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness In the first quarter of 2015 we will remediate our inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the calculation of our income tax expense.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	We will strengthen the design and operation of our controls over the initial calculation and the review and approval of the calculation.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	W e will reinforce to staff responsible that a heightened sense of awareness is needed during the initial preparation, as well as to any subsequent changes, and during analysis of the result.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Changes to the process will be documented to ensure consistent application.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting On July 22, 2013, we closed the transactions under the Wireless Agreement entered into on June 4, 2012, pursuant to which the parties agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	In 2014 we implemented AWN's internal control over financial reporting associated with the provision of wholesale services to ACS.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2014, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P8_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P8_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.

75679_15_ITEM15_P292_S0	The right to indemnification continues as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent, and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person.

75679_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Also refer to Note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
75679_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	General We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues.
75679_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	We provide a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, governmental entities, and educational and medical institutions primarily in Alaska under our GCI brand.
75679_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
75679_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Since GCI's founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets.
75679_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.
75679_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	In recent years, we expanded our efforts in wireless and presently operate the only statewide wireless network.
75679_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated consolidated revenues of $978.5 million .
75679_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	We ended the period with 227,800 wireless subscribers, 140,000 cable modem subscribers and 133,300 basic video subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Development of our Business During the Past Fiscal Year Purchase of Alaska Communications System Group, Inc.'s Wireless Subscriber Base and Its Interest in The Alaska Wireless Network.
75679_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	On February 2, 2015, we purchased Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc.'s ( ACS ) interest in The Alaska Wireless Network, LLC ("AWN") and substantially all the assets of ACS and its affiliates related to ACS s wireless operations ( Acquired ACS Assets ) (collectively the "Wireless Acquisition").
75679_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Under the terms of the agreement, we transfered to ACS a cash payment of $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and agreed to terminate or amend certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	The Acquired ACS Assets include substantially all of ACS s wireless subscriber assets, including subscriber contracts, and certain of ACS s CDMA network assets, including fiber strands and associated cell site electronics and microwave facilities and associated electronics.
75679_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We assumed from ACS post-closing liabilities of ACS and its affiliates under contracts assumed by us and liabilities with respect to the ownership by ACS of its equity interest in AWN to the extent accruing and related to the period after closing.
75679_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	All other liabilities were retained by ACS and its affiliates.
75679_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	We intend to continue to increase Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 10 in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", using the following strategies:
75679_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Expand Our Product Portfolio and Footprint in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	Throughout our history, we have successfully added and expect to continue to add new products to our product portfolio.
75679_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We have a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for our customers, and we continue to assess revenue-enhancing opportunities that create value for our customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of our network coverage, we are currently pursuing or expect to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of our facilities, enhance our ability to serve our existing customers needs and attract new customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	Additionally, due to the unique market conditions in Alaska, we, and in some cases our customers, participate in several federal (and to a lesser extent locally) subsidized programs designed to financially support the implementation and purchase of telecommunications services like ours in high cost areas.
75679_16_ITEM1_P13_S5	With these programs we have been able to expand our network into previously undeveloped areas of Alaska and, for the first time, offer comprehensive communications services in many rural parts of the state where we would not otherwise be able to construct facilities within appropriate return-on-investment requirements.
75679_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions of in-state telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our management team will continue to actively pursue and make investments that we believe fit with our strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.
75679_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We sell new and enhanced services and products to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.
75679_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
75679_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have positioned ourselves as a customer service leader in the Alaska communications market.
75679_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We operate our own customer service department and have empowered our customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call.
75679_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	We prioritize our customer services to expedite handling of our most valuable customers issues, particularly for our largest commercial customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe our integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows us to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
75679_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	We continue to expand and evolve our integrated network for the delivery of our services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving our customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization.
75679_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	By offering multiple services, we are better able to leverage our network assets and increase returns on our invested capital.
75679_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	We periodically evaluate our network assets and continually monitor technological developments that we can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
75679_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Overview Our two reportable segments are Wireless and Wireline.
75679_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our Wireless segment provides wholesale wireless services to wireless carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our Wireline segment offers services and products under three major customer groups as follows:
75679_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Consumer we offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video, and voice services to residential customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Business Services we offer a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to businesses, governmental entities, and educational institutions and wholesale data and voice services to common carrier customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Managed Broadband we offer Internet, data network and managed services to rural schools and health organizations and regulated voice services to residential and commercial customers in rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The following discussion includes information about significant services and products, sales and marketing, facilities, competition and seasonality for each of our reportable segments.
75679_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	financial condition and results of operations please see Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Wireless Segment Wireless segment revenues for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Wireless segment.
75679_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Services and Products Our Wireless segment offers wholesale wireless services and products to wireless carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	We provide network transport and access to our wireless network to wireless carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	These services allow wireless carriers to provide full wireless services to their customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Sales and Marketing Our Wireless segment sales and marketing efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of wireless carriers we serve and the number of voice and data circuits leased.
75679_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	We sell our wireless services primarily through direct contact marketing.
75679_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Facilities We own and operate a statewide network providing voice and data services to the urban and rural communities of Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our statewide wireless network provides 2G GSM/EDGE service, 2G CDMA, 3G UMTS/HSPA+, EVDO, and 4G LTE data service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	We continue to expand and upgrade these services to provide a modern network for Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P29_S3	We own and operate Wi-Fi access points that create a Wi-Fi network branded as TurboZone in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kenai-Soldotna, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other areas of the State ("TurboZone").
75679_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Competition Our Wireless segment competes with AT T, Verizon, and smaller companies.
75679_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	We compete in the wholesale wireless market by offering competitive rates and by providing a comprehensive statewide network to meet the needs of carrier customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Seasonality Wireless segment revenues derived from our carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction, commercial fishing, and oil and gas activities.
75679_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow, and short daylight hours.
75679_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Major Customer Verizon was the only major customer of the Wireless segment in 2015 and 2014.
75679_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	We had no Wireless segment major customers in 2013.
75679_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Wireline Segment Wireline segment revenues for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Wireline segment.
75679_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Services and Products Our Wireline segment offers services and products to three major customer groups as follows:
75679_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Consumer - We offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video, and voice services to residential customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video, and voice services to businesses, governmental entities, and educational institutions and wholesale data and voice services to common carrier customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	Additionally, we sell advertising on our broadcast television stations and cable network.
75679_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	We offer data and managed services to rural schools and health organizations and regulated voice services to residential and commercial customers in rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Sales and Marketing We offer our services directly to consumer and business customers through our call center, direct mail advertising, television advertising, Internet advertising, local media advertising, and through our retail stores.
75679_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve, selling bundled services, and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities.
75679_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	We sell our managed services, wholesale data and voice services, and data services to rural schools and health organizations through direct contact marketing.
75679_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Facilities We operate a modern, competitive communications network providing switched and dedicated voice and broadband services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our fiber network employs digital transmission technology over our fiber optic facilities within Alaska and between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
75679_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	We serve many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications.
75679_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	Each of our satellite transponders is backed up on alternate spacecraft with multiple backup transponders.
75679_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	We operate a hybrid fiber optic cable and digital microwave system ( TERRA ) linking Anchorage with the Bristol Bay, Yukon-Kuskokwim, and northwest regions of the state.
75679_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our video businesses are located throughout Alaska and serve the majority of the population.
75679_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our facilities include hybrid-fiber-coax plant and head-end distribution equipment.
75679_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	The majority of our locations on the fiber routes are served from head-end distribution equipment in Anchorage.
75679_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	All of our cable systems are completely digital.
75679_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol data services are delivered to an Ethernet port located at the service end-point.
75679_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our management platform continuously monitors the network and service end-points for performance.
75679_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.
75679_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	The management platform has the capability to remotely access network elements and service end-points, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service end-point.
75679_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	This management platform allows us to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
75679_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Competition We operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment and information products and services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior.
75679_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition We compete with AT T, Verizon, and other community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.
75679_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The national wireless carriers with whom we compete, AT T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than ours.
75679_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.
75679_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, bundled services, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, statewide network coverage and capacity, TurboZone, the type of wireless handsets offered, and the availability of differentiated features and services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Competition is based upon price and pricing plans, service bundles, the types of services offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	We compete with other providers some of which are headquartered outside of Alaska and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
75679_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems.
75679_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone.
75679_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
75679_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Our video systems face competition from services and devices that offer Internet video streaming and distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, as well as alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals, including DBS, digital video over telephone lines, broadband IP-based services, wireless and satellite master antenna television systems.
75679_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems.
75679_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Online video services via the Internet are a major growing source of competition for our video services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	Additionally, some online video services are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content.
75679_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	We believe that the greatest source of external competition for our video services comes from the DBS industry.
75679_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Two major companies, DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering high-power DBS services in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Competitive forces may be counteracted by offering expanded programming through digital services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Digital delivery technology is being utilized in all of our systems.
75679_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have retransmission agreements with various broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into certain of our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	Additionally, our ownership of television stations provides us the opportunity to create unique content for our subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.
75679_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
75679_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Voice Services and Products Competition Our most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	We also compete against Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"), long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance.
75679_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	We have competed by offering what we believe is excellent customer service and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Seasonality Our Wireline segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Major Customer We had no Wireline segment major customers in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
75679_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Sales and Marketing Company-wide Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, data and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and managed services expenditures, and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Environmental Regulations We undertake activities that may, under certain circumstances, affect the environment.
75679_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Accordingly, they may be subject to federal, state, and local laws designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
75679_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and National Historic Preservation Act to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
75679_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon.
75679_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	We obtain federal, state, and local permits, as required, for our projects and operations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	We are unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
75679_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses We do not hold patents, franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	We hold a number of federally registered service marks used by our reportable segments.
75679_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	We hold licenses for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Wireline segment.
75679_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	We hold various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use.
75679_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	However, we expect these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
75679_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	We hold licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years.
75679_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area.
75679_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Regulation Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Wireless Services and Products General .
75679_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	As wireless licensees, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
75679_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, modification, and registration of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas.
75679_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The High Cost Program of the Universal Service Fund ("USF") pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	On November 29, 2011, the FCC released rules reforming the methodology for distributing USF high cost support for voice and broadband services, as well as the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	Support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers ( CETCs ) serving areas that generally include Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau followed national reforms and had support per provider per service area capped as of January 1, 2012, and a five-step phase-down commenced on July 1, 2012, which is currently frozen pending the adoption of a successor mechanism.
75679_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	Support to Remote Alaska locations was capped as of January 1, 2012 and is being distributed on a per-line basis until the implementation of a successor funding mechanism.
75679_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	A further rulemaking process to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway.
75679_16_ITEM1_P79_S4	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	On February 6, 2012, the FCC released its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program.
75679_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	The order adopted several reforms, including a requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	recertify Lifeline subscribers could materially adversely affect our Lifeline revenues and/or increase our costs in the form of FCC fines for failure to comply with Lifeline rules.
75679_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	We have completed negotiations and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks for more information.
75679_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s phone number and approximate location.
75679_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	Due to Alaska s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.
75679_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC s standard.
75679_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	We received a separate waiver regarding the FCC s recently adopted text-to-911 rules due to technical limitations in our network and the inability of vendors to provide a workable solution, but have since developed a text-to-911 technical solution and have certified to the FCC that we are now capable of meeting the FCC requirements.
75679_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P89_S3	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_16_ITEM1_P89_S4	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P89_S5	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to customers and result in higher costs to customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_16_ITEM1_P91_S2	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	Internet-based Services and Products General .
75679_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the global operation of the Internet.
75679_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_16_ITEM1_P93_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_16_ITEM1_P93_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	The vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_16_ITEM1_P94_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect our costs and the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	On November 20, 2011, the FCC issued rules governing the activities of cable operators and other Internet service providers in connection with the provision of Internet service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	The rules applicable to cable operators and other wireline providers generally prohibited blocking lawful content and prohibiting unreasonable discrimination, outside of reasonable network management, as well as imposing transparency requirements.
75679_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	For wireless providers, the transparency rule and a less restrictive version of the blocking rule applied.
75679_16_ITEM1_P97_S3	On January 14, 2014, in a case challenging these rules, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules, upheld the transparency rules, and remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.
75679_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	The majority opinion held that the FCC possessed the general statutory authority to adopt these rules, but did so in a manner that violated specific statutory prohibitions against imposing common carrier regulations on non-telecommunications services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	This order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	The order also strengthens its transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S3	The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S4	These rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S5	The order refrains from applying rate regulation and tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P99_S6	While we do not believe that the FCC order conflicts with our existing practices or offerings, the order will impose regulatory burdens, likely increase our costs, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	The RCA previously regulated the basic service tier on our video system in Juneau.
75679_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	On June 3, 2015, the FCC adopted a rebuttable presumption that cable providers are subject to Effective Competition, and the RCA did not rebut that presumption by the filing deadline set by the new rules.
75679_16_ITEM1_P102_S2	Because the RCA did not rebut the presumption, we can now unwind our informational tariff in Juneau, with proper customer notice under the FCC rules, and apply our statewide basic service tier pricing in Juneau.
75679_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P105_S1	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	The FCC mandated, effective July 1, 2007, that all new set-top video navigation devices must segregate the security function from the navigation function.
75679_16_ITEM1_P106_S1	The new devices are more expensive than existing equipment, and compliance would increase our cost of providing video services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	In late 2014, the President signed into law the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 ( STELAR ), which repeals the navigation device integrated security ban effective December 30, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	On April 21, 2010, the FCC adopted a Notice of Inquiry to consider ways to develop a standardized interface for accessing video content, as an alternative to set-top boxes.
75679_16_ITEM1_P108_S1	Adoption of new rules or standards in this area could affect the manner in which we deliver video products to our customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	STELAR, the FCC has convened a Downloadable Security Technical Advisory Committee ( DSTAC ) to consider and recommend performance objectives, technical capabilities and technical standards to promote competitive availability of navigation devices.
75679_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	DSTAC released a report dated August 28, 2015 that presented two proposals for handling non-security elements of set-top boxes, called the Application-based proposal and the Competitive Navigation proposal (also called AllVid ).
75679_16_ITEM1_P109_S2	The FCC adopted proposed AllVid rules on Feb. 18, 2016 which, among other things, mandate that multichannel video programmer distributors ("MVPD") use information flows that allow manufacturers, retailers, and other companies that are not affiliated with an MVPD to design and build competitive navigation devices.
75679_16_ITEM1_P109_S3	GCI joined a coalition opposing the proposed rules.
75679_16_ITEM1_P109_S4	We are unable to predict how this will proceed or if the FCC will take action on the proposed rules after conclusion of the comment period.
75679_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_16_ITEM1_P110_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_16_ITEM1_P110_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_16_ITEM1_P110_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_16_ITEM1_P110_S5	In addition, on April 7, 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services, and on November 17, 2015, took further steps to bring telecommunications and cable pole attachment rates into parity.
75679_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	Though the general purpose of the rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.
75679_16_ITEM1_P111_S1	In addition, because the RCA has adopted its own formula, the FCC s reclassification of broadband service as a telecommunications service is not anticipated to have any near-term impact.
75679_16_ITEM1_P111_S2	We cannot predict the likelihood of the RCA changing its formula, adopting the federal formula, or relinquishing its oversight of pole attachments to the FCC, any of which could increase the cost of our operations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P112_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_16_ITEM1_P112_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_16_ITEM1_P112_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_16_ITEM1_P112_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.
75679_16_ITEM1_P113_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P114_S0	Wireline Voice Services and Products General.
75679_16_ITEM1_P115_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P115_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P115_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_16_ITEM1_P116_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_16_ITEM1_P116_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1_P116_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_16_ITEM1_P116_S3	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service for information on USF reform.
75679_16_ITEM1_P117_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_16_ITEM1_P118_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_16_ITEM1_P118_S1	We participated in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_16_ITEM1_P118_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_16_ITEM1_P119_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_16_ITEM1_P119_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P120_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Wireline Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_16_ITEM1_P121_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_16_ITEM1_P122_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_16_ITEM1_P122_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC released rules to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_16_ITEM1_P122_S2	We do not anticipate that the adopted changes, for which implementation began in 2012, will have a material impact on our operations, except that the reduction of interstate access rates generally will result in a cost savings on access charges to us.
75679_16_ITEM1_P122_S3	However, the details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and they could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_16_ITEM1_P122_S4	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our operations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P123_S0	The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_16_ITEM1_P123_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be changed in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rule modifications that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_16_ITEM1_P123_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_16_ITEM1_P123_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_16_ITEM1_P124_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_16_ITEM1_P124_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_16_ITEM1_P124_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_16_ITEM1_P125_S0	The Communications Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks.
75679_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	On January 30, 2014, the FCC adopted an order calling for experiments to examine how best to accelerate the technological and regulatory transitions from traditional TDM-based networks to IP-based technologies.
75679_16_ITEM1_P126_S2	Although no entity has proposed conducting a technology transition experiment in our service territory in response to the FCC s January 2014 order, additional proposals for experiments are possible.
75679_16_ITEM1_P126_S3	We cannot predict whether additional proposals for experiments might be submitted to the FCC nor any resulting proceedings or their effect on us.
75679_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	The FCC also has other open dockets through which it might make changes to the regulatory regime applicable to IP-based networks.
75679_16_ITEM1_P127_S1	A change in regulatory obligation or classification that interferes with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
75679_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	On December 12, 2012, the FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund to supplement the existing Rural Health Care Program of the USF.
75679_16_ITEM1_P128_S1	Healthcare providers can choose to participate under either the existing Rural Health Care Program or the new Healthcare Connect Fund.
75679_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this change but we do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our operations.
75679_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	On July 11 and December 11, 2014, the FCC adopted orders modernizing the USF Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate").
75679_16_ITEM1_P130_S1	These orders, among other things, increased the annual E-Rate cap by approximately $1.5 billion, designated funds for internal connections within schools and libraries, and eliminated funding for certain legacy services, such as voice, to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide.
75679_16_ITEM1_P130_S2	These orders did not have a material effect on the overall E-Rate support available to our schools and libraries customers, and therefore did not materially affect our revenue from such customers.
75679_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	We do not have significant foreign operations or export sales.
75679_16_ITEM1_P131_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	Company-Sponsored Research We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	Employees We employed 2,370 persons as of December 31, 2015, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_16_ITEM1_P133_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_16_ITEM1_P133_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	Other No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We face increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	We also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our wholesale customers including our major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they contract with us to use our network to provide service on their behalf.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We would experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of our wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is provided on our network.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Some of our wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than we do.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We expect to negotiate long-term contracts with such customers to offer competitive alternatives while retaining significant traffic on our network.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We cannot predict whether such negotiations will be successful.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our inability to negotiate such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Part 1 Item 1 Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers perceptions of our services, and customer care quality.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Managing these factors and subscribers expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Some of our competitors have national networks which enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to successfully complete the integration of the wireless subscribers acquired from ACS in the Wireless Acquisition or we may be unable to realize the remaining anticipated synergies.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	On February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition which included the acquisition of wireless subscribers from ACS.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively complete the integration of the new wireless subscribers or recognize the remaining expected synergies.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The integration that followed the subscriber acquisition continues to require significant time and focus from management and diverts attention from the day-to-day operations of our other businesses and our strategic objectives.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Integration difficulties and an inability to realize the remaining anticipated synergies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Although the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	While we believe that we are currently in compliance with such FCC rules, the failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The FCC requires local notice in any community in which it is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	This rule could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The order also strengthens transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The new rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	The order refrains from imposing rate regulation or tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply its new rules.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, although the FCC forbore from many of the provisions of Title II, we cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply the statutory provisions and regulations from which it did not forbear.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	It is possible that the FCC could interpret or apply its new rules or Title II statutory provisions or regulations in a way that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	There also is a risk class action lawsuits arising under the provisions of Title II from which the FCC did not forbear could have similar negative impacts.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Proposals have been made before Congress to mandate Open Internet regulation that could supplement or supplant in whole or part the FCC s new rules.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We currently cannot predict whether any such legislation will be adopted nor what impacts are most likely.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact on the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to unbundled network elements.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Part 1 Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	This support was 19% , 19% , and 18% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We had USF net receivables of $98.1 million and $109.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireless Services and Products Universal Service and Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The decline in our Wireline segment voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We expect our Wireline voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenues will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") program for funding our TERRA-NW project.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In 2011 and 2012 we entered into three separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA-NW project.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which were restricted for use on TERRA-NW.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $56.0 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in December 2019.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Failure to complete development, testing and deployment of a new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Unfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	While it is often difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We offer wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Oil prices have dropped precipitously recently which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues come from the oil industry.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of declining oil prices.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Prolonged periods of low oil prices will adversely impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In addition, if the Alaska state government fails to implement appropriate structural budgetary reforms, we may potentially have to reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could limit our opportunities for future growth.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Additionally, the customer base in Alaska is limited and we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Natural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that our technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Additionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Cyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Cyberattacks against our technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of our operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to our customers, our assets, and our reputation.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	To date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Nevertheless, we engage in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to us, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard our infrastructure and confidential customer information.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Despite these preventive and detective actions, our efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Some of the most significant risks to our information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:
75679_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Disruptions and damage caused by natural disasters, power surges, or equipment failure.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer data.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Relatedly, a network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures,litigation, fines, and sanctions, lost revenues from business interruption, and damage to the public s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Increases in data usage on our wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Video streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	As use of these newer services continues to grow, our customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on our wireless network.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P67_S5	While we believe demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude us from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Prolonged service interruptions or system failures could affect our business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	We are able to deliver services and serve our customers only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Disruption to our billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P69_S6	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA facilities and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our facilities also include TERRA and its extensions which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P71_S2	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or of our unringed TERRA facility and its extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P78_S3	We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our significant debt and capital lease obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, other debt or capital leases.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and capital lease obligations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	On December 31, 2015, we had long-term debt of $1,290.0 million and long-term capital lease obligations of $59.7 million .
75679_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Our high level of debt and capital lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P85_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P86_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P86_S4	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P86_S5	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P89_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace one or both.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P92_S1	If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow could decrease.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Any significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We had $520.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2015, consisting of goodwill of $239.3 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $86.3 million and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Our broadcast licenses represent permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P100_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, and the fair value of the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P100_S3	The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P100_S4	These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P100_S5	Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	GCI, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax returns as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	At December 31, 2015, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $340.5 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	its market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P104_S1	This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P106_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P106_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P106_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P106_S5	However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	A significant percentage of GCI's voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	As of December 31, 2015, GCI's executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 14% of its combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 24% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P108_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI's Board.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We invest in early-stage, venture backed companies.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The companies in which we invest are entrants to markets with new products or services.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P110_S1	These companies generally have revenue that does not cover the companies operating and capital expenditures.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P110_S2	As a result, the companies typically operate with monthly net losses and may require additional funding for operating and capital.
75679_16_ITEM1A_P110_S3	Given that, among other things, these companies are at an early stage in their life cycle and are often proving their business model, these companies may fail, go bankrupt, and lose all or substantially all of their value which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease most of our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our Wireline and Wireless segments have properties that consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.

75679_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
75679_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in Note 1(ad) in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of of this annual report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
75679_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	See also our Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska in 1997 to affect the issuance of Senior Notes.
75679_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	GCI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, received through its initial capitalization all ownership interests in subsidiaries previously held by GCI.
75679_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Shares of GCI s Class A common stock are traded on the Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol of GNCMA.
75679_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Shares of GCI s Class B common stock are traded on the OTCQX market.
75679_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Shares of GCI, Inc. s common stock are wholly owned by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	The GCI and GCI, Inc. consolidated financial statements include substantially the same account activity.
75679_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act ) enacted on April 5, 2012.
75679_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.
75679_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
75679_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
75679_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.
75679_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
75679_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	General Overview Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins.
75679_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Update on Economic Conditions We offer wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Oil prices have dropped precipitously recently which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues come from the oil industry.
75679_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of declining oil prices.
75679_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	Prolonged periods of low oil prices will adversely impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	In addition, if the Alaska state government fails to implement appropriate structural budgetary reforms, we may potentially have to reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could limit our opportunities for future growth.
75679_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Major Developments On July 22, 2013, we closed the transactions under the Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement ("Wireless Agreement") and other related agreements entered into on June 4, 2012 by and among ACS, GCI, ACS Wireless, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ACS, GCI Wireless Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, and AWN, pursuant to which the parties agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of GCI, ACS and their affiliates to AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	This transaction provided a statewide network with the spectrum mix, scale, advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with Verizon Wireless and AT T Mobility in Alaska.
75679_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Until the closing of the Wireless Acquisition described below, AWN provided wholesale services to GCI and ACS, and GCI and ACS used the AWN network to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Under the terms of the Wireless Agreement, we contributed our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Additionally, ACS contributed its wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	As consideration for the contributed business assets and liabilities, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, a one-third ownership interest in AWN, and preferential distributions totaling $0.8 million, $50.0 million, and $22.0 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	As part of closing, we borrowed $100.0 million under our Senior Credit Facility to fund the purchase of wireless network assets from ACS.
75679_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	On February 2, 2015, we purchased ACS' interest in AWN and substantially all the assets of ACS and its affiliates related to ACS s wireless operations ( Acquired ACS Assets ) (collectively the "Wireless Acquisition").
75679_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, we transfered to ACS a cash payment of $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and agreed to terminate or amend certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Acquired ACS Assets include substantially all of ACS s wireless subscriber assets, including subscriber contracts, and certain of ACS s CDMA network assets, including fiber strands and associated cell site electronics and microwave facilities and associated electronics.
75679_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	We assumed from ACS post-closing liabilities of ACS and its affiliates under contracts assumed by us and liabilities with respect to the ownership by ACS of its equity interest in AWN to the extent accruing and related to the period after closing.
75679_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	All other liabilities were retained by ACS and its affiliates.
75679_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Following the close of the Wireless Acquisition, AWN is a wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	We funded the purchase with a $275.0 million Term B loan under our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI.
75679_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	As an ETC, we receive support from the USF for the provision of wireless and wireline local access service in high cost areas.
75679_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The high cost support methodology segregates the Remote areas in Alaska from the support methodology for all urban areas, including Alaska Urban locations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our future revenue recognition for both Remote and Urban high cost support is dependent upon the functionality and timing of an operational successor funding mechanism.
75679_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Rulemaking is underway to consider a successor funding mechanism.
75679_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on high cost support available to us, but our revenue for providing services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of USF support.
75679_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	The following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (underlying data rounded to the nearest thousand):
75679_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings plus imputed interest on financed devices before: Net interest expense, Income taxes, Depreciation and amortization expense, Loss on extinguishment of debt, Software impairment charge, Share-based compensation expense, Accretion expense, Loss attributable to non-controlling interest resulting from NMTC transactions, Gains and impairment losses on equity and cost method investments, and Other non-cash adjustments.
75679_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in understanding and evaluating operating performance as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures.
75679_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	In addition, multiples of current or projected Adjusted EBITDA are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value.
75679_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Overview of Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold Total revenues increased 12% from $811.6 million in 2013 to $910.2 million in 2014 and increased 8% to $978.5 million in 2015 .
75679_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Revenue increased in our Wireline segment and decreased in our Wireless segment in 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Revenue increased in both segments in 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Total Cost of Goods Sold increased 8% from $280.5 million in 2013 to $302.7 million in 2014 and increased 6% to $322.3 million in 2015 .
75679_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Cost of Goods Sold decreased in our Wireless segment and increased in our Wireline segment in 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Cost of Goods Sold decreased in our Wireline segment and increased in our Wireless segment for 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Wireless segment was impacted by the Wireless Acquisition discussed above in the General Overview section.
75679_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	From the formation of AWN in 2013 to the close of the Wireless Acquisition on February 2, 2015, AWN provided wholesale services to GCI and ACS and roaming services to other wireless carriers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	During that time, AWN received a portion of revenue from GCI and ACS' retail wireless customers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Additionally, AWN paid an incentive to GCI and ACS for the sale of wireless handsets to their respective retail customers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Following the close of the Wireless Acquisition, the Wireless segment continues to provide roaming services to other wireless carriers and provides wholesale services to the Wireline segment for which it receives a portion of revenue from wireless retail customers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	Additionally, the Wireless segment started recording a portion of the wireless equipment costs to encourage the Wireline segment to transition customers from our CDMA network to our GSM network.
75679_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Wireless segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	See Note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for information on the change in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	The decrease in revenue for 2015 is primarily due to a $26.2 million decrease in plan fee revenue due to our transition to a fixed percentage allocation of plan fee revenue from the Wireline segment following the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The decrease is partially offset by the following:
75679_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	A $8.6 million decrease in the contra-revenue wireless handset cash incentives to ACS for the sale of wireless handsets to their retail customers prior to the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Although roaming and backhaul revenues continued to be strong through 2015, we expect roaming and backhaul revenues to decrease by $49.0 million to $59.0 million in 2016 due to long-term roaming agreements we have entered into with our our largest roaming partners.
75679_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The increase in revenue for 2014 is primarily due to the following:
75679_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	A $7.3 million increase in private line revenue due to increased demand for backhaul capacity.
75679_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The increase is partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in the contra-revenue wireless handset cash incentives to ACS in 2014 for the sale of wireless handsets to their retail customers due to the July 22, 2013 close of the initial AWN transaction.
75679_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold The decrease in Cost of Goods Sold for 2015 is primarily due to the following:
75679_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	A $9.6 million decrease in wireless equipment costs.
75679_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The Wireless segment gave a wireless equipment subsidy to the Wireline segment in accordance with the AWN agreements in 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	discontinued following the February 2, 2015 close of of the Wireless Acquisition, but the Wireless segment started recording a portion of the wireless equipment costs to encourage the Wireline segment to transition customers from our CDMA network to our GSM network which partially offset the decrease.
75679_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	A $4.8 million decrease in distribution and capacity costs primarily because we were able to extend an agreement with a vendor which resulted in the resolution of certain issues and the release of the related reserve and a reduction in capacity costs and costs to terminate long distance traffic.
75679_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The decrease is partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in network maintenance costs primarily due to the the expansion of our network and an increase in the utility and operating costs.
75679_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We continue to work with our roaming partners to manage our roaming costs.
75679_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	We primarily control our roaming costs through multi-year contracts with our roaming partners that allow our retail wireless customers to roam on their networks.
75679_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	The increase in Cost of Goods Sold for 2014 is primarily due to the following:
75679_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	A $5.1 million increase in wireless equipment costs.
75679_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	During the period from April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Additional increases in network maintenance costs due to the growth of the wireless network due to the July 22, 2013 close of the initial AWN transaction and increased emphasis on our wireless network.
75679_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 is primarily due to decreases in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and selling, general and administrative expense partially offset by a decrease in revenue as described above in Wireless Segment Revenues.
75679_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2014 is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in Wireless Segment Revenues.
75679_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	These increases were partially offset by increased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Wireline Segment Overview Please see "Part I - Item 1.
75679_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Business - Description of our Business by Reportable Segment - Overview" for a description of our Wireline segment services and products by major customer group.
75679_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The components of Wireline segment revenue are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	See Note 10 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for information on the change in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.

75679_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	4 A high-definition/digital video recorder ("HD/DVR") converter box is defined as one box rented by a digital programming or basic tier subscriber.
75679_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	A digital programming or basic tier subscriber is not required to rent an HD/DVR converter box to receive service.
75679_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	5 Applicable average monthly video revenues divided by the average number of basic subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2015, 2014, and 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	6 A local access line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network.
75679_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	A Lifeline wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device that is eligible for Lifeline support.
75679_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Universal Service Fund's Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at affordable rates.
75679_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	8 A prepaid wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device where service is purchased in advance of use.
75679_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The purchased credit is used to pay for wireless services at the point the service is accessed or consumed.
75679_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	9 A postpaid wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device where service is provided by a prior arrangement with a subscriber and the subscriber is billed after the fact according to their use of wireless services at the end of each month.
75679_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	10 Average monthly wireless revenues, excluding those from common carrier customers, divided by the number of wireless subscribers at the end of each month for each of the months in 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	Average monthly wireless revenues, excluding those from common carrier customers, divided by the average of wireless subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2014 and 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P53_S3	This calculation includes applicable revenue from the Wireline segment - Consumer - Wireless and Wireline segment - Business Services - Wireless and wholesale wireless revenues earned from GCI retail subscribers included in the Wireless segment.
75679_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	11 Applicable average monthly cable modem revenues divided by the average number of subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2015, 2014, and 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Consumer The items contributing to the increase in wireless revenue for 2015 include:
75679_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	A $14.7 million or 548% increase in plan fee revenue primarily due to the acquisition of ACS' wireless subscribers following the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	A $27.2 million or 446% increase in equipment sales revenue due to an increase in the number of financed devices.
75679_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	In late 2014, we began encouraging our customers to purchase wireless devices through our financing program instead of subsidizing their device purchases.
75679_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	We offer a discount on the monthly plan fee for customers who choose to finance their device rather than buying a subsidized device.
75679_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	The transition from subsidized devices to more financed devices will result in higher revenues when a contract is signed and a decrease in the monthly Wireless ARPU going forward.
75679_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a $20.3 million or 20% and $12.1 million or 14% increase in cable modem revenue for 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to an increase in the average number of subscribers and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds and higher usage limits in 2015 and 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Consumer video revenue faces challenges as more customers choose to have their video content delivered via the Internet.
75679_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, this selection may result in additional data service revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We expect Consumer voice revenue to continue to decrease due to a growing number of customers using wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local and long distance calling.
75679_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Business Services Business Services data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.
75679_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	This revenue faces challenges due to the continued decline of oil prices which negatively impacts certain of our customers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Additionally, we face rate compression for data transport and storage services.
75679_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The decrease in data revenue in 2014 is primarily due to a $14.1 million or 24% decrease in managed services project revenue due to a decrease in special project work.
75679_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	The decrease in 2014 is partially offset by a $4.6 million or 5% increase in data transport and storage revenue due to increased demand for increased capacity and data speeds.
75679_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Advertising is the primary driver for video revenue, therefore, we see large variations in revenue due to the election cycle or other major televised events such as the Olympics.
75679_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The variations may be more extreme in years when there are highly contested political elections or ballot initiatives.
75679_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The $14.4 million or 43% decrease in video revenue in 2015 is primarily due to a decrease in advertising after the completion of the latest election cycle in 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	The $18.1 million or 119% increase in video revenue in 2014 primarily results from an increase in advertising sales due to the election cycle and our acquisition of the television broadcast stations in the fourth quarter of 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Business Services voice revenue continues to face competition and rate compression and to a lesser extent the substitution of wireless devices.
75679_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	The data revenue increases in 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to a $21.1 million or 21% and $7.2 million or 8% increase in monthly contract revenue, respectively, due to new ConnectMD and SchoolAccess customers and increased data network capacity purchased by our existing ConnectMD and SchoolAccess customers due to increased demand.
75679_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	The individually significant items contributing to the 2015 increase in Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold include:
75679_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	A 82% or $22.5 million increase in wireless device Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to an increase in the number of handsets sold and and a change in the allocation between the Wireline and Wireless segments following the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The Wireline segment received a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agreements during 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	started recording a portion of the wireless equipment costs to encourage the Wireline segment to transition customers from our CDMA network to our GSM network which partially offset the increase.
75679_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	A 8% or $5.5 million increase in video Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to increased rates paid to programmers partially offset by a decrease in basic video subscribers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	We expect to face continued increases in programming costs that may require us to drop certain channels or increase the rates paid by our customers that may result in a loss of additional video customers.
75679_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The 2014 decreases are partially offset by the following individually significant items:
75679_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	A 11% or $2.7 million increase in wireless device Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to an increase in the number of handsets sold.
75679_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	The increase in 2014 was partially offset by an increase in the subsidy.
75679_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Through the initial AWN transaction close the Wireless segment recorded the Cost of Goods Sold related to wireless equipment sales to retail customers based upon equipment sales and agreed-upon subsidy rates.
75679_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Any amount in excess of this subsidy was recorded in the Wireline segment.
75679_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	Subsequent to the transaction close and through March 31, 2014, although permitted, the Wireline segment was unable to meet the requirements in order to request a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agreements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for 2014 is primarily due to an increase in revenues as described above in "Wireline Segment Revenues" partially offset by an increase in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireline Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $44.7 million to $338.4 million for 2015 and $22.6 million to $293.6 million for 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Individually significant items contributing to the increases include:
75679_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 35% , 32% , and 33% of revenue for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The 2015 increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to the costs related to the acquisition of ACS' wireless subscribers and its non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.5 million to $181.8 million and $23.0 million to $170.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increases in 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to new assets placed in service in those years partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during those years.
75679_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	Additionally, we recorded an increase of $8.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 for the assets acquired from ACS as part of the AWN transaction.
75679_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Software Impairment Charge Software impairment charge increased $29.8 million in 2015 primarily due to an impairment charge as discussed below.
75679_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we internally developed computer software to replace our wireless, Internet, video, local service, and long distance customer billing systems.
75679_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, we completed a detailed assessment of our progress to date and determined it was no longer probable that the computer software being developed would be completed and placed in service.
75679_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	Our assessment concluded that the cost of continuing the development would be much higher than originally estimated, and the timing and scope risks were substantial.
75679_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	We identified development work, hardware, and software recorded as Construction in Progress through the first quarter of 2015, that may be applicable to our replacement customer billing solution, future internally developed software, and other system needs and therefore should remain capital assets.
75679_16_ITEM7_P81_S4	We considered the remaining capital expenditures for this billing system to have a fair value of $0 and recorded an impairment charge of $20.7 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P81_S5	We have signed a contract with an established billing solution provider and have started work on the multi-year implementation.
75679_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, we reassessed our plans for our internally developed machine-to-machine billing system and decided to no longer market this system to third parties.
75679_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	Accordingly we recognized an impairment of $7.1 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, we evaluated user management software we purchased in 2014 and determined that we would not be able to use the software.
75679_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	Accordingly we recognized an impairment of $1.0 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of other income, increased $41.9 million to $116.2 million in 2015 and $4.1 million to $74.3 million in 2014.
75679_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Items contributing to the change in 2015 include:
75679_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	A $2.6 million net loss for adjusting to fair value the assets included in the consideration transfered in the Wireless Acquisition and adjusting to fair value amendments to certain agreements related to the right to use ACS network assets.
75679_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	The increase in 2014 is primarily due to increased interest expense attributable to increased borrowing on our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Income Tax Expense GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Income tax expense totaled $0.1 million , $10.0 million , and $11.0 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	Our effective income tax rate was (1)% , 14% , and 26% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our 2014 and 2013 effective tax rates were impacted by the inclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN in income before income taxes and the exclusion of income taxes on income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	We completed the Wireless Acquisition on February 2, 2015, after which ACS no longer has a non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P89_S4	The change in the 2015 effective tax rate is due the completion of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P89_S5	Furthermore, the 2015 effective tax rate is impacted by the amount of permanent differences in 2015 as compared to our loss before income taxes.
75679_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	At December 31, 2015, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $340.5 million that will begin expiring in 2020 if not utilized, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.7 million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years.
75679_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $139.2 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2015 and that expire from 2020 to 2035, respectively, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2007, and 2013, and that expire in 2024 through 2027, and 2033, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 82% to 87% in the year ending December 31, 2016.
75679_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	The effective tax rate is expected to be much higher due to an increase in the pretax book income amount and the relative impact that the expected tax adjustments have on that pretax income amount.
75679_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	As discussed in the General Overview section of this Item 2, on July 22, 2013, we closed the initial AWN transaction.
75679_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	As consideration, ACS received $100.0 million in cash from GCI, Inc., a one-third ownership percentage in AWN, and $0.8 million, $50.0 million, and $22.0 million in distributions in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	We funded the purchase by borrowing $100.0 million under our Senior Credit Facility on July 17, 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	On February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition to purchase ACS' wireless subscriber base and its one-third ownership interest in AWN for $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and the termination or amendment of certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Following the close of the transaction, AWN is our wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	To fund the purchase from ACS, on February 2, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary, GCI Holdings, Inc., entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement with Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as administrative agent, that included a $275.0 million Term B loan ("Senior Credit Facility").
75679_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	The Senior Credit Facility was subsequently amended on August 3, 2015 ("First Amendment").
75679_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	The interest rate under the Term B loan is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 3.25%, with a 0.75% LIBOR floor.
75679_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Term B loan will mature on February 2, 2022 or December 3, 2020, if our Senior Notes due 2021 are not refinanced prior to such date.
75679_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	On April 1 2015, we closed on the issuance of $450.0 million of new 6.875% Senior Notes due 2025 at an issue price of 99.105%.
75679_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The net proceeds of the offering were used to retire our existing 2019 Notes.
75679_16_ITEM7_P99_S2	We paid closing costs totaling $7.9 million in connection with the offering, which were recorded as deferred loan costs and will be amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes.
75679_16_ITEM7_P99_S3	We recorded a $27.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures.
75679_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $176.2 million and $176.1 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	Depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2016, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to total approximately $210.0 million.
75679_16_ITEM7_P103_S2	This estimate is based on purchases in 2016 regardless of the timing of cash payments.
75679_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 consists primarily of our payment to complete the Wireless Acquisition, costs paid to retire our 2019 Notes, costs paid for the 2025 Notes, and repurchases of GCI's stock partially offset by borrowings on our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI to fund the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Net cash used for financing activities in 2014 consists primarily of payments to ACS for preferential cash distributions, repayment of Rural Utilities Service debt, and repurchases of GCI's common stock.
75679_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	Our borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_16_ITEM7_P104_S3	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI's common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our Senior Credit Facility includes a $240.0 million term loan, a $275.0 million Term B loan, and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility with a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.
75679_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	We had $240.0 million and $272.9 million outstanding under the term loan and Term B loan, respectively, at December 31, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	Under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility we have $22.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, which leaves $127.5 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	A total of $512.9 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	Debt Covenants We are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ), our $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2025 ("2025 Notes"), Senior Credit Facility, and Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	Share Repurchases GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.
75679_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	Under this program, GCI is currently authorized to make up to $95.3 million of repurchases as of December 31, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	During 2015 we repurchased, on GCI's behalf, 3.0 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $47.4 million.
75679_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	The open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10b-18.
75679_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (amounts in thousands):
75679_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our 2021 and 2025 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and the Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	Interest on the amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo note payable are based on variable rates.
75679_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	We used the current rate paid on our Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments.
75679_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	Our 2021 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.0 million through June 2021 and our 2025 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $15.5 million through April 2025.
75679_16_ITEM7_P111_S4	For a discussion of our long-term debt see Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see Note 13 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling $39.0 million which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose and off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1(e) included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for recently issued accounting pronouncements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	Our financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI's Audit Committee.
75679_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2015 are described below.
75679_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	The accounting estimates related to revenues from the high cost, rural health, and schools and libraries USF programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap, our assessment of the impact of new FCC regulations, the potential outcome of FCC proceedings and the potential outcome of USAC contract reviews.
75679_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	Some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods.
75679_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	Significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Receivables We maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	We also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from USAC for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals, health clinics and school districts.
75679_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	We base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances, financial health of specific customers, regional economic data, changes in our collections process, regulatory requirements, and our customers compliance with USAC rules .
75679_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
75679_16_ITEM7_P123_S4	If their financial condition improves, or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings, allowances may be reduced.
75679_16_ITEM7_P123_S5	Such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	Impairment and Useful Lives of Intangible Assets We had $520.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2015, consisting of goodwill of $239.3 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $86.3 million, and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	We are allowed to first assess qualitative factors ( Step Zero ) to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, however, we chose to assess goodwill for impairment using the traditional quantitative two-step process.
75679_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
75679_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics.
75679_16_ITEM7_P126_S2	As a result of this assessment, our reporting units are the same as our two reportable segments.
75679_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
75679_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
75679_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	We are allowed to perform a Step Zero analysis for our annual test over our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill.
75679_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	However, we chose to test for impairment using the traditional quantitative approach.
75679_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	The impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
75679_16_ITEM7_P129_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
75679_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	We use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
75679_16_ITEM7_P130_S2	In addition, a market-based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach.
75679_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_16_ITEM7_P131_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_16_ITEM7_P131_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is from cable system acquisitions.
75679_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	The cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics.
75679_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_16_ITEM7_P133_S1	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_16_ITEM7_P133_S2	We use comparable market transactions from recent FCC auctions, as appropriate, and a hypothetical build-up method to value our wireless licenses.
75679_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	Our broadcast licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to broadcast television stations within a certain geographical area.
75679_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	The amount we have recorded for broadcast licenses is from broadcast television station acquisitions.
75679_16_ITEM7_P134_S2	We used a hypothetical build-up method to value our broadcast licenses.
75679_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	The direct discounted cash flow, hypothetical build-up, and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows, discount rate, customer churn, and customer behaviors and attrition.
75679_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge.
75679_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information.
75679_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
75679_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
75679_16_ITEM7_P136_S3	Events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces, customer behaviors, change in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and changes in discount rates, performance compared to peers, material and ongoing negative economic trends, and specific industry or market sector conditions.
75679_16_ITEM7_P136_S4	We may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results, or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets .
75679_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	We have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2015, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between 23% and 78% , which we believe is a large margin.
75679_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	We believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.
75679_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	Based on our annual impairment test as of October 31, 2015, the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by 65% and $123.9 million , which we believe is a large margin.
75679_16_ITEM7_P138_S1	The fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 224% and $193.4 million as of October 31, 2015, which we believe is a large margin.
75679_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $139.2 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2015, and that primarily expire from 2020 to 2035, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 to 2007, and 2013 and that expire in 2024 to 2027, and 2033, respectively.
75679_16_ITEM7_P139_S2	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $1.7 million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire.
75679_16_ITEM7_P139_S3	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_16_ITEM7_P139_S4	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015, based on management s belief that future reversals of existing temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_16_ITEM7_P139_S5	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect in our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	Regulatory Developments See Part I Item 1.
75679_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	Inflation We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo note payable carries interest rate risk.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our Senior Credit Facility consists of a term loan, Term B loan, and revolving credit facility.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Amounts borrowed under the term loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% or less depending upon our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility agreement).
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Amounts borrowed under the Term B loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Amounts borrowed under the Wells Fargo note payable bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Should the LIBOR rate change, our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	As of December 31, 2015, we have borrowed $522.1 million subject to interest rate risk.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S6	On this amount, each 1% increase in the LIBOR interest rate would result in $5.2 million of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis.
75679_16_ITEM7A_P1_S7	All of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) in 2013.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2015, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In our December 31, 2014 annual report on Form 10-K we reported that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to a material weakness associated with inadequately designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the calculation of our income tax expense during all quarters in 2014.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, we remediated our material weakness by strengthening the design and operation of our controls over the initial calculation and the review and approval of the calculation of our income tax expense.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	We reinforced to our staff that a heightened sense of awareness is needed during the initial preparation, as well as to any subsequent changes, and during analysis of the result.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	In our September 30, 2015 quarterly report on Form 10-Q we reported that we identified a misclassification error when we performed a classification review specific to the cash flow statement during the preparation of that Form 10-Q. Prior to the third quarter of 2015 we had a review process over significant and unusual transactions but this process did not specifically address the cash flow statement.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	During the fourth quarter of 2015 we remediated our material weakness by strengthening our internal controls over the preparation of the cash flow statement by including a review of cash flow statement classifications in our accounting memos on significant and unusual transactions.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	On February 2, 2015, we purchased ACS s wireless subscribers in the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	This transaction, which included assuming control of a new billing system, resulted in changes to our processes and procedures during 2015 but did not result in changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P9_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P10_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P10_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P10_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.
75679_16_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Items 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are omitted per General Instruction l(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K.

75679_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	General In this Annual Report, we, us, our, and the Company refer to GCI, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
75679_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 to effect the issuance of Senior Notes as further described in note 6 to the accompanying "Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this Report.

75679_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Also refer to Note 11 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
75679_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	General We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues.
75679_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	We provide a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, governmental entities, and educational and medical institutions primarily in Alaska under our GCI brand.
75679_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs.
75679_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Since GCI's founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets.
75679_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.
75679_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	In recent years, we expanded our efforts in wireless and presently operate the only statewide wireless network.
75679_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated consolidated revenues of $933.8 million .
75679_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	We ended the period with 222,500 wireless subscribers, 140,800 cable modem subscribers and 125,800 basic video subscribers.

75679_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	In August 2016, we sold to Vertical Bridge Towers II, LLC ("Vertical Bridge") 276 cell sites ("Tower Sites") in exchange for net proceeds of $90.8 million.
75679_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	We entered into a master lease agreement in which we lease back space at the Tower Sites for an initial term of ten years, followed by the option to renew for eight additional five year periods, for a total possible lease term of 50 years.
75679_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	Each lease is subject to a 2% annual increase in lease payments throughout the life of the initial lease and all subsequent lease renewals.

75679_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Universal Service Fund Alaska High Cost Order.
75679_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	On August 31, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") published a Report and Order to reform the methodology for distributing Universal Service Fund ("USF") high cost support for both wireline and wireless voice and broadband service ( Alaska High Cost Order ).
75679_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The Alaska High Cost Order was a significant program change that required a reassessment of our high cost support revenue recognition.
75679_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	See Note 1 included in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
75679_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	As a result of the Alaska High Cost Order, our 2016 high cost support revenue under the USF program was $2.5 million less than the $66.2 million of high cost support revenue recognized in 2015.
75679_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Additionally, we expect high cost support revenue under the USF program to be less than the 2015 level by approximately $5.0 million in each of 2017 and 2018, and $14.8 million annually from 2019 through 2026, the date the Alaska High Cost Order ends.
75679_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Business Regulation for additional regulatory developments.
75679_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We intend to continue to increase Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 11 in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," using the following strategies:
75679_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Expand Our Product Portfolio and Footprint in Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Throughout our history, we have successfully added and expect to continue to add new products to our product portfolio.
75679_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	We have a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for our customers, and we continue to assess revenue-enhancing opportunities that create value for our customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of our network coverage, we are currently pursuing or expect to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of our facilities, enhance our ability to serve our existing customers needs and attract new customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P14_S4	Additionally, due to the unique market conditions in Alaska, we, and in some cases our customers, participate in several federal (and to a lesser extent locally) subsidized programs designed to financially support the implementation and purchase of telecommunications services like ours in high cost areas.
75679_17_ITEM1_P14_S5	With these programs we have been able to expand our network into previously undeveloped areas of Alaska and, for the first time, offer comprehensive communications services in many rural parts of the state where we would not otherwise be able to construct facilities within appropriate return-on-investment requirements.
75679_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions of telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our management team will continue to actively pursue and make investments that we believe fit with our strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.
75679_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We sell new and enhanced services and products to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.
75679_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
75679_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	We have positioned ourselves as a customer service leader in the Alaska communications market.
75679_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We operate our own customer service department and have empowered our customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call.
75679_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	We prioritize our customer services to expedite handling of our most valuable customers issues, particularly for our largest commercial customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	We believe our integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows us to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
75679_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We continue to expand and evolve our integrated network for the delivery of our services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving our customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization.
75679_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	By offering multiple services, we are better able to leverage our network assets and increase returns on our invested capital.
75679_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	We periodically evaluate our network assets and continually monitor technological developments that we can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
75679_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Overview Our two reportable segments are Wireless and Wireline.
75679_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	The following discussion includes information about significant services and products, sales and marketing, facilities, competition and seasonality for each of our reportable segments.
75679_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	For a discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please see Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

75679_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 11 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Wireless segment.
75679_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Services and Products Our Wireless segment offers wholesale wireless services and products to wireless carriers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We provide network transport and access to our wireless network to wireless carriers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	These services allow wireless carriers to provide full wireless services to their customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Sales and Marketing Our Wireless segment sales and marketing efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of wireless carriers we serve and the number of voice and data circuits leased.
75679_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We sell our wireless services primarily through direct contact marketing.
75679_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Facilities We own and operate a statewide network providing voice and data services to the urban and rural communities of Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our statewide wireless network provides 4G LTE data service, EVDO, 3G UMTS/HSPA+, 2G CDMA, and 2G GSM/EDGE service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We own and operate Wi-Fi access points that create a Wi-Fi network branded as TurboZone in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kenai-Soldotna, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other areas of the State ("TurboZone").
75679_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Competition Our Wireless segment competes with AT T, Verizon, and smaller companies.
75679_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	We compete in the wholesale wireless market by offering competitive rates and by providing a comprehensive statewide network to meet the needs of carrier customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Seasonality Our Wireless segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow, and short daylight hours.
75679_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Major Customer The Wireless segment had no major customer in 2016.
75679_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Verizon was the only major customer of the Wireless segment in 2015 and 2014.
75679_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Wireline Segment Wireline segment revenues for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	1 See Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 11 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the financial performance of our Wireline segment.
75679_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Services and Products Our Wireline segment offers services and products to two major customer groups as follows:
75679_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Consumer - We offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video, and voice services to residential customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	We offer a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to businesses, governmental entities, and educational institutions and wholesale data and voice services to common carrier customers and regulated voice services to residential and commercial customers in rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Sales and Marketing We offer our services directly to consumer and business customers through our call center, direct mail advertising, television advertising, Internet advertising, local media advertising, and through our retail stores.
75679_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve, selling bundled services, and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities.
75679_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	We sell our managed services, wholesale data and voice services, and data services to rural schools and health organizations through direct contact marketing.
75679_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Facilities We operate a modern, competitive communications network providing switched and dedicated voice and broadband services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our fiber network employs digital transmission technology over our fiber optic facilities within Alaska and between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
75679_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	We serve many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications.
75679_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Each of our satellite transponders is backed up on alternate spacecraft with multiple backup transponders.
75679_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	We operate a hybrid fiber optic cable and digital microwave system ( TERRA ) linking Anchorage with the Bristol Bay, Yukon-Kuskokwim, and northwest regions of the state.
75679_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our video businesses are located throughout Alaska and serve the majority of the population.
75679_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our facilities include hybrid-fiber-coax plant and head-end distribution equipment.
75679_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	The majority of our locations on the fiber routes are served from head-end distribution equipment in Anchorage.
75679_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	All of our cable systems are completely digital.
75679_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol data services are delivered to an Ethernet port located at the service end-point.
75679_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our management platform continuously monitors the network and service end-points for performance.
75679_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.
75679_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	The management platform has the capability to remotely access network elements and service end-points, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service end-point.
75679_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	This management platform allows us to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
75679_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Competition We operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment, and information products and services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior.
75679_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition We compete with AT T, Verizon, and other community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.
75679_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	The national wireless carriers with whom we compete, AT T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than ours.
75679_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.
75679_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, bundled services, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, statewide network coverage and capacity, TurboZone, the type of wireless handsets offered, and the availability of differentiated features and services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	Competition is based upon price and pricing plans, service bundles, the types of services offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	We compete with other providers some of which are headquartered outside of Alaska and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
75679_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems.
75679_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone.
75679_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
75679_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our video systems face competition from services and devices that offer distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, using alternative methods such as Internet video streaming and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS").
75679_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems.
75679_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Internet video streaming is a major source of competition for our video services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Additionally, some online video services are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content.
75679_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	The DBS industry is another major source of competition for our video services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Two major companies, AT T-owned DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering high-power DBS services in Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Competitive forces may be counteracted by offering subscribers expanded programming.
75679_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have retransmission agreements with various broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into certain of our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	Additionally, our ownership of television stations provides us the opportunity to create unique content for our subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.
75679_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
75679_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Voice Services and Products Competition Our most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	also compete against Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"), long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance.
75679_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have competed by offering what we believe is excellent customer service and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Seasonality Our Wireline segment services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Major Customer We had no Wireline segment major customers in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
75679_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Sales and Marketing Company-wide Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, data and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and managed services expenditures, and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Environmental Regulations We undertake activities that may, under certain circumstances, affect the environment.
75679_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Accordingly, they may be subject to federal, state, and local laws designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
75679_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	The FCC, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and National Historic Preservation Act to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
75679_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon.
75679_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	We obtain federal, state, and local permits, as required, for our projects and operations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	We are unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
75679_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses We do not hold patents, franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	We hold a number of federally registered service marks used by our reportable segments.
75679_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	We hold licenses for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services provided by our Wireline segment.
75679_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	We hold various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use.
75679_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	These licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_17_ITEM1_P66_S3	However, we expect these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
75679_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	We hold licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years.
75679_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide local, long distance, and video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area.
75679_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	Regulation Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Wireless Services and Products General .
75679_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	As wireless licensees, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
75679_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, modification, and registration of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas.
75679_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	The High Cost Program of the USF pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P73_S3	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order.
75679_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	Per the Alaska High Cost Order, as of January 1, 2017, Remote high cost support payments to Alaska High Cost participants was frozen on a per-company basis at adjusted December 2014 levels for a ten-year term in exchange for meeting individualized performance obligations to offer voice and broadband services meeting the service obligations at specified minimum speeds by five-year and ten-year service milestones to a specified number of locations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	Remote high cost support is no longer dependent upon line counts and line count filings are no longer required.
75679_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Prior to the Alaska High Cost Order, Urban high cost support payments were frozen and had phased down to 60% of the monthly average of the 2011 annual support.
75679_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	The Alaska High Cost Order mandates that as of January 1, 2017, Urban high cost support for 2017 and 2018 will be two-thirds and one-third of the December 2014 level of support received, respectively, with Urban high cost support ending effective December 31, 2018.
75679_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	On April 27, 2016, the FCC released a Third Report and Order to reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program ("Lifeline Order").
75679_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	The Lifeline Order adopted several reforms, including incentivizing and sometimes requiring broadband providers to offer fixed and/or mobile broadband service to Lifeline subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	The Lifeline Order also limited the number of federal programs that confer Lifeline eligibility, and made small changes to the requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	Failure to correctly judge eligibility and recertify Lifeline subscribers could materially adversely affect our Lifeline revenues and/or increase our costs in the form of FCC fines for failure to comply with Lifeline rules.
75679_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	We have completed negotiations and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks for more information.
75679_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s phone number and approximate location.
75679_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	Due to Alaska s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.
75679_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC s standard.
75679_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	The FCC also imposed requirements to allow users to text-to-911 if the local public safety dispatch agency requests and is able to receive such texts.
75679_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	We have developed a text-to-911 technical solution and have certified to the FCC that we are now capable of meeting the FCC requirements.
75679_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P86_S3	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_17_ITEM1_P86_S4	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P86_S5	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to customers and result in higher costs to customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	Pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012, state and local governments are further constrained in their regulation of changes to existing wireless infrastructure.
75679_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new antenna structures has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	Data Services and Products General .
75679_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the global operation of the Internet.
75679_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_17_ITEM1_P91_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	The vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_17_ITEM1_P92_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect our costs and the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	This order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic.
75679_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	These rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P95_S3	The order refrains from applying rate regulation and tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P95_S4	While we do not believe that the FCC order conflicts with our existing practices or offerings, the order will impose regulatory burdens, likely increase our costs, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	On December 12, 2012, the FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund to supplement the existing Telecommunications Program of the Rural Health Care ( RHC ) Program of the USF.
75679_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	Healthcare providers can choose to participate under the existing Telecommunications Program and/or the new Healthcare Connect Fund.
75679_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	On January 13, 2017, USAC announced that current projections for the funding year ending June 30, 2017 show that the total dollar value of all qualifying funding requests will for the first time either meet or exceed the program s $400 million annual cap.
75679_17_ITEM1_P96_S3	We cannot predict the impact of this change at this time.
75679_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	On July 11 and December 11, 2014, the FCC adopted orders modernizing the USF Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate").
75679_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	These orders, among other things, increased the annual E-Rate cap by approximately $1.5 billion, designated funds for internal connections within schools and libraries, and eliminated funding for certain legacy services, such as voice, to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide.
75679_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	These orders did not have a material effect on the overall E-Rate support available to our schools and libraries customers, and therefore did not materially affect our revenue from such customers.
75679_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P99_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	The RCA previously regulated the basic service tier on our video system in Juneau.
75679_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	On June 3, 2015, the FCC adopted a rebuttable presumption that cable providers are subject to Effective Competition, and the RCA did not rebut that presumption by the filing deadline set by the new rules.
75679_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	Because the RCA did not rebut the presumption, we can now unwind our informational tariff in Juneau, with proper customer notice under the FCC rules, and apply our statewide basic service tier pricing in Juneau.
75679_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	The RCA does not regulate rates for cable modem service.
75679_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_17_ITEM1_P104_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_17_ITEM1_P104_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_17_ITEM1_P104_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_17_ITEM1_P104_S5	In addition, on April 7, 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services, and on November 17, 2015, took further steps to bring telecommunications and cable pole attachment rates into parity.
75679_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	Though the general purpose of the rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.
75679_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	In addition, because the RCA has adopted its own formula, the FCC s reclassification of broadband service as a telecommunications service is not anticipated to have any near-term impact.
75679_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	the RCA changing its formula, adopting the federal formula, or relinquishing its oversight of pole attachments to the FCC, any of which could increase the cost of our operations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_17_ITEM1_P107_S2	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_17_ITEM1_P107_S3	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.
75679_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	Wireline Voice Services and Products General.
75679_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P110_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P110_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1_P111_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_17_ITEM1_P111_S3	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service for information on USF reform.
75679_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except ACS in its Anchorage study area.
75679_17_ITEM1_P113_S1	We participated in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_17_ITEM1_P113_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Wireline Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_17_ITEM1_P117_S1	On November 29, 2011, the FCC released rules to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_17_ITEM1_P117_S2	The details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_17_ITEM1_P117_S3	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our operations.
75679_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_17_ITEM1_P118_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be changed in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rule modifications that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_17_ITEM1_P118_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_17_ITEM1_P118_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_17_ITEM1_P119_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_17_ITEM1_P119_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_17_ITEM1_P120_S0	The Communications Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_17_ITEM1_P121_S0	Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks.
75679_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	On January 30, 2014, the FCC adopted an order calling for experiments to examine how best to accelerate the technological and regulatory transitions from traditional TDM-based networks to IP-based technologies.
75679_17_ITEM1_P121_S2	Although no entity has proposed conducting a technology transition experiment in our service territory in response to the FCC s January 2014 order, additional proposals for experiments are possible.
75679_17_ITEM1_P121_S3	We cannot predict whether additional proposals for experiments might be submitted to the FCC nor any resulting proceedings or their effect on us.
75679_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	The FCC also has other open dockets through which it might make changes to the regulatory regime applicable to IP-based networks.
75679_17_ITEM1_P122_S1	A change in regulatory obligation or classification that interferes with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
75679_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	We do not have significant foreign operations or export sales.
75679_17_ITEM1_P123_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	Company-Sponsored Research We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	Employees We employed 2,310 persons as of December 31, 2016, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_17_ITEM1_P125_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	Other No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We face increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our wholesale customers including our major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they contract with us to use our network to provide service on their behalf.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We would experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of our wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is provided on our network.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than we do.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We expect to continue to offer competitive alternatives to such customers in order to retain significant traffic on our network.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We cannot predict whether such negotiations will be successful.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our inability to negotiate such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled Competition included in Part 1 Item 1 Business Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers perceptions of our services, and customer care quality.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Managing these factors and subscribers expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Some of our competitors have national networks which enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Although the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While we believe that we are currently in compliance with such FCC rules, the failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The FCC requires local notice in any community in which it is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	This rule could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The order also strengthens transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The new rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The order refrains from imposing rate regulation or tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply its new rules.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, although the FCC forbore from many of the provisions of Title II, we cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply the statutory provisions and regulations from which it did not forbear.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	It is possible that the FCC could interpret or apply its new rules or Title II statutory provisions or regulations in a way that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There also is a risk class action lawsuits arising under the provisions of Title II from which the FCC did not forbear could have similar negative impacts.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Proposals have been made before Congress to mandate Open Internet regulation that could supplement or supplant in whole or part the FCC s new rules.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We currently cannot predict whether any such legislation will be adopted nor what impacts are most likely.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact on the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to unbundled network elements.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Part 1 Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	This support was 24% , 19% , and 19% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We had USF net receivables of $92.0 million and $98.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	See Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireless Services and Products Universal Service and Description of Our Business by Reportable Segment Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may not meet our performance plan milestones under the Alaska High Cost Order.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	As an ETC, we receive support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which requires us to submit to the FCC a performance plan with five-year and ten-year commitments.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we are unable to meet the final performance plan milestones approved by the FCC we will be required to repay 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received over the ten-year term for the relevant number of locations that we failed to deploy to, plus ten percent of our total Alaska High Cost Order support received over the ten-year term.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Inability to meet our performance plan milestones could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may lose USF high cost support if another carrier adds 4G LTE service in an area where we currently provide 4G LTE service.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	support levels in the second half of the ten-year term.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As a result, if another carrier builds 4G LTE service in an area where we are the sole provider and the FCC decides to redistribute the support then our high cost support may be reduced which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The decline in our Wireline segment voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We expect our Wireline voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenues will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") program for funding our TERRA-NW project.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In 2011 and 2012 we entered into three separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA-NW project.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which were restricted for use on TERRA-NW.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $56.0 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in December 2019.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Failure to complete testing and deployment of a new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Successful implementation of new technologies and support systems depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We may not successfully complete the rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska and is impacted by the economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We offer products and services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Prolonged periods of low oil prices will adversely impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Oil prices have continued to remain low which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues come from the oil industry.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of declining oil prices.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	The State of Alaska failed to pass a workable long-term fiscal plan during the 2016 legislative session.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P52_S5	As a result, we plan to reduce our 2017 Alaska capital expenditure budget by 20% to 25% of the 2016 target of $210.0 million due substantially to the continued uncertainty of the ability of the State of Alaska to adopt and implement a workable long-term fiscal plan.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Alaska economy is officially in a recession.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If the recession continues, it could negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	While it is difficult for us to predict the impact of the recession on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P53_S5	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Additionally, the customer base in Alaska is limited and we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We may not be able to continue to increase our share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Natural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that our technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Additionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Cyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Cyberattacks against our technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of our operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to our customers, our assets, and our reputation.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	To date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Nevertheless, we engage in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to us, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard our infrastructure and confidential customer information.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat detection, and URL filtering.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Despite these preventive and detective actions, our efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Some of the most significant risks to our information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:
75679_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of our vendors and other providers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	If hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer data.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	A network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, litigation, fines, and sanctions, lost revenues from business interruption, and damage to the public s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P66_S2	As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Increases in data usage on our wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Video streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	As use of these newer services continues to grow, our customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on our wireless network.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	constraints may preclude us from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Prolonged service interruptions or system failures could affect our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We are able to deliver services and serve our customers only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Disruption to our billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P71_S6	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA facilities and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Our facilities also include TERRA and its extensions which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or of our unringed TERRA facility and its extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are in the process of transferring our customer billing systems to a new third-party vendor.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects on our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S2	We are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves moving to a new third-party billing services vendor and platform in 2018.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S3	The implementation may cause major system or business disruptions or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S4	In addition, the third-party billing services vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S5	Interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, or attract new customers, and negatively impact overall customer experience.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P84_S6	Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our significant debt and lease obligations could adversely affect our business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and lease obligations including capital, operating, and the tower obligation (see Note 2 included in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information).
75679_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Our high level of debt and lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P91_S4	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P91_S5	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	The terms of our debt obligations impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the debt obligations.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P94_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P94_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P94_S5	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace one or both.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P96_S1	If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow could decrease.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Any significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our broadcast licenses represent permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P103_S2	If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, in the period in which the determination is made.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P103_S3	The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P103_S4	These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P103_S5	Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	GCI, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax returns as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	At December 31, 2016, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $268.0 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	If GCI experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when its market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P106_S2	This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Concerns about health/safety risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We do not manufacture devices or other equipment sold by us, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P108_S2	However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P108_S3	We cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P109_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P109_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P109_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P109_S5	However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	A significant percentage of GCI's voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	As of December 31, 2016, GCI's executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 16% of its combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 25% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_17_ITEM1A_P112_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI's Board.
75679_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease most of our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our Wireline and Wireless segments have properties that consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.

75679_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	Substantial amounts of our properties are located on or in leased real property or facilities.
75679_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	Substantially all of our properties secure our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	See Note 7 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Information for Common Stock All issued and outstanding shares of GCI, Inc's Class A common stock are held by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	GCI's Class A and Class B common stock are publicly traded.
75679_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Dividends GCI and GCI, Inc. have never paid cash dividends on GCI's common stock, and we have no present intention of doing so.
75679_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	Payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be determined by GCI's Board of Directors in light of our earnings, financial condition and other relevant considerations.
75679_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	Our existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit payment of dividends on common stock, other than stock dividends (see Note 7 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information).
75679_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Stock Transfer Agent and Registrar Computershare is GCI's stock transfer agent and registrar.
75679_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	1 Total assets and long-term debt, including current portion and net of unamortized discount and deferred loan fees have been recast as if we had adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 as of December 31, 2012.
75679_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	See Note 1 included in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information on ASU 2015-03.
75679_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	The Selected Financial Data should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
75679_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
75679_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
75679_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in Note 1 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of of this annual report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
75679_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
75679_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	See also our Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	GCI, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Alaska in 1997 to affect the issuance of Senior Notes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	GCI, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GCI, received through its initial capitalization all ownership interests in subsidiaries previously held by GCI.
75679_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Shares of GCI s Class A common stock are traded on the Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol of GNCMA.
75679_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Shares of GCI s Class B common stock are traded on the OTCQX market.
75679_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Shares of GCI, Inc. s common stock are wholly owned by GCI and are not publicly traded.
75679_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	The GCI and GCI, Inc. consolidated financial statements include substantially the same account activity.
75679_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Emerging Growth Company We qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act ) enacted on April 5, 2012.
75679_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.
75679_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
75679_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
75679_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.
75679_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
75679_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Update on Economic Conditions We offer wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Prolonged periods of low oil prices will adversely impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Oil prices have continued to remain low which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues come from the oil industry.
75679_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of declining oil prices.
75679_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The State of Alaska failed to pass a workable long-term fiscal plan during the 2016 legislative session.
75679_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	As a result, we plan to reduce our 2017 Alaska capital expenditure budget by 20% to 25% of the 2016 target of $210.0 million due substantially to the continued uncertainty of the ability of the State of Alaska to adopt and implement a workable long-term fiscal plan.
75679_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Alaska economy is officially in a recession.
75679_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	If the recession continues, it could negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	While it is difficult for us to predict the impact of the recession on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline.
75679_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_17_ITEM7_P9_S5	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	General Overview Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 11 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K. We have historically met our cash needs for operations, regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Major Developments In the third quarter of 2016, we received $90.8 million for the initial closing to sell the majority of our urban wireless rooftop and tower sites to Vertical Bridge ("Tower Transaction").
75679_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	Additionally, we entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Vertical Bridge to lease collocation space on communications towers and facilities that were sold to Vertical Bridge.
75679_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	In December 2012, the FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund to supplement the existing Telecommunications Program of the RHC Program of the USF.
75679_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Healthcare providers can choose to participate under the existing Telecommunications Program and/or the new Healthcare Connect Fund.
75679_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	In January 2017, USAC announced that current projections for the funding year ending June 30, 2017 show that the total dollar value of all qualifying funding requests will for the first time either meet or exceed the program s $400 million annual cap.
75679_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	We cannot predict the impact of this change at this time.
75679_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	In August 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which was a significant program change that required a reassessment of our high cost support revenue recognition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	See Note 1 in "Part I - Item 1 - Condensed Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information.
75679_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	As a result of the Alaska High Cost Order, our 2016 high cost support revenue under the USF program was $2.5 million less than the $66.2 million of high cost support revenue recognized in 2015.
75679_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Additionally, we expect high cost support revenue under the USF program to be less than the 2015 level by approximately $5.0 million in each of 2017 and 2018, and $14.8 million annually from 2019 through 2026, the date the Alaska High Cost Order ends.
75679_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	In February 2015, we purchased ACS' interest in The Alaska Wireless Network, LLC ("AWN") and substantially all the assets of ACS and its affiliates related to ACS s wireless operations ( Acquired ACS Assets ) (collectively the "Wireless Acquisition").
75679_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, we transfered to ACS a cash payment of $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and agreed to terminate or amend certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Acquired ACS Assets include substantially all of ACS s wireless subscriber assets, including subscriber contracts, and certain of ACS s CDMA network assets, including fiber strands and associated cell site electronics and microwave facilities and associated electronics.
75679_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	We assumed from ACS post-closing liabilities of ACS and its affiliates under contracts assumed by us and liabilities with respect to the ownership by ACS of its equity interest in AWN to the extent accruing and related to the period after closing.
75679_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	All other liabilities were retained by ACS and its affiliates.
75679_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	Following the close of the Wireless Acquisition, AWN is a wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	We funded the purchase with a $275.0 million Term Loan B under our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI.
75679_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (underlying data rounded to the nearest thousand):
75679_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings plus imputed interest on financed devices before: Net interest expense, Income taxes, Depreciation and amortization expense, Loss on extinguishment of debt, Software impairment charge, Share-based compensation expense, Accretion expense, Loss attributable to non-controlling interest resulting from NMTC transactions, Gains and impairment losses on equity and cost method investments, Gain recorded for adjusting to fair value assets that were included as consideration paid to acquire a fiber system, and Other non-cash adjustments.
75679_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in understanding and evaluating operating performance as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures.
75679_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	In addition, multiples of current or projected Adjusted EBITDA are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value.
75679_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Overview of Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold Total revenue, cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense)("Cost of Goods Sold"), and Adjusted EBITDA for 2016, 2015, and 2014 are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	See the discussion below for more information by segment.
75679_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	See Note 11 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Wireless segment was impacted by the Wireless Acquisition discussed above in the General Overview section.
75679_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	During 2014 and to the close of the Wireless Acquisition on February 2, 2015, AWN provided wholesale services to GCI and ACS and roaming services to other wireless carriers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	During that time, AWN received a portion of revenue from GCI and ACS' retail wireless customers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	Additionally, AWN paid an incentive to GCI and ACS for the sale of wireless handsets to their respective retail customers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	Following the close of the Wireless Acquisition, the Wireless segment continues to provide roaming services to other wireless carriers and provides wholesale services to the Wireline segment for which it receives a portion of revenue from wireless retail customers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P25_S5	Additionally, the Wireless segment started recording a portion of the wireless equipment costs to encourage the Wireline segment to transition customers from our CDMA network to our GSM network.
75679_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Wireless segment revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	See Note 11 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The decrease in revenue for 2016 is primarily due to the following:
75679_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	a $15.9 million or 19% decrease in plan fee revenue primarily due to a decrease in subscribers and discounts given to customers who finance or bring their own device.
75679_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The decrease in revenue for 2015 is primarily due to a $26.2 million or 24% decrease in plan fee revenue due to our transition to a fixed percentage allocation of plan fee revenue from the Wireline segment following the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The decrease is partially offset by the following:
75679_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	A $8.6 million or 95% decrease in the contra-revenue wireless handset cash incentives to ACS for the sale of wireless handsets to their retail customers prior to the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold The decrease in Cost of Goods Sold for 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to the following:
75679_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	A $7.7 million or 100% and $9.6 million or 55% decrease in wireless equipment costs for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Wireless segment gave a wireless equipment subsidy to the Wireline segment in accordance with the AWN agreements in 2014.
75679_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	This subsidy was discontinued following the February 2, 2015 close of of the Wireless Acquisition, but the Wireless segment started recording a portion of the wireless equipment costs to encourage the Wireline segment to transition customers from our CDMA network to our GSM network which partially offset the decrease.
75679_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	A $4.8 million or 23% decrease in distribution and capacity costs for 2015 primarily because we were able to extend an agreement with a vendor which resulted in the resolution of certain issues and the release of the related reserve and a reduction in capacity costs and costs to terminate long distance traffic.
75679_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The decrease for 2016 was partially offset by the absence of the reserve that was released in 2015.
75679_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	The decrease in Cost of Goods Sold for 2016 and 2015 is partially offset by the following:
75679_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	A $4.2 million or 17% increase in network maintenance costs in 2015 primarily due to the the expansion of our network and an increase in the utility and operating costs.
75679_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	We primarily control our roaming costs through multi-year contracts with our roaming partners that allow our retail wireless customers to roam on their networks.
75679_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 is primarily due to decreased revenue as described above in Wireless Segment Revenues.
75679_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	These decreases were partially offset by decreased Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 is primarily due to decreases in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireless Segment Cost of Goods Sold" and selling, general and administrative expense partially offset by a decrease in revenue as described above in Wireless Segment Revenues.
75679_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Wireline Segment Overview Please see "Part I - Item 1.
75679_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Business - Description of our Business by Reportable Segment - Overview" for a description of our Wireline segment services and products by major customer group.
75679_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	The components of Wireline segment revenue are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	See Note 11 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selected key performance indicators for our Wireline segment follow:
75679_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	4 A high-definition/digital video recorder ("HD/DVR") converter box is defined as one box rented by a digital programming or basic tier subscriber.
75679_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	A digital programming or basic tier subscriber is not required to rent an HD/DVR converter box to receive service.
75679_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	5 Applicable average monthly video revenues divided by the average number of basic subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2016, 2015, and 2014.
75679_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	6 A local access line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network.
75679_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	A Lifeline wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device that is eligible for Lifeline support.

75679_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	8 A prepaid wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device where service is purchased in advance of use.
75679_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The purchased credit is used to pay for wireless services at the point the service is accessed or consumed.
75679_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	9 A postpaid wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device where service is provided by a prior arrangement with a subscriber and the subscriber is billed after the fact according to their use of wireless services at the end of each month.
75679_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	10 Average monthly wireless revenues, excluding those from common carrier customers, divided by the average of wireless subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2016 and 2014.
75679_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Average monthly wireless revenues, excluding those from common carrier customers, divided by the number of wireless subscribers at the end of each month for each of the months in 2015.
75679_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	This calculation includes applicable revenue from the Wireline segment - Consumer - Wireless and Wireline segment - Business Services - Wireless and wholesale wireless revenues earned from GCI retail subscribers included in the Wireless segment.
75679_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	11 Applicable average monthly cable modem revenues divided by the average number of subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in 2016, 2015, and 2014.
75679_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Consumer The items contributing to the decrease in wireless revenue for 2016 include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	A $2.4 million or 7% decrease in equipment sales revenue due to a decrease in the number of wireless devices sold.
75679_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The decrease in equipment sales revenue was partially offset by a $4.1 million adjustment to lower the guarantee liability for our Upgrade Now program (please see Note 1 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on the guarantee liability) that was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.
75679_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Based on a review of historical information, we determined that our customers were not trading their devices in as early and frequently as originally estimated.
75679_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Additionally, we found that we were able to resell the used handsets for prices higher than originally estimated.
75679_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Based on this new information, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the guarantee liability recorded for financed devices in our Upgrade Now program.
75679_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	The items contributing to the increase in wireless revenue for 2015 include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	A $14.7 million or 548% increase in plan fee revenue primarily due to the acquisition of ACS' wireless subscribers following the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	A $27.2 million or 446% increase in equipment sales revenue due to an increase in the number of financed devices.
75679_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	In late 2014, we began encouraging our customers to purchase wireless devices through our financing program instead of subsidizing their device purchases.
75679_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	We offer a discount on the monthly plan fee for customers who choose to finance their device rather than buying a subsidized device.
75679_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	The transition from subsidized devices to more financed devices will result in higher revenues when a contract is signed and a decrease in the monthly Wireless ARPU going forward.
75679_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The increase in data revenue is primarily due to a $12.8 million or 11% and $20.3 million or 20% increase in cable modem revenue for 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to an increase in the average number of subscribers and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds and higher usage limits in 2016 and 2015.
75679_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Consumer video revenue faces challenges as more customers choose to have their video content delivered via the Internet.
75679_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, this selection may result in additional data service revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	We expect Consumer voice revenue to continue to decrease due to a growing number of customers using wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local and long distance calling.
75679_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Business Services Business Services data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.
75679_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	This revenue faces challenges due to the continued decline of oil prices which negatively impacts certain of our customers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Additionally, we face rate compression for data transport and storage services.
75679_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	As discussed above in the General Overview section, USAC announced that current projections for the funding year ending June 30, 2017 show that the total dollar value of all qualifying funding requests will for the first time either meet or exceed the program s $400 million annual cap.
75679_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this change but we do not expect it to have an immediate material adverse impact on our operations.
75679_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The increase in data revenue in 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to a $32.4 million or 15% and $20.5 million or 10.3% increase, respectively, in data transport and storage revenue due to new customers and increased purchases by our existing customers partially offset by decreases due to rate compression.
75679_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in data revenue was partially offset by a $5.3 million or 11% and $1.3 million or 3% decrease in time and materials revenue due to a decrease in special project work for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Advertising is the primary driver for video revenue, therefore, we can see large variations in revenue due to the election cycle or other major televised events such as the Olympics.
75679_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The variations may be more extreme in years when there are highly contested political elections or ballot initiatives.
75679_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	The $14.4 million or 43% decrease in video revenue in 2015 is primarily due to a decrease in advertising after the completion of the highly contested political elections in 2014.
75679_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Business Services voice revenue continues to face competition and rate compression and to a lesser extent the substitution of wireless devices.
75679_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Wireline Segment Cost of Goods Sold The individually significant items contributing to the 2016 decrease in Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	A 11% or $3.3 million decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to a decrease in minutes and the movement of more traffic to our own facilities.
75679_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The individually significant items contributing to the 2015 increase in Wireline segment Cost of Goods Sold include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	A 82% or $22.5 million increase in wireless device Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to an increase in the number of handsets sold and and a change in the allocation between the Wireline and Wireless segments following the February 2, 2015 close of the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	The Wireline segment received a wireless equipment subsidy from the Wireless segment in accordance with the AWN agreements during 2014.
75679_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	A 8% or $5.5 million increase in video Cost of Goods Sold primarily due to increased rates paid to programmers partially offset by a decrease in basic video subscribers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	We expect to face continued increases in programming costs that may require us to drop certain channels or increase the rates paid by our customers that may result in a loss of additional video customers.
75679_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 is primarily due to an increase in revenues as described above in "Wireline Segment Revenues" and a decrease in Cost of Goods Sold as described above in "Wireline Segment Cost of Goods Sold" partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expense.
75679_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Individually significant items contributing to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	A $2.3 million increase in inventory adjustments for 2015 primarily due to the write-off of obsolete wireless handsets.
75679_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The increases discussed above for 2016 are partially offset by the following items:
75679_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The absence of $2.9 million for liquidated damages accrued for a contract in 2015.
75679_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 38% , 35% , and 32% of revenue for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	The 2016 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as percentage of total revenues is primarily due to increases in labor and contract labor costs without corresponding increases in revenue due to spending on our billing system conversion.
75679_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	The 2015 increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to the costs related to the acquisition of ACS' wireless subscribers and its non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	The increases in 2016 and 2015 are primarily due to new assets placed in service in those years partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during those years.
75679_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Software Impairment Charge Software impairment charge decreased $29.8 million in 2016 primarily due to the absence of an impairment charge recorded in 2015 as discussed below.
75679_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we internally developed computer software to replace our wireless, Internet, video, local service, and long distance customer billing systems.
75679_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	During the first quarter of 2015, we completed a detailed assessment of our progress to date and determined it was no longer probable that the computer software being developed would be completed and placed in service.
75679_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	Our assessment concluded that the cost of continuing the development would be much higher than originally estimated, and the timing and scope risks were substantial.
75679_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	We identified development work, hardware, and software recorded as Construction in Progress through the first quarter of 2015, that may be applicable to our replacement customer billing solution, future internally developed software, and other system needs and therefore should remain capital assets.
75679_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	We considered the remaining capital expenditures for this billing system to have a fair value of $0 and recorded an impairment charge of $20.7 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
75679_17_ITEM7_P81_S5	We have signed a contract with an established billing solution provider and have begun the multi-year implementation.
75679_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	During the first quarter of 2015, we reassessed our plans for our internally developed machine-to-machine billing system and decided to no longer market this system to third parties.
75679_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	Accordingly we recognized an impairment of $7.1 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
75679_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, we evaluated user management software we purchased in 2014 and determined that we would not be able to use the software.
75679_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	Accordingly we recognized an impairment of $1.0 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
75679_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of other income, follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Items contributing to the decrease in 2016 include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Items contributing to the increase in 2015 include:
75679_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	A $2.6 million net loss for adjusting to fair value the assets included in the consideration transfered in the Wireless Acquisition and adjusting to fair value amendments to certain agreements related to the right to use ACS network assets.
75679_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Income Tax Expense GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Income tax expense totaled $7.1 million , $0.1 million , and $10.0 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	Our effective income tax rate was 131% , (1)% , and 14% in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	Our effective tax rate is impacted by the the amount of permanent differences as compared to our net income (loss) before income taxes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our 2014 effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN in income before income taxes and the exclusion of income taxes on income attributable to the non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	We completed the Wireless Acquisition on February 2, 2015, after which ACS no longer has a non-controlling interest in AWN.
75679_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	At December 31, 2016, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $268.0 million that will begin expiring in 2022 if not utilized, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.7 million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years.
75679_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $109.6 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2002 to 2015 and that expire from 2022 to 2035, respectively, and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in 2004 through 2009, 2011, and 2012 and that expire in 2024 through 2029, 2031, and 2032, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be 53% to 58% in the year ending December 31, 2017.
75679_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	The effective tax rate is expected to be much higher due to an increase in the pretax book income amount and the relative impact that the expected tax adjustments have on that pretax income amount.
75679_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2016, we amended our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	The amended Senior Credit Facility provides a $215.0 million Term Loan A, a $245.9 million Term Loan B, and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, with a $50.0 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit.
75679_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	The borrowings under the Term Loan A and revolving credit facility are scheduled to mature on November 17, 2021, and the Term Loan B is scheduled to mature on February 2, 2022; provided that, if the 2021 Senior Notes are not refinanced by December 3, 2020, then all of the loans under the Senior Credit Facility become due on such date.
75679_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	We paid $4.1 million in fees associated with the amendment.
75679_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	As discussed above in the General Overview section, in the third quarter of 2016 we received $90.8 million for the Tower Transaction.
75679_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	In the first quarter of 2016, we entered into new long-term roaming and backhaul agreements with our largest roaming partners.
75679_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	The revenue recognized for these contracts was determined by calculating the cumulative minimum cash payments and recognizing the amount evenly over the life of the contracts.
75679_17_ITEM7_P97_S2	In the early years of the contracts, the cash received is in excess of the revenue recognized resulting in a significant increase in long-term deferred revenue; in the later years the cash received will be less than the revenue recognized and will lower long-term deferred revenue.
75679_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition to purchase ACS' wireless subscriber base and its one-third ownership interest in AWN for $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and the termination or amendment of certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Following the close of the transaction, AWN is our wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	We used proceeds from our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI to fund the purchase from ACS.
75679_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	In the second quarter of 2015, we closed on the issuance of $450.0 million of new 6.875% Senior Notes due 2025 ("2025 Notes") at an issue price of 99.105%.
75679_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	The net proceeds of the offering were used to retire our existing 2019 Notes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	We paid closing costs totaling $7.9 million in connection with the offering, which were recorded as deferred loan costs and will be amortized over the term of the 2025 Notes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P99_S3	We recorded a $27.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2015.
75679_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures.
75679_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_17_ITEM7_P102_S2	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $194.5 million and $176.2 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
75679_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	Depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2017, we expect our 2017 capital expenditures to total approximately $165.0 million.
75679_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	This estimate is based on purchases in 2017 regardless of the timing of cash payments.
75679_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 consists primarily of cash received from the Tower Transaction partially offset by repurchases of GCI's stock, payments on our Senior Credit Facility, net of borrowings, and costs paid for the amendment to our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 consists primarily of our payment to complete the Wireless Acquisition, costs paid to retire our 2019 Notes, costs paid for the 2025 Notes, and repurchases of GCI's stock partially offset by borrowings on our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI to fund the Wireless Acquisition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Our borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_17_ITEM7_P104_S3	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI's common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	We had a $55.0 million outstanding balance and $21.0 million in letters of credit under the $200.0 million Senior Credit Facility Revolver at December 31, 2016 , which leaves $124.0 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2016 .
75679_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Debt Covenants We are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ), our 2025 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Share Repurchases GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI Class A and Class B common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock.
75679_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	Under this program, GCI is currently authorized to make up to $60.3 million of repurchases as of December 31, 2016.
75679_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	GCI is authorized to increase its repurchase limit $5.0 million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares.
75679_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	If stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases.
75679_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	During 2016 we repurchased, on GCI's behalf, 3.5 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $55.2 million.
75679_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	The common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage, liquidity, company performance, and market conditions and subject to continued oversight by GCI s Board of Directors.
75679_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	The open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 10b-18.
75679_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (amounts in thousands):
75679_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our 2021 and 2025 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and the Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	Interest on the amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo note payable are based on variable rates.
75679_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	We used the current rate paid on our Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments.
75679_17_ITEM7_P111_S3	Our 2021 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.0 million through June 2021 and our 2025 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $15.5 million through April 2025.
75679_17_ITEM7_P111_S4	For a discussion of our long-term debt see Note 7 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	Capital lease obligations consist primarily of our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see Note 14 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	Tower obligations consist of our obligation to Vertical Bridge for the Master Lease Agreement that we entered into as part of the Tower Transaction.
75679_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations, which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2016.
75679_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose and off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for recently issued accounting pronouncements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	Our financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI's Audit Committee.
75679_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2016 are described below.
75679_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	We record expense to maintain an allowance for doubtful receivabless for estimated losses that result from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	When determining the allowance, we consider the probability of recoverability based on past experience, economic data, and changes in our collections processes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P121_S2	Credit risks are assessed based on historical write-offs, net of recoveries, as well as an analysis of the aged accounts and installment receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages.
75679_17_ITEM7_P121_S3	Accounts receivable may be fully reserved when specific collection issues are known to exist, such as pending bankruptcy or catastrophes.
75679_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	Impairment and Useful Lives of Intangible Assets We had $526.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2016, consisting of goodwill of $239.3 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $92.3 million and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	We have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments.
75679_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is from cable system acquisitions.
75679_17_ITEM7_P125_S3	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_17_ITEM7_P125_S4	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	Our broadcast licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to broadcast television stations within a certain geographical area.
75679_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	The amount we have recorded for broadcast licenses is from broadcast television station acquisitions.
75679_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using October 31 as a measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.
75679_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	When evaluating our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform an assessment qualitatively to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to as a step zero approach.
75679_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	not more likely than not that the fair value of one of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying value, we would bypass the two-step impairment test.
75679_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	Events and circumstances we consider in performing the step zero qualitative assessment include macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, internal forecasts, share price fluctuations, and operational stability and overall financial performance.
75679_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	For goodwill, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we would perform the first step ( step one ) of the two-step impairment test and calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly-traded companies.
75679_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	These methods require estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, and other relevant factors, as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly-traded companies for each reporting unit.
75679_17_ITEM7_P131_S2	We estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans, industry data, and other relevant factors.
75679_17_ITEM7_P131_S3	Using assumptions that are different from those used in our estimates, but in each case reasonable, could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment for our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
75679_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	For 2016, we performed a step zero qualitative analysis for our annual assessment of impairment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
75679_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	After evaluating and weighing all relevant events and circumstances, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their carrying amounts.
75679_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	Consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis in 2016.
75679_17_ITEM7_P132_S3	For 2015, we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis rather than perform the step zero qualitative assessment.
75679_17_ITEM7_P132_S4	There was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and we determined they were not impaired.
75679_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_17_ITEM7_P133_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, based on management s belief that future reversals of existing temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_17_ITEM7_P133_S3	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect in our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	Regulatory Developments See Part I Item 1.
75679_17_ITEM7_P135_S1	Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	Inflation We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo note payable carry interest rate risk.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our Senior Credit Facility consists of a term loan, Term Loan B, and revolving credit facility.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Amounts borrowed under the term loan bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 3.00% or less depending upon our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility agreement).
75679_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Amounts borrowed under the Wells Fargo note payable bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Should the LIBOR rate change, our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2016, we have borrowed $523.8 million subject to interest rate risk.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	On this amount, each 1% increase in the LIBOR interest rate would result in $5.2 million of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis.
75679_17_ITEM7A_P2_S4	All of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) in 2013.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2016, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P7_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P7_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.
75679_17_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Items 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are omitted per General Instruction l(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K.

75679_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	The exchange ratios were determined based on total consideration of $32.50 per share in respect of each share of existing GCI common stock, comprised of $27.50 per share in GCI Liberty Class A common stock and $5.00 per share in newly issued GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock, based upon a Liberty Ventures reference price of $43.65 (with no premium paid for shares of GCI Class B common stock) and an initial liquidation price of $25.00 per share of GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock.
75679_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	The GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock will accrue dividends at an initial rate of 5% per annum (which would increase to 7% in connection with a future reincorporation of GCI Liberty in Delaware) and will be redeemable upon the 21 st anniversary of the closing.
75679_18_ITEM1_P12_S4	The closing of the Transactions are expected to be consummated on March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
75679_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	You should see Part I Item 1.
75679_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Business Regulation for additional regulatory developments.
75679_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We intend to grow the company using the following strategies:
75679_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Expand Our Product Portfolio and Footprint in Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	Throughout our history, we have successfully added and expect to continue to add new products to our product portfolio.
75679_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	We have a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for our customers, and we continue to assess revenue-enhancing opportunities that create value for our customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of our network coverage, we are currently pursuing or expect to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of our facilities, enhance our ability to serve our existing customers needs and attract new customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	Additionally, due to the unique market conditions in Alaska, we, and in some cases our customers, participate in several federal (and to a lesser extent locally) subsidized programs designed to financially support the implementation and purchase of telecommunications services like ours in high cost areas.
75679_18_ITEM1_P15_S5	With these programs we have been able to expand our network into previously undeveloped areas of Alaska and, for the first time, offer comprehensive communications services in many rural parts of the state where we would not otherwise be able to construct facilities within appropriate return-on-investment requirements.
75679_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions of telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our management team will continue to actively pursue and make investments that we believe fit with our strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.
75679_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	We sell new and enhanced services and products to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.
75679_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
75679_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have positioned ourselves as a customer service leader in the Alaska communications market.
75679_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	We operate our own customer service department and have empowered our customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call.
75679_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We prioritize our customer services to expedite handling of our most valuable customers issues, particularly for our largest commercial customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	We believe our integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows us to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
75679_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	We continue to expand and evolve our integrated network for the delivery of our services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving our customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization.
75679_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	By offering multiple services, we are better able to leverage our network assets and increase returns on our invested capital.
75679_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	We periodically evaluate our network assets and continually monitor technological developments that we can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
75679_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	We operate our business under a single reportable segment.
75679_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Effective in the first quarter of 2017, we reassessed and reorganized our management and internal reporting structures in order to make our operations more efficient, which triggered an analysis of our reportable segments.
75679_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	As a result of our assessment, we merged our former Wireless and Wireline segments into one operating segment.
75679_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	We realigned our external financial reporting to support this change.
75679_18_ITEM1_P20_S4	Our chief operating decision maker assesses our financial performance as follows:
75679_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Prior to 2017, we operated our business under two reportable segments - Wireline and Wireless.
75679_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	As a result of the reorganization of our reporting structure, assets, including goodwill, and liabilities were reassigned to a single reporting unit.
75679_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Services and Products We offer services and products to two major customer groups as follows:
75679_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Consumer - We offer a full range of retail wireless, data, video, and voice services to residential customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Business - We offer a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to businesses, governmental entities, and educational institutions, wholesale data, voice, and wireless services to common carrier customers, and regulated voice services to residential and commercial customers in rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Sales and Marketing We offer our services directly to consumer and business customers through our call center, direct mail advertising, television advertising, Internet advertising, local media advertising, and through our retail stores.
75679_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Our sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve, selling bundled services, and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities.
75679_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	We sell our managed services, wholesale data, voice, and wireless services, and data services to rural schools and health organizations through direct contact marketing.
75679_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, data and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.
75679_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and managed services expenditures, and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
75679_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	Facilities We operate a modern, competitive communications network providing switched and dedicated voice and broadband services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Our fiber network employs digital transmission technology over our fiber optic facilities within Alaska and between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
75679_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	We serve many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications.
75679_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Each of our satellite transponders is backed up on alternate spacecraft with multiple backup transponders.
75679_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	optic cable and digital microwave system ( TERRA ) linking Anchorage with the Bristol Bay, Yukon-Kuskokwim, and northwest regions of the state.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We own and operate a statewide network providing voice and data services to the urban and rural communities of Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our statewide wireless network provides 4G LTE data service, EVDO, 3G UMTS/HSPA+, 2G CDMA, and 2G GSM/EDGE service.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	We continue to expand and upgrade these services to provide a modern network for Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	We own and operate Wi-Fi access points that create a Wi-Fi network branded as TurboZone in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kenai-Soldotna, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other areas of the State ("TurboZone").
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	Our dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol data services are delivered to an Ethernet port located at the service end-point.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S5	Our management platform continuously monitors the network and service end-points for performance.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S6	The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S7	The management platform has the capability to remotely access network elements and service end-points, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service end-point.
75679_18_ITEM1_P30_S8	This management platform allows us to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
75679_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our video businesses are located throughout Alaska and serve the majority of the population.
75679_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our facilities include hybrid-fiber-coax plant and head-end distribution equipment.
75679_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	The majority of our locations on the fiber routes are served from head-end distribution equipment in Anchorage.
75679_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	All of our cable systems are completely digital.
75679_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Competition We operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment, and information products and services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior.
75679_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition We compete with AT T, Verizon, and other community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets.
75679_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.
75679_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The national wireless carriers with whom we compete, AT T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than ours.
75679_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.
75679_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	We compete for customers based principally upon price, service bundles, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, billing services, statewide network coverage and capacity, TurboZone, the type of wireless handsets offered, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
75679_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.
75679_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	Competition is based upon price, service bundles, the services and enhancements offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.
75679_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	We compete with other providers some of which are headquartered outside of Alaska and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
75679_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
75679_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems.
75679_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone.
75679_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
75679_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our video systems face competition from services and devices that offer distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, using alternative methods such as Internet video streaming and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS").
75679_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems.
75679_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
75679_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Internet video streaming is a major source of competition for our video services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Additionally, some online video services produce or acquire their own original content.
75679_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	The DBS industry is another major source of competition for our video services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	Two major companies, AT T-owned DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering high-power DBS services in Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Competitive forces may be counteracted by offering subscribers expanded programming.
75679_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	We have retransmission agreements with various broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into certain of our systems, and local programming for our customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	Additionally, our ownership of television stations provides us the opportunity to create unique content for our subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.
75679_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of effective competition.
75679_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.
75679_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.
75679_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.
75679_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
75679_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Voice Services and Products Competition Our most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling.
75679_18_ITEM1_P48_S3	We also compete against Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"), long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance.
75679_18_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have competed by offering what we believe is excellent customer service and by providing desirable bundles of services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	See Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products below for more information.
75679_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Seasonality Our services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.
75679_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.
75679_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Major Customer We had no major customer in 2017 and 2016.
75679_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Verizon was a major customer in 2015.
75679_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Environmental Regulations We undertake activities that may, under certain circumstances, affect the environment.
75679_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Accordingly, they may be subject to federal, state, and local laws designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.
75679_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The FCC, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and National Historic Preservation Act to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
75679_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon.
75679_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.
75679_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	We obtain federal, state, and local permits, as required, for our projects and operations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P54_S3	We are unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
75679_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses We do not hold franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	We hold a number of federally registered service marks used by our business.
75679_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	We own two utility patents issued in 2017 pertaining to device diagnostics and network connectivity.
75679_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.
75679_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	We hold licenses for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We hold various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use.
75679_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	These licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.
75679_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	However, we expect these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
75679_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	We hold licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years.
75679_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
75679_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide local, long distance, and video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN ).
75679_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area.
75679_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
75679_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Regulation Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.
75679_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.
75679_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.
75679_18_ITEM1_P60_S3	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Wireless Services and Products General .
75679_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.
75679_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	As wireless licensees, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC s specific regulations governing wireless services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
75679_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	environmental laws and the FCC s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas.
75679_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	The High Cost Program of the Universal Service Fund ("USF") pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.
75679_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order.
75679_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	Per the Alaska High Cost Order, as of January 1, 2017, Remote high cost support payments to Alaska High Cost participants are frozen on a per-company basis at adjusted December 2014 levels for a ten-year term in exchange for meeting individualized performance obligations to offer voice and broadband services meeting the service obligations at specified minimum speeds by five-year and ten-year service milestones to a specified number of locations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	Remote high cost support is no longer dependent upon line counts and line count filings are no longer required.
75679_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Prior to the Alaska High Cost Order, Urban high cost support payments were frozen and had phased down to 60% of the monthly average of the 2011 annual support.
75679_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	The Alaska High Cost Order mandated that as of January 1, 2017, Urban high cost support for 2017 and 2018 would be two-thirds and one-third of the December 2014 level of support received, respectively, with Urban high cost support ending effective December 31, 2018.
75679_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	On April 27, 2016, the FCC released a Third Report and Order to reform and modernize the USF s Lifeline program ("Lifeline Order").
75679_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
75679_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Lifeline Order adopted several reforms, including incentivizing and sometimes requiring broadband providers to offer fixed and/or mobile broadband service to Lifeline subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Lifeline Order also limited the number of federal programs that confer Lifeline eligibility, and made small changes to the requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	Failure to correctly judge eligibility and recertify Lifeline subscribers could materially adversely affect our Lifeline revenues and/or increase our costs in the form of FCC fines for failure to comply with Lifeline rules.
75679_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	We have completed negotiations and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska ILECs.
75679_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
75679_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	See Description of Our Business Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks for more information.
75679_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 ( E911 ) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller s phone number and approximate location.
75679_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.
75679_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Due to Alaska s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.
75679_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC s standard.
75679_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	The FCC also imposed requirements to allow users to text-to-911 if the local public safety dispatch agency requests and is able to receive such texts.
75679_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	We have developed a text-to-911 technical solution and have certified to the FCC that we are now capable of meeting the FCC requirements.
75679_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
75679_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state.
75679_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected.
75679_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the terms and conditions of wireless service.
75679_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Several states have invoked this terms and conditions authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry.
75679_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P78_S3	States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
75679_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes.
75679_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to customers and result in higher costs to customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation.
75679_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction.
75679_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012, state and local governments are further constrained in their regulation of changes to existing wireless infrastructure.
75679_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new antenna structures has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
75679_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	Data Services and Products General .
75679_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	There is no one entity or organization that governs the global operation of the Internet.
75679_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network.
75679_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies.
75679_18_ITEM1_P83_S3	The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
75679_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	The vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level.
75679_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
75679_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving.
75679_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect our costs and the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	This order prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users' and edge providers ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	The order also strengthened the FCC s transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S3	The order allowed broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S4	These rules applied equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S5	The order refrained from applying rate regulation and tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S6	On January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order that returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements described above.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S7	There are various efforts in Congress, through the federal courts of appeal, and through state legislation to re-impose the rules adopted in 2015.
75679_18_ITEM1_P86_S8	While we do not believe that the 2015 FCC order conflicts with our existing practices or offerings, the re-imposition of that regulatory framework would impose regulatory burdens, likely would increase our costs, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
75679_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	The USF Rural Health Care ("RHC") Program subsidizes the rates for services provided to rural health care providers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	For the funding year that ran from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, USAC received requests for funds that exceeded the funding available for the RHC Program.
75679_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	USAC allocated the funding on a pro-rata basis to rural health care providers who submitted their funding requests during a certain period.
75679_18_ITEM1_P87_S3	We provide services to rural health care providers who were impacted by the pro-rata allocation and as a result certain of our customers did not receive the full subsidy that was expected under the program.
75679_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	published an order on June 30, 2017 to assist eligible remote Alaska rural health care providers by allowing Alaska service providers, such as us, to retroactively lower their rates, or effectively giving a credit against amounts owed, for services provided.
75679_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	Based on these specific circumstances, we decided to retroactively lower our rates to these customers pursuant to the FCC waiver, and as a result we reduced revenue by $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to aid our rural health care provider customers who were impacted by the pro-rata allocation.
75679_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	The FCC issued an Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ( NPRM ) on December 18, 2017 and announced that requests for funds has exceeded the amount available for the funding year that runs from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 ( FY2017 ).
75679_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	The Order specifically addresses relief if a FY2017 proration is needed and directs USAC to use unused RHC program funding available at the time of proration to lower or eliminate the proration factor first for all qualifying funding requests from non-consortia health care providers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	All of our customers in the FY2017 and included in our December 31, 2017 accounts receivable are non-consortia health care providers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P89_S3	The FCC and USAC have given no guidance as to the amount of unused funding available, thus we cannot predict the amount of any such shortfall.
75679_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	The NPRM seeks comment about potential reforms to the RHC program to address future program shortfalls.
75679_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	We cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, that the FCC will adopt or the impact of any such changes.
75679_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	In 2014, the FCC adopted orders modernizing the USF Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate").
75679_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	These orders, among other things, increased the annual E-Rate cap by approximately $1.5 billion, designated funds for internal connections within schools and libraries, and eliminated funding for certain legacy services, such as voice, to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide.
75679_18_ITEM1_P91_S2	These orders did not have a material effect on the overall E-Rate support available to our schools and libraries customers, and therefore did not materially affect our revenue from such customers.
75679_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity.
75679_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service.
75679_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
75679_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for retransmission consent to carry the station.
75679_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates.
75679_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis.
75679_18_ITEM1_P96_S2	This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators.
75679_18_ITEM1_P96_S3	The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987.
75679_18_ITEM1_P96_S4	This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.
75679_18_ITEM1_P96_S5	In addition, in 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services, and on November 17, 2015, took further steps to bring telecommunications and cable pole attachment rates into parity.
75679_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	Though the general purpose of the rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.
75679_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	We cannot predict the likelihood of the RCA changing its formula, adopting the federal formula, or relinquishing its oversight of pole attachments to the FCC, any of which could increase the cost of our operations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.
75679_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals.
75679_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.
75679_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.
75679_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Wireline Voice Services and Products General.
75679_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P102_S2	Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
75679_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1_P103_S2	Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
75679_18_ITEM1_P103_S3	See Description of Our Business - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service for information on USF reform.
75679_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such rural exemption or otherwise finds it not to apply.
75679_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc.'s ( ACS ) in its Anchorage study area.
75679_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	We participated in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs.
75679_18_ITEM1_P105_S2	In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC s rural exemption.
75679_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.
75679_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P107_S0	See Description of Our Business Competition Voice Services and Products Competition for more information.
75679_18_ITEM1_P108_S0	Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees.
75679_18_ITEM1_P109_S0	The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.
75679_18_ITEM1_P109_S1	In 2011, the FCC released rules to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.
75679_18_ITEM1_P109_S2	The details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.
75679_18_ITEM1_P109_S3	We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our operations.
75679_18_ITEM1_P110_S0	The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of our local access services business.
75679_18_ITEM1_P110_S1	We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be changed in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rule modifications that are yet to be determined by the FCC.
75679_18_ITEM1_P110_S2	Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.
75679_18_ITEM1_P110_S3	Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets.
75679_18_ITEM1_P111_S0	On July 7, 2017, ACS filed a petition in which it asked the FCC to regulate us as an ILEC pursuant to section 251(h)(2) of the Communications Act, including the requirement to provide competitors with access to unbundled network elements.
75679_18_ITEM1_P111_S1	We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding.
75679_18_ITEM1_P111_S2	However, grant of the petition in its entirety may subject us to regulatory burdens that could materially impact our costs.
75679_18_ITEM1_P112_S0	We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks.
75679_18_ITEM1_P112_S1	Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites.
75679_18_ITEM1_P112_S2	We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing.
75679_18_ITEM1_P113_S0	The Communications Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
75679_18_ITEM1_P114_S0	Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks.
75679_18_ITEM1_P114_S1	In 2014, the FCC adopted an order calling for experiments to examine how best to accelerate the technological and regulatory transitions from traditional TDM-based networks to IP-based technologies.
75679_18_ITEM1_P114_S2	Although no entity has proposed conducting a technology transition experiment in our service territory in response to the FCC s 2014 order, additional proposals for experiments are possible.
75679_18_ITEM1_P114_S3	We cannot predict whether additional proposals for experiments might be submitted to the FCC nor any resulting proceedings or their effect on us.
75679_18_ITEM1_P115_S0	The FCC also has other open dockets through which it might make changes to the regulatory regime applicable to IP-based networks.
75679_18_ITEM1_P115_S1	A change in regulatory obligation or classification that interferes with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
75679_18_ITEM1_P116_S0	We do not have significant foreign operations or export sales.
75679_18_ITEM1_P116_S1	We conduct our operations throughout the contiguous United States and Alaska and believe that any subdivision of our operations into distinct geographic areas would not be meaningful.
75679_18_ITEM1_P117_S0	Company-Sponsored Research We have not expended material amounts during the last three fiscal years on company-sponsored research activities.
75679_18_ITEM1_P118_S0	Employees We employed 2,208 persons as of December 31, 2017, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
75679_18_ITEM1_P118_S1	We believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
75679_18_ITEM1_P118_S2	We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
75679_18_ITEM1_P119_S0	Other No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	There is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Through mergers, various service integration strategies, and business alliances, major providers are striving to strengthen their competitive positions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We face increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our wholesale customers including our major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they contract with us to use our network to provide service on their behalf.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We would experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of our wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is provided on our network.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than we do.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We expect to continue to offer competitive alternatives to such customers in order to retain significant traffic on our network.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We cannot predict whether such negotiations will be successful.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our inability to negotiate such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	For more information about competition, see the section titled Competition included in Part 1 Item 1 Business Description of our Business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers perceptions of our services, and customer care quality.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Managing these factors and subscribers expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Some of our competitors have national networks that enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:
75679_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Although the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Commercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While we believe that we are currently in compliance with such FCC rules, the failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We use tower facilities for the provision of our wireless services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The FCC requires local notice in any community in which an applicant is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	This rule could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The order prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users' and edge providers' ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The order also strengthened the FCC's transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The order allowed broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The new rules applied equally to wired and wireless broadband services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The order refrained from imposing rate regulation or tariff requirements on broadband services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	On January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order that returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements described above.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	There are various efforts in Congress, through the federal courts of appeal, and through state legislation to re-impose the rules adopted in 2015.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We cannot predict whether the FCC will re-impose the 2015 rules, but if it did, it is possible that the FCC could interpret or apply those rules in a way that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Other existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact on the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to unbundled network elements.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	For more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see Part 1 Item 1 Business Regulation.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Loss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Revenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	This support was 26% , 24% , and 19% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We had USF net receivables of $131.8 million and $100.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Additionally, the USF RHC Program subsidizes the rates for services provided to rural health care providers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	USAC received requests for support that exceeded the available RHC Program funding for the first time in the funding year that ran from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We expect that the support requests will continue to exceed the program's annual cap for the funding year ending June 30, 2018 and possibly subsequent funding years.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We provide services to rural health care providers who may be impacted by funding caps and as a result may not receive the full subsidy that was expected under the program.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We cannot predict the impact of future RHC Program funding caps but they may negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	See Description of Our Business Regulation Wireless Services and Products Universal Service and Description of Our Business Regulation Wireline Voice Services and Products Universal Service for more information.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may not meet our performance plan milestones under the Alaska High Cost Order.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	As an ETC, we receive support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which requires us to submit to the FCC a performance plan with five-year and ten-year commitments.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we are unable to meet the final performance plan milestones approved by the FCC we will be required to repay 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received over the ten-year term for the relevant number of locations that we failed to deploy to, plus ten percent of our total Alaska High Cost Order support received over the ten-year term.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Inability to meet our performance plan milestones could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may lose USF high cost support if another carrier adds 4G LTE service in an area where we currently provide 4G LTE service.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Under the Alaska High Cost Order, the FCC adopted a process for revisiting after five years whether and to what extent there is duplicative support for 4G LTE service in rural Alaska and to take steps to eliminate such duplicative support levels in the second half of the ten-year term.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	As a result, if another carrier builds 4G LTE service in an area where we are the sole provider and the FCC decides to redistribute the support then our high cost support may be reduced which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are unable to raise our customers rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The decline in our voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We expect our voice services results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenues will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") program for funding our TERRA project.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We have entered into five separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA project.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which were restricted for use on TERRA.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $65.8 million in NMTCs plus interest and penalties until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in various stages from August 2018 through December 2024.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Failure to stay abreast of new technology could affect our ability to compete in the industry.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness and increase the utility of our services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As our operations grow in size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile or tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We may not successfully complete the rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete with advancing technology or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost effective manner.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our business is geographically concentrated in Alaska and is impacted by the economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We offer products and services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Prolonged periods of low oil prices will adversely impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Oil prices have continued to remain low which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues come from the oil industry.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of lower oil prices.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Alaska economy is in a recession that started in late 2015.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	While it is difficult for us to predict the future impact of the continuing recession on our business, these conditions have had an adverse impact on our business and could continue to adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Additionally, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	If the recession continues, it could continue to negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The customer base in Alaska is limited and we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We may not be able to continue to increase our share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Natural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that our technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Additionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Cyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Cyberattacks against our technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of our operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to our customers, our assets, and our reputation.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	To date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Nevertheless, we engage in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to us, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard our infrastructure and confidential customer information.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat detection, and URL filtering.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Despite these preventive and detective actions, our efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Some of the most significant risks to our information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:
75679_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of our vendors and other providers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	If hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer data.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	A network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, litigation, fines, and sanctions, lost revenues from business interruption, and damage to the public s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Increases in data usage on our wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Video streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	As use of these services continues to grow, our customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on our wireless network.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P68_S5	While we believe demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude us from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and operating results.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Prolonged service interruptions or system failures could affect our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	We are able to deliver services and serve our customers only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S3	While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Disruption to our billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S5	Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P70_S6	In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA facilities and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Our facilities also include TERRA and its extensions some of which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P72_S3	If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or our ringed TERRA facility and its unringed extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	If a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P79_S4	The failure of our key suppliers to provide products or product support could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	As is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We are in the process of transferring our customer billing systems to a new third-party vendor.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects on our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves moving to a new third-party billing services vendor and platform in 2018.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	The implementation may cause major system or business disruptions or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S4	In addition, the third-party billing services vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, or attract new customers, and negatively impact overall customer experience.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P82_S6	Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our significant debt and lease obligations could adversely affect our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and lease obligations including capital, operating, and the tower obligation (see Note 2 included in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information).
75679_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Our high level of debt and lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:
75679_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The terms of our debt obligations impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the debt obligations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	All of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P92_S3	If there were an event of default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P92_S5	Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace one or both.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	When our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow could decrease.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Any significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	We had $530.8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2017, consisting of goodwill of $242.3 million , cable certificates of $191.6 million , wireless licenses of $93.8 million and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our broadcast licenses represent permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, in the period in which the determination is made.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P103_S2	These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	GCI, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax returns as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P105_S2	At December 31, 2017, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $361.9 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P105_S3	If GCI experiences an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when its market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P105_S4	This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Concerns about health/safety risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We do not manufacture devices or other equipment sold by us, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P107_S2	However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P107_S3	We cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P108_S2	We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P108_S3	The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P108_S4	Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P108_S5	However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	A significant percentage of GCI's voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	As of December 31, 2017, GCI's executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 15% of its combined outstanding common stock, representing 25% of the combined voting power of that stock.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P111_S1	These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to GCI's Board.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We expect to incur significant costs and expenses in connection with the Transactions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We expect to incur certain nonrecurring costs in connection with the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, including advisory, legal and other transaction costs.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P113_S1	A majority of these costs have already been incurred or will be incurred regardless of whether the Transactions are completed.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P113_S2	While many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time, we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the Transactions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Although we expect that the realization of benefits related to the Transactions will offset such costs and expenses over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Additionally, the inputs that impact the estimate of value of our derivative stock appreciation rights have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by the Transactions with Liberty which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	The announcement and pendency of the Transactions could divert the attention of management and cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Liberty and GCI are unaffiliated companies that are currently operated independently of each other.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Our management may be required to divert a disproportionate amount of attention away from their respective day-to-day activities and operations, and devote time and effort to consummating the Transactions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P116_S2	The risks, and adverse effects, of such disruptions and diversions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Transactions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P116_S3	These factors could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations, regardless of whether the Transactions are completed.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We are subject to contractual restrictions while the Transactions are pending, which could adversely affect our business.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The Reorganization Agreement imposes certain restrictive interim covenants on us.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P118_S1	For instance, the consent of Liberty is required in respect of, among other things, amendments to our organizational documents, repurchases of GCI common stock on GCI's behalf, certain actions relating to material contracts, certain employee benefit changes, limitations on capital expenditures and limitations on dispositions, and payments of dividends on GCI's behalf.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P118_S2	These restrictions may prevent us from taking certain actions before the closing of the Transactions or the termination of the Reorganization Agreement, including making certain acquisitions or otherwise pursuing certain business opportunities that GCI's board of directors may deem beneficial.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Failure to complete the Transactions could negatively impact our future business and financial results.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	If the Transactions are not completed for any reason, we may be subject to numerous risks, including the following:
75679_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We may experience harm to our business due to the following: (i) operating under the restrictions on the conduct of our business set forth in the Reorganization Agreement, (ii) having our management divert attention away from their respective day-to-day activities and operations and devoting time and effort to consummating the Transactions and (iii) incurring significant costs, including advisory, legal and other transaction costs, each as explained above, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Transactions.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	In addition, we could be subject to the cost of litigation related to any dispute regarding an alleged failure of a closing condition or any related enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Reorganization Agreement or any of the other transaction documents, as well as any judgment potentially sustained against us in any such action.
75679_18_ITEM1A_P122_S1	All of these risks, expenses and contingencies could adversely affect our financial position and results of operation.
75679_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease most of our executive, corporate and administrative facilities and business offices.
75679_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our operating, executive, corporate and administrative properties are in good condition.
75679_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	We consider our properties suitable and adequate for our present needs and they are being fully utilized.
75679_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Our properties consist primarily of undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks, switching equipment, satellite transponders and earth stations, microwave radio, cable and wire facilities, cable head-end equipment, wireless towers and equipment, coaxial distribution networks, connecting lines (aerial, underground and buried cable), routers, servers, transportation equipment, computer equipment, general office equipment, land, land improvements, landing stations and other buildings.

75679_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Dividends GCI and GCI, Inc. have never paid cash dividends on GCI's common stock, and we have no present intention of doing so.
75679_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	Payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be determined by GCI's Board of Directors in light of our earnings, financial condition and other relevant considerations.
75679_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	Our existing debt agreements contain provisions that limit payment of dividends on common stock, other than stock dividends (see Note 7 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information).

75679_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Act ) enacted on April 5, 2012.
75679_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	As a result, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.
75679_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
75679_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
75679_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	However, we are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.
75679_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
75679_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Part IV of this Form 10-K.
75679_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Update on Economic Conditions We offer wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed services to customers primarily throughout Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska.
75679_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism.
75679_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Prolonged periods of low oil prices adversely impacts the Alaska economy, which in turn can have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition.
75679_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Oil prices have continued to remain low which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues have historically come from the oil industry.
75679_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of lower oil prices.
75679_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Alaska economy is in a recession that started in late 2015.
75679_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	While it is difficult for us to predict the future impact of the continuing recession on our business, these conditions have had an adverse impact on our business and could continue to adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services.
75679_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Additionally, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us.
75679_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.
75679_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	If the recession continues, it could continue to negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.
75679_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	General Overview Through our focus on long-term results, acquisitions, and strategic capital investments, we strive to consistently grow our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
75679_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We have historically met our cash needs for operations and regular and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities.
75679_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Historically, cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities.
75679_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Major Developments On April 4, 2017, General Communication, Inc., Liberty and Liberty LLC, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as may be amended from time to time, the Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Transactions ).
75679_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, General Communication, Inc. amended and restated its articles of incorporation resulting in General Communication, Inc. being renamed GCI Liberty, Inc. and a reclassification and auto conversion of its common stock.
75679_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Following these events, Liberty will acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain interests, assets and liabilities of the Liberty Ventures will be contributed to GCI Liberty in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI Liberty.
75679_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	closing date of the contribution, respectively, and (ii) cash, and (b) the assumption by GCI Liberty of certain liabilities attributed to Liberty Ventures.
75679_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Following the contribution and acquisition of GCI Liberty, Liberty will then effect a tax-free separation of its controlling interest in GCI Liberty to the holders of Liberty Ventures common stock in full redemption of all outstanding shares of such stock.
75679_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	As a result of the Transactions, holders of GCI common stock (regardless of class) each will receive (i) 0.63 of a share of GCI Liberty Class A common stock and (ii) 0.20 of a share of new GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock in exchange for each share of their existing GCI common stock.
75679_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	The exchange ratios were determined based on total consideration of $32.50 per share in respect of each share of existing GCI common stock, comprised of $27.50 per share in GCI Liberty Class A common stock and $5.00 per share in newly issued GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock, based upon a Liberty Ventures reference price of $43.65 (with no premium paid for shares of GCI Class B common stock) and an initial liquidation price of $25.00 per share of GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock.
75679_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	The GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock will accrue dividends at an initial rate of 5% per annum (which would increase to 7% in connection with a future reincorporation of GCI Liberty in Delaware) and will be redeemable upon the 21 st anniversary of the closing.
75679_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	The closing of the Transactions are expected to be consummated on March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
75679_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	In the third quarter of 2016, we received $90.8 million for the initial closing to sell to Vertical Bridge Towers II, LLC ( Vertical Bridge ) the majority of our urban wireless rooftop and tower sites ("Tower Transaction").
75679_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Additionally, we entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Vertical Bridge to lease collocation space on communications towers and facilities that were sold to Vertical Bridge.
75679_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	We sold additional tower sites to Vertical Bridge in 2017 for total consideration of $6.8 million.
75679_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	The USF RHC Program subsidizes the rates for services provided to rural health care providers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	USAC received requests for support that exceeded the available RHC Program funding for the first time in the funding year that ran from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.
75679_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	We expect that the support requests will continue to exceed the program's annual cap for the funding year ending June 30, 2018 and possibly subsequent funding years.
75679_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	We provide services to rural health care providers who may be impacted by funding caps and as a result may not receive the full subsidy that was expected under the program.
75679_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	We cannot predict the impact of future RHC Program funding caps but they may negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
75679_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	In August 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which mandates that Urban high cost support will end at the beginning of 2019.
75679_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We recognized $9.9 million for Urban high cost support in 2017 and expect to recognize $9.9 million in 2018 and $0 in 2019.
75679_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	In February 2015, we purchased ACS' interest in The Alaska Wireless Network, LLC ("AWN") and substantially all the assets of ACS and its affiliates related to ACS s wireless operations ( Acquired ACS Assets ) (collectively the "Wireless Acquisition").
75679_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, we transfered to ACS a cash payment of $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and agreed to terminate or amend certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	The Acquired ACS Assets included substantially all of ACS s wireless subscriber assets, including subscriber contracts, and certain of ACS s CDMA network assets, including fiber strands and associated cell site electronics and microwave facilities and associated electronics.
75679_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We assumed from ACS post-closing liabilities of ACS and its affiliates under contracts assumed by us and liabilities with respect to the ownership by ACS of its equity interest in AWN to the extent accruing and related to the period after closing.
75679_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	All other liabilities were retained by ACS and its affiliates.
75679_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	Following the close of the Wireless Acquisition, AWN is a wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	We funded the purchase with a $275.0 million Term Loan B under our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI.
75679_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	The components of revenue are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Consumer The recession in Alaska has impacted our ability to increase our number of subscribers and customers cutting back on the services the receive from us, which have impacted our revenues.
75679_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The items contributing to the decrease in wireless revenue for 2017 and 2016 include:
75679_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	A $4.9 million or 16% and $2.4 million or 7% decrease in equipment sales revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
75679_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The decrease in equipment sales revenue in 2017 was primarily due to the absence of the adjustment explained in the following discussion.
75679_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	The decrease in equipment sales revenue in 2016 was partially offset by a $4.1 million adjustment to lower the guarantee liability for our Upgrade Now program (please see Note 1 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on the guarantee liability) that was recorded in the third quarter of 2016.
75679_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Based on a review of historical information, we determined that our customers were not trading their devices in as early and frequently as originally estimated.
75679_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	able to resell the used handsets for prices higher than originally estimated.
75679_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Based on this new information, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the guarantee liability recorded for financed devices in our Upgrade Now program.
75679_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	The decreases in 2017 and 2016 were also partially due to a decrease in the number of wireless devices sold.
75679_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	The increase in data revenue in 2017 is primarily due to subscribers' selection of plans that offer higher speeds and higher usage limits and revenue from small business subscribers transferred from our Business customer group.
75679_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the overall number of subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	The increase in data revenue in 2016 is primarily due to a $12.8 million or 11% increase in cable modem revenue for 2016 due to an increase in the average number of subscribers and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds and higher usage limits.
75679_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Consumer video revenue faces challenges as more customers choose to have their video content delivered via the Internet.
75679_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, this selection may result in additional data service revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
75679_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	We expect Consumer voice revenue to continue to decrease due to a growing number of customers using wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local and long distance calling.
75679_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Business The recession in Alaska has had an impact on both the number of businesses in Alaska as well as the services that business customers have chosen.
75679_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The decrease in the number of businesses and services have impacted our revenues and we expect it to continue impacting us until the recession in Alaska ends.
75679_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Business data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on-site customer support.
75679_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	This latter category can vary significantly based on project activity.
75679_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	This revenue faces challenges due to the decline in oil prices which negatively impacts certain of our customers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The increase in data revenue in 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to a $5.8 million or 2% and $32.4 million or 15% increase, respectively, in data transport and storage revenue due to new customers and increased purchases by our existing customers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase in data revenue in 2017 was also partially due to a $6.8 million or 17% increase in time and materials revenue primarily due to an acquisition that was completed during the first quarter of 2017.
75679_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increases in data revenue for 2017 were partially offset by decreases due to rate compression and a $5.5 million reduction of revenue recorded during 2017 as a result of a credit we provided to certain of our rural health care provider customers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	For the funding year that ran from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, USAC received requests for funds that exceeded the funding available for the RHC Program.
75679_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	USAC allocated the funding on a pro-rata basis to rural health care providers who submitted their funding requests during a certain period.
75679_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	We provide services to rural health care providers who were impacted by the pro-rata allocation and as a result certain of our customers did not receive the full subsidy that was expected under the program.
75679_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	Under the program rules, we are forbidden from lowering our rates for services previously provided, however, the FCC published an order on June 30, 2017 to assist eligible remote Alaska rural health care providers by allowing Alaska service providers, such as us, to retroactively lower their rates, or effectively giving a credit against amounts owed, for services provided.
75679_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	Based on these specific circumstances, we decided to retroactively lower our rates to these customers pursuant to the FCC waiver, and as a result we reduced revenue by $5.5 million during 2017, to aid our rural health care provider customers who were impacted by the pro-rata allocation.
75679_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The increases in data revenue for 2016 were partially offset by a $5.3 million or 11% decrease in time and materials revenue due to a decrease in special project work for 2016.
75679_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The decrease in wireless revenue in 2016 is primarily due to the following:
75679_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	A $6.1 million or 36% decrease in plan fee revenue primarily due to discounts given to customers who finance or bring their own device and a decrease in subscribers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Business voice revenue continues to face competition and rate compression and to a lesser extent the substitution of wireless devices.
75679_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Cost of Goods Sold Cost of Goods Sold are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The individually significant items contributing to the 2017 and 2016 decreases in Cost of Goods Sold include:
75679_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	A $3.2 million or 12% and $3.3 million or 11% decrease in voice Cost of Goods Sold for 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in minutes, a decrease in the number of local access lines, and the movement of more traffic to our own facilities.
75679_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	We expect to face continued increases in programming costs that may require us to drop certain channels or increase the rates paid by our customers that may result in a loss of additional video customers.
75679_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Individually significant items contributing to the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses include:
75679_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The increases discussed above are partially offset by the following items:
75679_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The absence of $9.0 million for costs related to the acquisition of ACS' wireless subscribers and its non-controlling interest in AWN for 2016.
75679_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	As a percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses were 40% , 38% , and 35% of revenue for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
75679_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The 2017 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to the costs related to the Transactions with Liberty.
75679_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as percentage of total revenues is primarily due to increases in labor and contract labor costs without corresponding increases in revenue due to spending on our billing system conversion.
75679_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The increases in 2017 and 2016 are primarily due to new assets placed in service in those years partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during those years.
75679_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Software Impairment Charge Software impairment charge decreased $29.8 million or 100% in 2016 primarily due to the absence of an impairment charge recorded in 2015 as discussed below.
75679_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we internally developed computer software to replace our wireless, Internet, video, local service, and long distance customer billing systems.
75679_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	In early 2015, we completed a detailed assessment of our progress to date and determined it was no longer probable that the computer software being developed would be completed and placed in service.
75679_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Our assessment concluded that the cost of continuing the development would be much higher than originally estimated, and the timing and scope risks were substantial.
75679_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	We identified development work, hardware, and software recorded as Construction in Progress in early 2015, that may be applicable to our replacement customer billing solution, future internally developed software, and other system needs and therefore should remain capital assets.
75679_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	We considered the remaining capital expenditures for this billing system to have a fair value of $0 and recorded an impairment charge of $20.7 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
75679_18_ITEM7_P50_S5	Subsequently we signed a contract with an established billing solution provider and a multi-year implementation is in process.
75679_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	In early 2015, we reassessed our plans for our internally developed machine-to-machine billing system and decided to no longer market this system to third parties.
75679_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Accordingly we recognized an impairment of $7.1 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
75679_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	In late 2015, we evaluated user management software we purchased in 2014 and determined that we would not be able to use the software.
75679_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	Accordingly we recognized an impairment of $1.0 million during 2015 by recording an expense which is included in Software Impairment Charge in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.
75679_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of other income, follows (amounts in thousands):
75679_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Items contributing to the increase in 2017 include:
75679_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The absence of a $3.2 million gain recorded in 2016 for adjusting to fair value assets that were included in the consideration paid to acquire a fiber system.
75679_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Items contributing to the decrease in 2016 include:
75679_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	A $3.2 million gain recorded for adjusting to fair value assets that were included in the consideration paid to acquire a fiber system.
75679_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Income Tax (Expense) Benefit GCI, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary and member of the GCI controlled group of corporations, files its income tax return as part of the consolidated group of corporations under GCI.
75679_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Accordingly, all discussions regarding income taxes reflect the consolidated group's activity.
75679_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Our income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented herein using the separate-entity method.
75679_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The income tax benefit for 2017 was primarily a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts Jobs Act ( Tax Reform ) in December 2017.
75679_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The primary provisions of Tax Reform impacting us are the reduction to the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and temporary 100% bonus depreciation for certain assets.
75679_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	The change in the tax law required us to remeasure existing net deferred tax liabilities using the lower rate in the year of enactment resulting in an income tax benefit of $43.5 million for 2017 to reflect these changes.
75679_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Partially off-setting the impact of Tax Reform on our effective income tax rate in 2017 and primarily impacting our effective income tax rates for 2016 and 2015 was the volatility of our income (loss) before income taxes and permanent differences.
75679_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	At December 31, 2017, we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $361.9 million that will begin expiring in 2020 if not utilized.
75679_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	We have recorded deferred tax assets of $102.0 million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from 2000 to 2017 and that expire from 2020 to 2037.
75679_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.
75679_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense.
75679_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	We estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be (15%) to (20%) in the year ending December 31, 2018.
75679_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents.
75679_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	We believe, but can provide no assurances, that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity, capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents, credit facilities, and other external financing and equity sources.
75679_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities, capital expenditures will likely be reduced, which would likely reduce future revenues.
75679_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	In the first and fourth quarters of 2017, we entered into additional financing arrangements under the NMTC program, which provided $6.6 million in net cash to help fund the continued expansion of our TERRA network (see Note 13 included in "Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information).
75679_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2016, we amended our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	The amended Senior Credit Facility provided a $215.0 million Term Loan A, a $245.9 million Term Loan B, and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, with a $50.0 million sub-limit for standby letters of credit.
75679_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	provided that, if the 2021 Senior Notes are not refinanced by December 3, 2020, then all of the loans under the Senior Credit Facility become due on such date.
75679_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	We paid $4.1 million in fees associated with the amendment.
75679_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	As discussed above in the General Overview section, in the third quarter of 2016 we received $90.8 million for the Tower Transaction.
75679_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	In the first quarter of 2016, we entered into new long-term roaming and backhaul agreements with our largest roaming partners.
75679_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The revenue recognized for these contracts was determined by calculating the cumulative minimum cash payments and recognizing the amount evenly over the life of the contracts.
75679_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	In the early years of the contracts, the cash received is in excess of the revenue recognized resulting in a significant increase in long-term deferred revenue; in the later years the cash received will be less than the revenue recognized and will lower long-term deferred revenue.
75679_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition to purchase ACS' wireless subscriber base and its one-third ownership interest in AWN for $293.2 million excluding working capital adjustments and the termination or amendment of certain agreements related to the use of ACS network assets that were included as part of the original transaction that closed in July 2013.
75679_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Following the close of the transaction, AWN is our wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to 100% of the future cash flows from AWN.
75679_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	We used proceeds from our Senior Credit Facility and a contribution from GCI to fund the purchase from ACS.
75679_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	In the second quarter of 2015, we closed on the issuance of $450.0 million of new 6.875% Senior Notes due 2025 ("2025 Notes") at an issue price of 99.105%.
75679_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	The net proceeds of the offering were used to retire our existing 2019 Notes.
75679_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	We paid closing costs totaling $7.9 million in connection with the offering.
75679_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	While our short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise, turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms, which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.
75679_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.
75679_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
75679_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures.
75679_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future.
75679_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed.
75679_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our cash expenditures for property and equipment, including construction in progress, totaled $189.4 million and $194.5 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
75679_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during 2018, we expect our 2018 capital expenditures to total approximately $170.0 million.
75679_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	This estimate is based on purchases in 2018 regardless of the timing of cash payments.
75679_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2017 consists primarily of borrowings from our Senior Credit Facility, net of payments partially offset by repurchases of GCI's stock.
75679_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 consists primarily of cash received from the Tower Transaction partially offset by repurchases of GCI's stock, payments on our Senior Credit Facility, net of borrowings, and costs paid for the amendment to our Senior Credit Facility.
75679_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	Our borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs.
75679_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	We may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase GCI's common stock depending on various factors, such as market conditions.
75679_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	We had a $100.0 million outstanding balance and $21.0 million in letters of credit under the $200.0 million Senior Credit Facility Revolver at December 31, 2017 , which leaves $79.0 million available for borrowing as of December 31, 2017 .
75679_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Debt Covenants We are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ), our 2025 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	We are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business.
75679_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Share Repurchases GCI s Board of Directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of GCI common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of its common stock.
75679_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	During 2017 we repurchased, on GCI's behalf, 0.2 million shares of GCI common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of $4.0 million excluding shares withheld to cover employee tax liabilities resulting from the vesting of restricted stock awards.
75679_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	GCI temporarily suspended the buyback program due to the Reorganization Agreement that it entered into with Liberty.
75679_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (amounts in thousands):
75679_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Long-term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our 2021 and 2025 Notes, Senior Credit Facility, and the Wells Fargo note payable.
75679_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	Interest on the amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo note payable are based on variable rates.
75679_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	We used the current rate paid on our Senior Credit Facility to estimate our future interest payments.
75679_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	Our 2021 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $11.0 million through June 2021 and our 2025 Notes require semi-annual interest payments of $15.5 million through April 2025.
75679_18_ITEM7_P80_S4	For a discussion of our long-term debt see Note 7 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Capital lease obligations consist primarily of our obligation to lease transponder capacity on Galaxy 18.
75679_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	For a discussion of our capital and operating leases, see Note 14 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Tower obligations consist of our obligation to Vertical Bridge for the Master Lease Agreement that we entered into as part of the Tower Transaction.
75679_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations, which are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2017, because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at December 31, 2017.
75679_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose and off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources.
75679_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 included in Part II Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for recently issued accounting pronouncements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP.
75679_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
75679_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	Our financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding reported results.
75679_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
75679_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
75679_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices, and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP.
75679_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.
75679_18_ITEM7_P88_S3	Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with GCI's Audit Committee.
75679_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	Those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended December 31, 2017 are described below.
75679_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	We record expense to maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses that result from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments.
75679_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	When determining the allowance, we consider the probability of recoverability based on past experience, economic data, and changes in our collections processes.
75679_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	Credit risks are assessed based on historical write-offs, net of recoveries, as well as an analysis of the aged accounts and installment receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages.
75679_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	Accounts receivable may be fully reserved when specific collection issues are known to exist, such as pending bankruptcy or catastrophes.
75679_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Impairment and Useful Lives of Intangible Assets We had $530.8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2017, consisting of goodwill of $242.3 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $93.8 million and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million.
75679_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition.
75679_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	We have determined that our reporting unit is the same as our reportable segment.
75679_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business.
75679_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	The value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services.
75679_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	The amount we have recorded for cable certificates is from cable system acquisitions.
75679_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.
75679_18_ITEM7_P94_S4	The amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum.
75679_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our broadcast licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to broadcast television stations within a certain geographical area.
75679_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	The amount we have recorded for broadcast licenses is from broadcast television station acquisitions.
75679_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter using October 31 as a measurement date unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.
75679_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	When evaluating our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform an assessment qualitatively to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to as a step zero approach.
75679_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	If, based on the review of the qualitative factors, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of one of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying value, we would bypass the two-step impairment test.
75679_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Events and circumstances we consider in performing the step zero qualitative assessment include macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, internal forecasts, share price fluctuations, and operational stability and overall financial performance.
75679_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	fair value of the reporting unit by using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly-traded companies.
75679_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	These methods require estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, and other relevant factors, as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly-traded companies for each reporting unit.
75679_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	We estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans, industry data, and other relevant factors.
75679_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	Using assumptions that are different from those used in our estimates, but in each case reasonable, could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment for our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
75679_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	For 2017 and 2016, we performed a step zero qualitative analysis for our annual assessment of impairment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
75679_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	After evaluating and weighing all relevant events and circumstances, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their carrying amounts.
75679_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	Consequently, we did not perform a step one quantitative analysis in 2017 or 2016.
75679_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets.
75679_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	We have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, based on management s belief that future reversals of existing temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time.
75679_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect in our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
75679_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	A complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
75679_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Regulatory Developments See Part I Item 1.
75679_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	Business Regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us.
75679_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	Inflation We do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our Senior Credit Facility and Wells Fargo note payable carry interest rate risk.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our Senior Credit Facility consists of a term loan, Term Loan B, and revolving credit facility.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Amounts borrowed under the term loan bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 3.00% or less depending upon our Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility agreement).
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan B bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Amounts borrowed under the Wells Fargo note payable bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Should the LIBOR rate change, our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we have borrowed $565.6 million subject to interest rate risk.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S6	On this amount, each 1% increase in the LIBOR interest rate would result in $5.7 million of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis.
75679_18_ITEM7A_P1_S7	All of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure, and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation and as described below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The certifications attached as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report should be read in conjunction with the disclosures set forth herein.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
75679_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) in 2013.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2017, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P6_S4	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P6_S5	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
75679_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We may enhance, modify, and supplement internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures based on experience.
75679_18_ITEM9B_P0_S0	Items 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are omitted per General Instruction l(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K.

75679_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	By striving to treat each other and those with whom we do business in accordance with the Declaration of Principles and this Code, we will maintain our focus and harmony in pursuing GCI s business goals and our pride in being part of the GCI team.
75679_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	Act in the best interest of GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P131_S1	Avoid situations which may conflict with this obligation.
75679_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	A conflict of interest exists when an employee has a personal (usually financial) interest that might interfere with the loyalty that the employee owes on business matters to GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	A conflict of interest can lead to a situation where an employee fails (or is perceived to have failed) to act in GCI s best interest because of a personal interest.
75679_18_ITEM15_P132_S2	All of us as employees must strive to avoid conflicts of interest, as well as the appearance of such conflicts.
75679_18_ITEM15_P132_S3	An employee must not further his or her personal interest at GCI s expense.
75679_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	A conflict or perceived conflict can arise when an employee:
75679_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Works for a competitor of GCI or otherwise competes with GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	Makes a personal investment in an organization that does business or competes with GCI to an extent that might impair, or be perceived to impair, the employee s ability to make objective decisions in the best interest of GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	Does personal business with an organization that does business or competes with GCI in a manner that might impair, or be perceived to impair, the employee s ability to make objective decisions in the best interest of GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	Takes advantage of a business opportunity that was discovered through the use of his or her status as a GCI employee or through information that belongs to GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	Hires or supervises an individual with whom he or she has a personal relationship.
75679_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	Stands to gain personally (other than from a company-sanctioned incentive compensation plan) from any GCI business transaction.
75679_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	Accepts a gift, discount, favor, hospitality or services that might impair, or be perceived to impair, the employee s ability to make objective decisions in the best interest of GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P140_S1	Employees are expected to use good judgment guided by reasonable ethical and legal practices of the marketplace.
75679_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	Not all conflicts of interest are clear cut.
75679_18_ITEM15_P141_S1	Many conflicts can be mitigated if identified in advance.
75679_18_ITEM15_P141_S2	As employees, we have a duty to disclose to our managers or supervisors any potential conflict of interest, including any instance where the value or cost of business hospitality could be interpreted as negatively affecting an otherwise objective business decision.
75679_18_ITEM15_P141_S3	Disclosure allows GCI to determine whether the potential conflict is serious and to take action to mitigate the conflict or otherwise prevent a potentially serious conflict from becoming an actual conflict.
75679_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	GCI believes in a fair and open market for the buying and selling of securities.
75679_18_ITEM15_P142_S1	As a publicly traded corporation, we have a special obligation to comply with securities laws.
75679_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	Stocks, bonds, and other investments bought and sold in public financial markets are called securities.
75679_18_ITEM15_P143_S1	Companies that issue securities to institutional and individual investors are called publicly traded companies.
75679_18_ITEM15_P143_S2	GCI is a publicly traded company.
75679_18_ITEM15_P143_S3	Our Class A common stock, for example, trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the stock symbol GNCMA.
75679_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	All employees have the opportunity to acquire and hold GCI securities if we wish.
75679_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	In the course of his or her work, an employee may learn about material, non-public things - such as GCI s recent financial performance or an upcoming GCI acquisition - that once known to the public, could cause the prices of these securities to go up or down.
75679_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	Buying or selling a security on the basis of material, non-public information gained as an employee of the publicly traded company that issued the security is known as insider trading.
75679_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	Providing such information to another person, including a family member or friend, is known as insider tipping.
75679_18_ITEM15_P145_S2	Both practices give an employee (considered an insider under securities laws) and/or his or her family and friends an unfair advantage over the general public.
75679_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	Insider trading and insider tipping are violations of the securities laws and the Code.
75679_18_ITEM15_P146_S1	To avoid such violations, which could lead to a criminal prosecution under securities laws, we as employees must:
75679_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	Recognize that all non-public GCI information is considered confidential and proprietary and must not be used for personal gain.
75679_18_ITEM15_P147_S1	or she obtains in the course of conducting company business.
75679_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	Not use material, non-public GCI information to trade in GCI s securities.
75679_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	The term material information means any information that would reasonably be considered important by an investor and would reasonably be expected to affect the price of the company s securities.
75679_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	Not use material, non-public information gained in the course of conducting GCI business from another publicly-traded company (including customers, vendors, business partners, competitors, etc.) to trade in the securities of that company.
75679_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	Not provide material, non-public information as described above to any person outside of the company other than for GCI business purposes and subject to appropriate safeguards.
75679_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	Follow company guidance establishing black-out periods, during which trading in GCI securities is prohibited by those employees possessing material, non-public information about or related to a specific scheduled or anticipated event, such as a large acquisition or quarterly earnings report.
75679_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	Notify a supervisor in the event that such material, non-public information exists but no company guidance has been given.
75679_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	Note that automated or programmed purchases, such as a 401(k) investment plan, are not typically prohibited during a black-out.
75679_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	GCI s officers and directors have additional obligations with regard to trading in GCI s securities.
75679_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	We each have the responsibility to properly use and protect company property and to keep company and customer information confidential.
75679_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	Our physical assets include communication networks and equipment; IT (information technology) systems and equipment; buildings; furniture and other furnishings; office supplies; tools; vehicles; inventory; cash; and desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
75679_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	Our non-physical assets include customer information; our internally developed technology and software; our brands, trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property; externally developed technology and software that we purchase/license from vendors; contractual rights; company business plans, financial models, and other financial information; and financial resources such as bank accounts and P-Cards.
75679_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	Company property is critical to our ability to do business and makes up a substantial part of GCI s overall value.
75679_18_ITEM15_P158_S1	If we are not good stewards of company property, we reduce our ability to fulfill the Company Mission of creating value for our customers, opportunities for our employees, and growth for our investors.
75679_18_ITEM15_P158_S2	Each of us as employees must properly use and protect company property.
75679_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	Use company property only for GCI business, and not for personal advantage and not to compete with GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P159_S1	In accordance with company policy, incidental use of handsets and laptops for personal matters is permitted.
75679_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	Keep company property in good working condition.
75679_18_ITEM15_P161_S0	Be alert to situations that could lead to the waste, loss, damage, misuse, theft, or unauthorized use/disclosure of company property and report such situations to a supervisor.
75679_18_ITEM15_P162_S0	Take appropriate steps to secure company property.
75679_18_ITEM15_P162_S1	Lock doors, file cabinets, and vehicles when appropriate.
75679_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	Not share or exchange company property outside the company other than for GCI business purposes and subject to appropriate safeguards.
75679_18_ITEM15_P164_S0	Maintain the confidentiality of all company or customer information entrusted to us by GCI, except when disclosure is authorized or mandated by law.
75679_18_ITEM15_P164_S1	Consult with the General Counsel/Legal Department before making such disclosure.
75679_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	Treat all employees with respect, maintain constructive relationships, and be vigilant about safety.
75679_18_ITEM15_P166_S0	Our Declaration of Principles states that we should respect . . .
75679_18_ITEM15_P166_S1	the efforts of each person and recognize . .
75679_18_ITEM15_P166_S2	that each individual makes a valuable contribution to the success of the Company.
75679_18_ITEM15_P166_S3	Our Basic Principles urge us to maintain constructive relationships with our co-workers.
75679_18_ITEM15_P166_S4	Maintaining a productive, respectful, and safe work environment is essential to maintaining a fast, efficient, and innovative GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	Each of us as employees must strive to:
75679_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	Use the Declaration of Principles and the Basic Principles as the guide for our daily conduct in the workplace.
75679_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	Comply with company policies on equal employment opportunity and prohibited harassment in the workplace.
75679_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	Take personal ownership of work environment safety, participate in safety training, and apply that safety training and general good judgment on the job.
75679_18_ITEM15_P170_S1	None of us should tolerate even a single instance of unsafe behavior or unsafe conditions on the job.
75679_18_ITEM15_P171_S0	Employees who create and maintain records in connection with their work must do so accurately and truthfully.
75679_18_ITEM15_P172_S0	Maintaining accurate business records is critical to running our business.
75679_18_ITEM15_P172_S1	It is also essential to complying with laws and regulations governing publicly traded companies, communications providers, and companies in general.
75679_18_ITEM15_P173_S0	For example, GCI must file full, fair, accurate, and timely financial reports and other documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and comply with other laws and regulations that govern our communications to our investors/lenders and the general public and promote transparency in financial markets.
75679_18_ITEM15_P174_S0	Those of us employees who are responsible for creating and maintaining business records (including those who approve or certify those records) must:
75679_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	Accurately create and maintain the business records determined by management to be necessary to serve GCI s customers, run GCI s business effectively and efficiently, and meet GCI s contractual and legal obligations, particularly to the SEC and the Federal Communications Commission.
75679_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	Maintain all of the Company s books, records, accounts and financial statements in reasonable detail so that they accurately reflect GCI s business transactions and conform both to applicable legal requirements and to GCI s system of internal controls.
75679_18_ITEM15_P177_S0	Assure that GCI s public reports are full, fair, accurate, and understandable, and upon request, provide prompt, accurate answers to inquiries related to GCI s public disclosure requirements.
75679_18_ITEM15_P178_S0	Be truthful in our accounting practices and take no action intended to improperly influence GCI s auditors.
75679_18_ITEM15_P179_S0	Report suspected illegal or unethical behavior related to accounting, internal controls on accounting, or audit matters via the Audit Committee Anonymous Hotline or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
75679_18_ITEM15_P180_S0	Report only the true and actual number of hours worked when entering time in GCI s payroll system.
75679_18_ITEM15_P180_S1	Similarly, report only the true amount of expenses when applying for reimbursement.
75679_18_ITEM15_P181_S0	Maintain or destroy records only according to applicable department or business unit record retention policies.
75679_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	Any questions regarding implementation and carrying out of these obligations are to be referred to a supervisor, the Chief Financial Officer, or General Counsel/Legal Department.
75679_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	Adhere to all applicable governmental laws, ordinances, and regulations in jurisdictions in which GCI does business.
75679_18_ITEM15_P183_S1	Stay informed of the requirements that apply.
75679_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	GCI is a publicly traded company operating in a regulated industry and is obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
75679_18_ITEM15_P184_S1	These legal obligations include, but are not limited to, federal and state telecommunications regulations, workplace provisions, environmental laws, and other federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and related regulations applicable to GCI s operations.
75679_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	In particular, GCI is committed to compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws.
75679_18_ITEM15_P185_S1	Under no circumstances may we attempt to achieve a business objective through means of a bribe or other improper action, including impermissible gifts to federal, state, and local government officials.
75679_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	Violations of anti-corruption laws can expose GCI (and any employee involved) to lawsuits, substantial fines, and even criminal charges.
75679_18_ITEM15_P186_S1	In addition, the Federal Communications Commission has established strict rules and policies prohibiting gifts from service providers to employees of applicants (for example, school districts, libraries, and rural health care providers) to the E-Rate and Rural Health Care Programs.
75679_18_ITEM15_P186_S2	Violations of these rules could result in significant penalties, including fines and loss of program eligibility.
75679_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a federal law that prohibits bribes to foreign government officials (including officials of international organizations, political parties, and employees of international state-owned or state-controlled enterprises) in order to influence their acts or decisions.
75679_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	Under the FCPA, a bribe can be cash, gifts, products, trips, or anything else of value.
75679_18_ITEM15_P187_S2	The FCPA carries substantial civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for noncompliance.
75679_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	At this time GCI conducts minimal activities in foreign countries.
75679_18_ITEM15_P188_S1	Employees who work on international projects or other business activities, including overseas travel, should seek additional guidance from the General Counsel/Legal Department on the requirements of the FCPA and international anti-corruption laws in advance of such activities.
75679_18_ITEM15_P188_S2	No business may be transacted outside of the United States without prior consultation with, and the approval of, the General Counsel.
75679_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	In summary, we as employees must never authorize, offer, promise, or give (either directly or indirectly) bribes or take other improper action to persuade or influence anyone outside GCI to achieve a business objective.
75679_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	GCI and its management and Board of Directors are committed to open discussion of GCI s business conduct and ethical practices.
75679_18_ITEM15_P190_S1	All employees are encouraged to express their ideas and concerns about these issues.
75679_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	us as employees have questions about this Code or how it applies to our work, we can contact our supervisor, or any of the sources listed below (each a "Guiding Authority").
75679_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	If an employee has reason to believe that another employee has violated the Code, or is asked to violate the Code, that employee has a duty to GCI to report the incident.
75679_18_ITEM15_P192_S1	Failure to report a violation is, in itself, a violation of the Code.
75679_18_ITEM15_P192_S2	The employee may report confidentially through normal reporting lines or any Guiding Authority.
75679_18_ITEM15_P192_S3	Anonymous reporting also is available to any Guiding Authority, including through reports made using the Business Code Ethics Hotline, the Audit Committee Anonymous Hotline (related to accounting, internal controls on accounting, or audit matters), or Anonymous Messages.
75679_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	Whether the employee identifies himself or herself or not, the report will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible.
75679_18_ITEM15_P193_S1	Business Code Ethics Hotline and Audit Committee Anonymous Hotline reports are received by an independent company, which reports the information to GCI management for investigation and response.
75679_18_ITEM15_P193_S2	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews reports and their resolution when related to accounting, internal accounting controls, and auditing.
75679_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	All of us as employees need to remember that there is no valid reason for violating the Code.
75679_18_ITEM15_P194_S1	It doesn t matter whether our supervisor or some other member of management asks us to violate the Code or tells us that a violation of the Code is okay because it benefits GCI.
75679_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	No employee will be reprimanded for coming forward with a good faith report regarding a Code violation.
75679_18_ITEM15_P195_S1	GCI will not tolerate retaliation against such employees.
75679_18_ITEM15_P195_S2	They play a crucial role in maintaining an ethical workplace at GCI as well as in protecting GCI shareholder value.
75679_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	In consultation with a Guiding Authority, an individual or team of individuals with appropriate expertise will be designated to conduct a complete, fair, and prompt review of a reported violation of the Code.
75679_18_ITEM15_P196_S1	The review will typically involve an examination of relevant communications and documents, interviews of individuals with knowledge of the alleged violation, a legal analysis, and recommendations concerning appropriate follow-up action (including changes in policies and procedures).
75679_18_ITEM15_P196_S2	All employees are required to cooperate in investigations of violations of the Code.
75679_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	Where a violation is found to have occurred, follow-up action may include disciplinary action for the employee who violated the Code.
75679_18_ITEM15_P197_S1	Discipline, if any, will vary with the seriousness and frequency of the violation, and will take into account all of the facts and mitigating factors.
75679_18_ITEM15_P197_S2	In serious cases, however, disciplinary action could include termination.
75679_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	Any waiver of the provisions of this Code for executive officers and outside directors may be made only by the Board of Directors and must be promptly disclosed to GCI s shareholders.
75679_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	The disclosure must include an identification of the person who received the waiver, the date of grant of the waiver by the Board, and a brief description of the circumstances and reasons under which it was given.
