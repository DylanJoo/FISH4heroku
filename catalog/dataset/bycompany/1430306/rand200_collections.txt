1430306_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Tamandare Explorations was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 16, 2007 to engage in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We are an exploration stage company with no revenues and a limited operating history.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The principal executive offices are located at 23046 Avenida de la Carlota, Suite 600, Laguna Hills, CA 92653.

1430306_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Cash provided by financing activities for the period from inception (November 16, 2007) through December 31, 2010 was $75,000, of which $15,000 was from the sale of 3,000,000 shares of common stock to a director of the company for $0.005 per share, $50,000 represents stock subscriptions received from our "all or nothing" offering that was completed on October 8, 2008 and $10,000 in a loan from a related party.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our financial statements from inception (November 16, 2007) through the year ended December 31, 2010 report no revenues and a net loss of $70,681.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Tamandare Explorations Inc. which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We carried out exploration on the Que 1-4 property located in the west central area of the State of Nevada, soutwest of the Town of Tonopah.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Phase 1 was completed in December 2008 at a cost of $8,500.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	In April 2009 further fill-in MMI sampling was carried out at a cost of $9,500.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	Based on the findings the company decided to abandon the property and is now investigating other opportunities to best utilize our remaining capital.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	This may include procuring another mineral property for exploration.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	We do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from any of our exploration properties as we will hold all interest and rights to the claims.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of gold, silver and other minerals.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Therefore, we will likely be able to sell any minerals that we are able to recover.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We are subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as dynamite, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators that we will need to conduct exploration.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	In the future if we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to do so.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.

1430306_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly, time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	Future legislation may significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P12_S5	Such legislation, as well as further interpretation of existing laws in the United States, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and delays, interruptions, or a termination of operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P12_S6	Environmental problems known to exist at this time in the United States may not be in compliance with regulations that may come into existence in the future.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P12_S7	This may have a substantial impact upon the capital expenditures required of us in order to deal with such problem and could substantially reduce earnings.
1430306_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The regulatory bodies that directly regulate our exploration activities are the Bureau of Land Management (Federal) and the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (State).
1430306_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We have no current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts.

1430306_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	Section 15(g) also imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny securities.
1430306_11_ITEM5_P8_S1	These rules require a one page summary of certain essential items.

1430306_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	We do not have any equity compensation plans and accordingly we have no securities authorized for issuance thereunder.
1430306_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	There were no shares of common stock or other securities issued to the issuer or affiliated purchasers during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are still in our exploration stage and have generated no revenues to date.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We incurred operating expenses of $17,724 and $30,867 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	These expenses consisted of general operating expenses and professional fees incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our required reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

1430306_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our deficit accumulated during the exploration stage was $70,681.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We have sold $65,000 in equity securities to date.

1430306_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our cash balance at December 31, 2010 was $4,624 with $10,305 in outstanding liabilities.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Of the outstanding liabilities there is $10,000 in a loan from a related party.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Management does not believe our current cash balance will sustain operations for the next twelve months.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	We are an exploration stage company and have generated no revenue to date.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern basis.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company had limited operations during the period from November 16, 2007 (date of inception) to December 31, 2010 and generated a net loss of $70,681.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Because the Company is currently in the exploration stage and has minimal expenses, management believes that the company's current cash may not to cover the expenses they will incur during the next twelve months.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to secure a new property for exploration or other potential business opportunities that might be available to the Company.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	There can be no assurances that we will be able to secure a new property for exploration or find other available business opportunities, nor can there be any certainties of the business industry of the opportunity that might be available nor any indication of the financial resources required of any possible business opportunity.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	If we are unable to secure another property for exploration or alternatively, find another business opportunity, our shareholders will lose some or all of their investment and our business will likely fail.
1430306_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tamandare Explorations Inc. (a development stage company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related Statements of expenses, stockholders' equity , and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the period from inception (November 16, 2007) through December 31, 2010.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of Tamandare Explorations Inc.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tamandare Explorations Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the period from inception to December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Tamandare Explorations Inc. will continue as a going concern.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Tamandare Explorations Inc. has a working capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	Tamandare Explorations Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on November 16, 2007.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	Tamandare's principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	Tamandare is in the process of acquiring a series of mining claims for exploration.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P12_S2	Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an "as if converted" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P12_S3	For the period through December 31, 2010, there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, Tamandare considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, cash consisted of funds in the Tamandare's bank account.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Tamandare has been in the exploration stage since its formation on November 16, 2007 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	It is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Mineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P15_S3	When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P15_S4	Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P15_S5	If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Tamandare recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	Tamandare provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Tamandare does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on their results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies Tamandare will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Tamandare has never generated revenues since inception and is unlikely to generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The continuation of Tamandare as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of Tamandare to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Tamandare has accumulated losses since inception.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	These factors raise substantial doubt regarding Tamandare's ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should Tamandare be unable to continue as a going concern.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Tamandare uses the liability method, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	During fiscal 2010, Tamandare incurred a net loss and, therefore, has no tax liability.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P21_S3	The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is $70,681 at December 31, 2010, and will expire through 2030.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, deferred tax assets consisted of the following:
1430306_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Between June 1, 2010 and September 30, 2010 the Company paid a director $500 per month for use of office space and services.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	During the quarter from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 the Company paid Mark Lawson, the sole officer and director at the time, $4,000 for consulting fees.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	David Moss, the current sole officer and director of the Company may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities as they become available, he may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and his other business opportunities.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.
1430306_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	$10,000 is payable to David Moss for advances made to the Company, this amount has no terms of repayment, it is unsecured, bears no interest and is due on demand.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	- Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; - Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and - Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2010 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	such internal controls and procedures were not effective.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2010.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Corporation's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Corporation's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Corporation to provide only the management's report in this annual report.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by December 31, 2011.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Additionally, we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies by December 31, 2011.
1430306_11_ITEM9A_P14_S0	There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

1430306_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	In connection with the Annual Report of Tamandare Explorations Inc.

1430306_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and result of operations of the Company.
1430306_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this certification as of the 1st day of March, 2011.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION, THEREFORE THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATING activities.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As such we may have to cease activities and investors could lose their investment.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	BECAUSE THE PROBABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL PROSPECT EVER HAVING RESERVES IS EXTREMELY REMOTE, ANY FUNDS SPENT ON EXPLORATION WILL PROBABLY BE LOST.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves is extremely remote.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In all probability any property we carry out exploration on may not contain any reserves.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	As such, any funds spent on exploration will probably be lost.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NO TECHNICAL TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE IN EXPLORING FOR, STARTING, AND OPERATING AN EXPLORATION PROGRAM.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	MANAGEMENT'S DECISIONS AND CHOICES MAY NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT STANDARD ENGINEERING OR MANAGERIAL APPROACHES MINERAL EXPLORATION COMPANIES COMMONLY USE.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	AS A RESULT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE ACTIVITIES.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our management has limited experience with exploring for, starting, and operating an exploration program.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Further, our management has no direct training or experience in these areas and as a result may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements related to working within the industry.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Management's decisions and choices may not take into account standard engineering or managerial approaches mineral exploration companies commonly use.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Consequently our activities, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management's lack of experience in this industry.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE LOSSES WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	AS A RESULT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE ACTIVITIES.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We were incorporated in November 2007 and we have not started our proposed business activities or realized any revenues.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our net loss was $70,681 from inception to December 31, 2010.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	* our ability to locate a profitable mineral property * our ability to generate revenues * our ability to reduce exploration costs.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This will happen because there are expenses associated with the research and exploration of mineral properties.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, we may not generate revenues in the future.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Failure to generate revenues will cause us to suspend or cease activities.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DANGERS INVOLVED IN MINERAL EXPLORATION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY INCUR LIABILITY OR DAMAGES, WHICH COULD HURT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND POSSIBLY RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF OUR BUSINESS.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, WE MAY HAVE TO LIMIT OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITY.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our exploration activity.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As such we may not be able to complete an exploration program that is as thorough as we would like.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In that event, an existing reserve may go undiscovered.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Without a reserve, we cannot generate revenues.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	WE MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS WE NEED TO BEGIN EXPLORATION WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO DELAY OR SUSPEND ACTIVITIES.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies, such as dynamite, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators that we might need to conduct exploration.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we cannot find the products and equipment we need, we will have to suspend future exploration plans until we do find the products and equipment we need.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	BECAUSE OUR OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING 10% OF HIS TIME OR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HOURS PER WEEK TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF EXPLORATION.
1430306_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Because our officer and director has other outside business activities and will only be devoting 10% of his time or four hours per week to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to our officer and director.
1430306_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We do not currently own any property.
1430306_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our offices are located at 23046 Avenida de la Carlota, Suite 600, Laguna Hills, CA 92653.
1430306_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Management believes the current premises are sufficient for its needs at this time.
1430306_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We currently have no investment policies as they pertain to real estate, real estate interests or real estate mortgages.
1430306_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or potential legal actions.
1430306_11_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On November 22, 2010, in a private transaction, David J. Moss purchases 3,000,000 shares of the company's common stock from Roger Gebert, a former officer and director of the Company.

1430306_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the accounts of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. ( Tonix ) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as follows, collectively referred to as we , us or the Company : Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Tonix Sub ) and Krele LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Krele ).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Tonix Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tonix and Krele is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	We were incorporated on November 16, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Tamandare Explorations Inc. From inception through October 2011, we were involved in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties in the State of Nevada.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	On October 7, 2011 ( Closing Date and the closing of the share exchange transaction, the Closing ), we executed and consummated a share exchange agreement by and among Tonix Sub and the stockholders of 100% of the equity securities of Tonix Sub, including, the holders of 5,207,500 shares of common stock, 1,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 2,275,527 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the Tonix Shareholders ), on the one hand, and us and David Moss ( Moss ), our then sole officer and director and majority shareholder, on the other hand (the Share Exchange Agreement and the transaction, the Share Exchange ).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	In the Share Exchange, the Tonix Shareholders exchanged their shares of Tonix Sub for newly issued shares of our common stock ( Common Stock ).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	As a result, upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Shareholders received an aggregate of 22,666,667 shares of our Common Stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Moss returned 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock to us, which were retired, and our existing stockholders retained 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	The 22,666,667 shares issued to the Tonix Shareholders constituted approximately 85% of our 26,666,667 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock post-Closing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	As a result of the Share Exchange, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Tonix Sub and consequently, control of the business and operations of Tonix Sub and Krele.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	From and after the Closing Date of the Share Exchange, our primary operations consist of the business and operations of Tonix Sub and Krele.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	On October 11, 2011, we changed our name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. to reflect our new business.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 1996, Seth Lederman, MD, and Donald Landry, MD, PhD, formed L L Technologies, LLC, ( L L ), to develop medications for central nervous system ( CNS ) conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Dr. Lederman is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Landry is a Director.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	L L was a founder of Janus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., later renamed Vela Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ( Vela ), which developed various therapeutics, including a very low dose, or VLD, version of cyclobenzaprine, under an agreement with L L. Vela decided to focus its resources on other programs and transferred the rights in VLD cyclobenzaprine and certain other technologies to L L in March 2006.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Dr. Lederman is managing partner of Plumbline.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Plumbline possessed rights to certain technology for the treatment of alcohol dependence and abuse.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	In connection with founding Tonix Sub, L L and Plumbline entered into an intellectual property transfer and assignment agreement with Tonix Sub for the purpose of assigning patents and transferring intellectual property and know-how in exchange for shares of common stock of Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	As a result of economic conditions related to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, Tonix Sub was not successful in raising money to fund its programs until 2009.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	As a result, Tonix Sub was unable to advance the development programs and had little activity except for prosecuting and maintaining patents and maintaining contracts.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation to analyze the sleep data from the 2001 Phase 2a study of 36 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome, or FM (the Moldofsky Study ), who were treated with bedtime VLD cyclobenzaprine or placebo.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Moldofsky Study was conducted in Canada by the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation, and Tonix Sub obtained the data from this study from L L.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	( Caliper ) to analyze the interactions of cyclobenzaprine with certain receptors.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	In June 2010, Tonix Sub entered into consulting agreements with L L and Lederman Co, LLC ( Lederman Co ) and also acquired certain rights to develop isometheptene mucate as a treatment for certain types of headaches from Lederman Co., which we are developing as TNX-201.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Dr. Lederman is managing partner of Lederman Co. Between June 2010 and October 2011, Tonix Sub was active in recruiting new officers and directors and started dosing normal healthy volunteers for the pharmacokinetic trial for TNX-102.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Lederman Co predominantly provides us with clinical development expertise.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	L L predominantly provides us with scientific development expertise.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Relative to traditional pharmaceutical development companies, we can be considered a virtual company, since we contract with third-party vendors to provide many functions that are core to traditional pharmaceutical companies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	For example, we have contracted with PharmaNet Canada, Inc., or PharmaNet Canada, to develop methods for analyzing cyclobenzaprine in the blood and to conduct a human clinical study to evaluate the performance of our formulation technology.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P17_S4	Lederman Co is responsible for overseeing the scientific and technical aspects of PharmaNet s contract work product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	In July 2010, Tonix Sub changed its name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	In August 2010, Tonix Sub formed Krele.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing new pharmaceutical products for CNS conditions that may be safer and more effective than currently available treatments.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We use ongoing advances in science and medicine to search for potential therapeutic solutions among already existing prescription pharmaceutical agents that have been successfully used in patients for other conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	We create new dose formulations for these agents with the intent to developing products that are optimized for the new therapeutic uses or indications that we target.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our projects are in the development phase, and we currently do not market any products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The process of taking a new drug formulation from concept through testing to approval for a new indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) is a time-consuming, costly and high-risk process.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Once a drug formulation has been tested in laboratories, we need to conduct clinical trials of the product candidate to test its uptake into the blood stream, elimination, effectiveness and safety.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Neither laboratory nor animal studies predict the properties of drugs in humans, so designing new formulations can result in a large number of unpredictable outcomes.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The first set of clinical trials, which are sometimes referred to as Phase 1 studies, are performed by administering new drug formulations to a limited number of healthy human volunteers and are designed to test the initial concept of the drug formulation and to determine the correct dosage to be tested subsequently on patients affected with the target disorder.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	The initial Phase 1 studies can take up to a year to complete, however, since we reformulate versions of approved drugs for new uses, we may need to devote less time to Phase I studies since our testing is informed by significant prior human research that we believe allows us to reduce the possible outcomes.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	The next step in the process is to conduct a larger study in which the new drug formulation is administered to human patients affected with the targeted disorder, which can be referred to as a first pivotal study, a Phase 2b study or a Phase 3 study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	The first pivotal study for a condition like FM typically takes a year to complete and then several more months to interpret the data.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	If the first pivotal study proves the drug is effective and safe, then a second pivotal study is conducted, which can also be referred to as a Phase 3 study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	The second pivotal study for a condition like FM would typically take 18 months to complete.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	After the second pivotal study is completed, and if the results are deemed a success, we would then submit an application to the FDA seeking approval of the new drug product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	This application is called a New Drug Application, or NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S5	We believe it would take approximately three months to file the FDA application and another 14 months for FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S6	The drug could be marketed shortly after FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P23_S7	Therefore, it typically takes more than five years to bring a new formulation of a drug to market for a new indication, and any delays in the process, such as lack of capital necessary to run clinical trials, unexpected results, adverse effects, or difficulty in recruiting willing subjects for trials, would result in additional time before a drug could be available for sale.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our lead product candidate, TNX-102, is a new optimized dosage form of cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	TNX-102 is being developed for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	FM is a CNS condition that is characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, increased pain sensitivity, fatigue and disturbed sleep.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Cyclobenzaprine is the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two FDA approved and widely prescribed muscle relaxant products: Flexeril , an immediate-release form, marketed by the McNeil Specialty Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson Johnson, and Amrix , a controlled release form marketed by Cephalon.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Generic copies of Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine in the immediate-release form) are available and many patients receive a generic when their physician prescribes Flexeril.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	Likewise, generic copies of Amrix are also available.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	According to a study conducted by Frost Sullivan on our behalf relating to the FM market in the United States ( Frost and Sullivan ), the immediate-release dose form of cyclobenzaprine is widely used off-label to treat FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	We are working to optimize the dose and formulation of TNX-102 to treat FM safely and effectively.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We plan to subject TNX-102 to the strict testing required for FDA approval, which we believe will take at least four years and significant clinical studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	We have conducted an initial study of TNX-102 and are currently undertaking a comparative pharmacokinetic and bioavailability study, of which the clinical phase was completed by the end of 2011, and the analysis of the subjects blood samples will be completed in the first half of 2012.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P27_S4	If TNX-102 is ultimately approved by the FDA for the management of FM, we believe it will be adopted by physicians and reimbursed by managed care companies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our other leading product candidate, TNX-105, which we are also developing, is a new dose form of cyclobenzaprine to treat symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that begins in the aftermath of traumatic experiences.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	Sleep disturbances, including nightmares and insomnia, are core features of PTSD and are included in two of the three main symptom clusters.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	Patients with PTSD may have any single or combination of symptoms that include re-experiencing, emotional numbing and avoidance, and hyperarousal reactions that persist for more than one month after the traumatic event.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P28_S4	PTSD shares several features with FM, and some patients are believed to suffer from both PTSD and FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Cyclobenzaprine is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of our lead product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	We are utilizing drug delivery technology to produce new formulations.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	In addition to cyclobenzaprine, each formulation of TNX-102 and TNX-105 will contain inactive ingredients, called excipients that are well-characterized and have been FDA approved previously in other products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	As a result, we anticipate seeking FDA marketing approval of our lead product candidates, TNX-102 and TNX-105, through the NDA process under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FFDCA, which we also refer to as Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	This process permits the FDA to make some safety and effectiveness determinations through review of materials in the public domain or in already approved NDAs of products containing cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S5	This approach would spare us some of the burden of generating all of this data for ourselves and may allow our lead product candidates to progress through a shorter development pathway than is typical for pharmaceutical products based on novel active ingredients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P29_S6	We have not filed an NDA for either of our lead product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We also have a pipeline of several other product candidates that we are constantly evaluating.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	For example, we are developing TNX-201, which is a treatment for certain types of headaches and TNX-301, which is a potential treatment for alcohol dependence and addiction.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	For commercial reasons, we normally do not disclose the identities of the active ingredients or targeted indications of products in our pipeline until a U.S. patent has been allowed.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Consistent with our mission, these product candidates are, or likely will be, reformulations of active ingredients that have been used by patients in other FDA-approved products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	We anticipate that some of our other pipeline products will be submitted to the FDA for approval under Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	In other cases, we expect that the products will be formulated to match earlier predicate products closely enough to rely, in part, on their regulatory review and status.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	There may be instances where the predicate product is a medicine that was reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the National Academy of Sciences under the Drug Evaluation and Safety Initiative, or DESI, and would be considered by the FDA to be an unapproved product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	For DESI products, it is our intent also to develop NDA versions by modernizing the chemistry, manufacturing and controls and to perform new clinical studies to support an NDA filing under Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Because of our size and being in the development stage, we do not currently devote a significant amount of time or resources towards our other pipeline candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We anticipate that sometime in 2012 we will begin developing formulations for TNX-201 and possibly TNX-301, but do not expect to start clinical trials until 2013 at the earliest.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Krele s mission is to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate NDA products or existing marketed products that it may acquire from other pharmaceutical companies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We expect that Tonix Sub s relationship to Krele will be similar to that of several other pharmaceutical companies and their subsidiaries that market generic versions of the parent s branded products at different periods in their product life-cycle.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We anticipate that when one of our branded products loses patent protection, Krele may market generic versions of it.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	In such instances, Krele s product would be an authorized generic and would rely on our NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	Krele may also develop or acquire generic products approved under Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs ).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	For ANDAs, the predicate product is a medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ) under an NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S6	Tonix Sub may market branded versions of such products that rely on Krele s ANDAs which would be referred to as branded generics.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S7	We do not currently market any products and have only begun the process of obtaining state licenses, which are legally required before a company can manufacture, distribute and market prescription medications.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P34_S8	Krele has been issued a state license in New York.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat CNS conditions, including FM and PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	The principal components of our strategy to achieve this objective are to:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	enter into collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies with respect to, among others, our FM and PTSD product candidates and other products that will benefit from development or marketing resources beyond those in our Company.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Pursue development and regulatory approval pathways .
1430306_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	We believe our lead product candidates may be approvable under pathways that are potentially shorter than those typically available for drug products based on novel active ingredients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	By focusing on developing new formulations of approved drugs for new uses, we believe that we will be able to use the Section 505(b)(2) pathway for FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	This pathway can reduce the time and expense required for our development programs by allowing our use of previously-generated safety and efficacy information regarding the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our lead product candidates to support the filing and approval of our NDA application.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	Doing so may help reduce the size and scope of our preclinical and clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	The FDA has strict requirements on the marketing of drugs, and FDA approves each drug for specific uses which are called the label indications.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	The use of a drug product for the treatment of a condition other than one of its approved label indications is called off-label use.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	The development of an existing FDA-approved drug for the treatment of a condition other than one of its approved label indications is considered a new use .
1430306_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	For companies involved in the ethical development and marketing of prescription drugs in the US, FDA approval of a new use or new label indication is the only legal basis of marketing claims.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P38_S4	Off-label use is not recognized by the FDA or FDA-regulated companies as a new use.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	We are pursuing a two-pronged patent strategy by seeking intellectual property protection for our methods of use for certain known active pharmaceutical ingredients and by seeking patents to protect the formulation technologies we employ.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	With respect to the methods of use patents, we believe the therapeutic uses we target are new uses for these active ingredients and we have been issued patents directed to certain aspects of our new uses.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	We are seeking additional patents to cover other new uses.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	For example, the invention of bedtime VLD cyclobenzaprine as a treatment for FM was novel and unexpected when our patents were filed in 2000.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	With respect to formulation patents, we believe our products will be protected by patents that describe inventions of technology for making new formulations and possibly also by patents that describe the invention of products that achieve novel and useful blood levels at certain times after administration.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Provide clear value propositions to third-party payors to merit reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	We are designing our clinical development programs to demonstrate compelling competitive advantages to patients and prescribers and also to demonstrate value propositions to third-party payors.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	We believe TNX-102 might help in the management of FM by reducing pain and other symptoms, such as fatigue.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	In addition, we believe that bedtime treatment with TNX-102 will have fewer day time side-effects than off-label bedtime treatment with immediate release cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	For FM, we believe an FDA-approved product would capture some of the off-label use of generic cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S5	Because FDA approvals are based on objective data, we believe that third-party payors will provide reimbursement for an FDA approved product, even at a premium price relative to other drugs that are used off-label, such as immediate-release cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, baclofen, carisoprodol or metaxalone.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P40_S6	For example, third-party payors reimburse for using FDA approved Lyrica and Cymbalta for fibromyalgia over off-label generic versions of Neurontin (gabapentin) and generic anti-depressants, respectively.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Enter into collaborations to maximize the value of our technology .
1430306_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	We believe certain of our drug development candidates, including TNX-102 and TNX-105, can be developed and marketed more effectively by companies that already have significant drug development and marketing capabilities.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	We will seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of these product candidates at the times we believe most effective.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our lead product candidates are TNX-102, for the treatment of FM and TNX-105 for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Both of these consist of cyclobenzaprine in a mixture of inactive ingredients that are called excipients , which we believe will improve the absorption rate of cyclobenzaprine in ways that will optimize the product for bedtime treatment.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Cyclobenzaprine was first synthesized in 1961 by Merck, and the 10 mg Flexeril immediate-release dose form was FDA approved in 1977 for the relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Although a number of clinical studies have addressed the potential use and benefit of cyclobenzaprine in treating symptoms of FM, to our knowledge these studies have not motivated a sponsor to pursue FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Based on cyclobenzaprine s safety and efficacy for treating muscle spasm, in the 1990s, Merck conducted studies to support an application to market a 5 mg Flexeril tablet (low dose) for the over-the-counter, or OTC, market, where patients can purchase medicine without a physician s prescription.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	Although Merck s studies re-affirmed the safety and demonstrated efficacy of 5 mg Flexeril in several large trials, the OTC division of the FDA rejected the application for use without a prescription, apparently, we believe, because muscle spasm was deemed a condition that required a physician to diagnose and supervise treatment.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Merck divested the Flexeril franchise to Alza Pharmaceuticals, or Alza.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	Alza subsequently was acquired by Johnson and Johnson and Flexeril is part of their McNeil Specialty Pharmaceuticals division.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	Based largely on the Merck studies, McNeil won approval of Flexeril 5 mg tablets as a prescription medicine to treat muscle spasm.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	McNeil promoted Flexeril 5 mg tablets for the three year period of market exclusivity based on The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, generally referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	Following this exclusivity period, several generics entered the market and took market share from Flexeril.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	McNeil continues to manufacture Flexeril, but we believe McNeil no longer actively promotes it.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Despite the approved uses of cyclobenzaprine in treating muscle spasm, we believe current marketed formulations of cyclobenzaprine are limited for treating FM by unpredictable absorption.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	As described in the Flexeril package insert, the amount of cyclobenzaprine absorbed into the bloodstream varies between 33-55% of the dose ingested.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	The variability in absorption may be due to several factors, including effects of the stomach pH (acidity or base) on the dissolution of the tablets, as well as the context of either an empty stomach or a recent meal.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	Food in the stomach and small intestine from a recent meal contributes to variability in absorbing other drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	The uncertainties in absorption rates make it challenging for a physician contemplating a bedtime treatment for FM to ensure the intended therapeutic effect is achieved without risking side effects like next-day drowsiness, which could result if the patient has too much cyclobenzaprine remaining in the bloodstream the next day.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	If a product could deliver a predictable absorption rate of cyclobenzaprine, it would mean patients would be less likely to receive too little drug to receive a therapeutic effect.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Conversely, patients would be less likely to be over-dosed, which might lead to potential side effects, including next-day drowsiness.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	An optimal VLD cyclobenzaprine product could have faster absorption, faster clearance and more predictable effects than the immediate release tablet format.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	We are testing a number of technologies to optimize the properties of TNX-102 for FM and TNX-105 for PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	One of the technologies we are testing is a novel gelatin capsule (gelcap) that employs a proprietary mixture of lipids with cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	The proprietary lipid mixture is designed to increase the rate and efficiency of absorption of cyclobenzaprine from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	This formulation is expected to result in increased dosage precision.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P51_S4	However, the science of formulating drugs is not sufficiently advanced to predict the performance of the new gelcaps or other formulation technologies in humans.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P51_S5	We will only learn if our design has advantageous properties when we conclude testing of TNX-102 in human subjects.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	TNX-102, our most advanced product candidate, is a bedtime pill containing VLD cyclobenzaprine (2.4 mg).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	The development of TNX-102 is supported by the results of the Moldofsky Study of VLD cyclobenzaprine in FM patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	A version of TNX-102 has been manufactured in small quantities for use in human clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Based on our formulation of TNX-102, we are testing whether it will provide more predictable effects and decreased risk of next-day drowsiness than commercially available immediate-release cyclobenzaprine tablets.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	We are testing a variety of technologies for faster and more efficient absorption relative to currently marketed cyclobenzaprine products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	FM is diagnosed by groups of symptoms that have been defined by committees of the American College of Rheumatology, or ACR, and a committee of experts from the organization Outcome Measures in Rheumatology.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	In 2007, Pfizer s Lyrica (pregabalin) became the first medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	In 2008, Eli Lilly s Cymbalta (duloxetine) became the second medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	In 2009, Savella (milnacipran) was the third medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Savella is marketed by Forest Laboratories.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our motivation to focus our efforts on developing TNX-102 for FM stems from the results of a clinical study on 36 patients in 2001, the related rights to which we acquired from L L. Specifically, this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating eight week trial conducted at two study centers.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	The study subjects met ACR criteria for FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Patients received VLD cyclobenzaprine immediate-release 1 mg capsules or corresponding placebo capsules to ingest after dinner and before bedtime.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	Initially, patients took one capsule each evening, but over the course of the study, they were allowed to increase the number of tablets taken in increments of one capsule per week.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	The maximum number of capsules allowed was four per evening, which would be a total dose of 4 mg immediate-release cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Patients treated with VLD cyclobenzaprine demonstrated significant improvements in pain, fatigue and tenderness at week 8 relative to baseline whereas, placebo-treated patients did not improve (Figure 1).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Although this study excluded patients who met formal criteria for major depressive disorder or any anxiety disorder, there is a high degree of co-existing symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	VLD cyclobenzaprine treatment resulted in significant reductions in total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, or HAD, which measures symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the HAD depression subscale which measures depressive symptoms (Figure 1).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	This study showed treatment with VLD cyclobenzaprine:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or discontinuations due to adverse events, or AEs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	We have conducted a human clinical study being conducted by a contract research organization, or CRO, under an US Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, and a Canadian Clinical Trial Application.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	We received FDA and Health Canada clearance for this study, which was conducted in Canada.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	This study will determine the blood levels of cyclobenzaprine in approximately 30 healthy adult volunteers after they ingest either TNX-102, a candidate gelcap formulation containing low-dose cyclobenzaprine or a currently marketed, immediate-release cyclobenzaprine product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Studies that measure the blood levels of drugs over time are called pharmacokinetic studies .
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	The TNX-102 formulation is being tested in subjects who are either fasting or recently fed.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	This study seeks to measure the circulating blood levels of cyclobenzaprine after oral administration of the TNX-102 candidate formulation in a fed or fasting state and determine how they compare to the blood levels resulting from oral administration of the currently marketed product in a fasting state.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	Each subject receives each of the trial doses and conditions in a random order, in what is called a crossover study design.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S4	The crossover design allows the assessment of the variability of drug blood levels over time in the same people during each phase.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S5	We selected PharmaNet Canada to conduct this pharmacokinetic study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S6	The clinical portion of this study was completed by the end of 2011, and we expect to finish analyzing the specimens and interpret the data in the first half of 2012.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P64_S7	The study is expected to cost approximately $1 million, which includes the cost of manufacturing TNX-102 and placebo.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	If our pharmacokinetic study is successful, we expect to advance the clinical development of TNX-102 for the management of FM by conducting a larger Phase 2b placebo-controlled study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Utilizing our proprietary formulation, we will seek to replicate and expand upon the efficacy and safety findings of our Moldofsky Study by administering the commercial form of TNX-102 or placebo to approximately 300 FM patients for twelve weeks.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	We expect that our proposed Phase 2b will be one of the two clinical efficacy trials required for FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	We expect the outcome measures for efficacy in this study will be similar to those utilized by drug products currently approved for use in FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Specific efficacy outcome measures will include the Brief Pain Inventory, the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P66_S2	Additional outcome measures for this trial will be carefully planned to further our exploration of treatment effects in important areas such as sleep, fatigue, mood, sexual function and quality of life.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P66_S3	We will seek FDA concurrence on the study design and expect to engage a CRO to conduct this study on our behalf.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P66_S4	We expect the study will enroll a first patient in the third quarter of 2012 and will be completed in the third quarter of 2013.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P66_S5	We anticipate this study will cost approximately $15 million, which includes the cost of manufacturing TNX-102 and placebo.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	Since cyclobenzaprine will be used chronically in TNX-102, we will study TNX-102 in comparison to immediate-release cyclobenzaprine in multiple day dosing (once daily).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	Subjects will ingest TNX-102 or immediate-release cyclobenzaprine for four or more days.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P67_S2	Peak and trough blood levels of cyclobenzaprine will be measured.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P67_S3	The results of this study will provide information regarding blood levels of cyclobenzaprine when taken in a multiple day regimen.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	We plan to conduct a small study designed to compare the bedtime use of TNX-102 and immediate-release cyclobenzaprine on next morning drowsiness.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	The goal of this study is to determine the potential benefit of TNX-102 compared with immediate-release cyclobenzaprine on next morning drowsiness.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	If our Phase 2b study is successful, then we expect to conduct a Phase 3 study in support of product registration.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	At this time, we plan to conduct one large scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in which patients with FM will receive TNX-102 or placebo for six months.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	It is likely that the outcome measures for efficacy in this study will be similar to those used in the Phase 2b study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P69_S3	Other outcome measures will be carefully considered to best support desired label claims and optimal marketing message for product differentiation.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P69_S4	We expect that at least 300 FM patients will be enrolled in this trial.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	To study the safety of our product in chronic use, we expect to conduct an open label study in which approximately 300 FM subjects would receive TNX-102 for up to one year.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	Together with our other studies, we believe this safety exposure study will support the FDA and international regulatory requirements to provide data for at least 300 subjects treated with TNX-102 for six months and at least 100 subjects treated for 1 year.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	The approvals of Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella establish a regulatory approval standard for management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	However, given the heterogeneity of patients with this disease, it may not prove to be the only pathway or approval requirement.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Prior to meeting with the FDA for an End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, we plan to strategically assess the regulatory environment and further evaluate our Phase 2 results in order to determine the optimal design of phase 3 clinical program.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	The phase 3 study design will be discussed with the FDA at the EOP2 meeting to receive regulatory acceptance for a differentiated product for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	We hope to register TNX-102 with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	This regulatory pathway may help to accelerate product development and reduce overall business risk.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	The 505(b)(2)-based product development plan for TNX-102 is designed to leverage the safety data that has been generated by other manufacturers for cyclobenzaprine-containing products and accepted by the FDA in support of their product registration.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	TNX-102 contains significantly less active cyclobenzaprine than other marketed products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	We believe that the safety data package from these products will provide adequate safety margin to support TNX-102 development.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	On August 11, 2011, we had a pre-IND meeting with the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Addiction Products within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA to discuss the IND and NDA requirement of TNX-102 for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	Based on the meeting outcome, we successfully filed an IND application on October 10, 2011, which received FDA clearance on our IND study on November 10, 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P76_S2	The planned IND study is conducted in Canada under a Canadian Clinical Trial Application filed October 7, 2011, which received No Objection Letter on November 7, 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P76_S3	We will continue working with the FDA to seek guidance and agreement on the TNX-102 development program, specifically the necessary data to support the 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory pathway.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P76_S4	As FDA indicated at the pre-IND meeting, the clinical trials in our development plan, if successful, will provide efficacy and safety data sufficient to support an NDA filing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	If NDA approval is granted for TNX-102, in addition to the 3-year marketing exclusivity granted, TNX-102 is expected to be covered under patents that extend through at least 2021, during which time it should not be subject to generic substitution.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	We plan to continue to support the TNX-102 program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and FM patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	TNX-105, our second most advanced product candidate, is another pill formulation of cyclobenzaprine to be taken at bedtime for PTSD, a psychiatric disorder that begins in the aftermath of traumatic experiences.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	We have not yet conducted any clinical trials on PTSD patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	A number of parallels have been noted between FM and PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	In addition, symptom overlaps may exist between patients diagnosed with FM or PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	61(5):663-9.2006), 49% of PTSD patients met the ACR criteria for FM compared to 5% of major depression patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	32(1):38-50), 57% of the sample had symptoms associated with PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Paxil (paroxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline) are FDA approved for PTSD, but are not satisfactory treatments for many patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	Other drugs that show promise for the treatment of PTSD, but are not FDA approved, include antidepressants such as nefazodone, mirtazapine and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; certain atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone; and an adrenergic alpha-1 receptor blocker, prazosin.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P80_S2	Prazosin may decrease nightmares and insomnia and has been associated with improvements in daytime PTSD symptoms, depression, and quality of life.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our rationale for studying the effects of cyclobenzaprine in PTSD derives from the following:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	in studies conducted by Caliper, cyclobenzaprine interacts with a receptor on brain cells called the serotonin type 2a receptor.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	Based on numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications, we have identified a number of compounds that bind this receptor that have been shown to have effects in treating PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	Therefore, it is our belief that cyclobenzaprine, because it binds to the serotonin type 2a receptor, will have a therapeutic effect in treating PTSD like other compounds that bind to it.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	In 2009, we engaged Caliper to learn which receptors in the brain bind cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P83_S1	Caliper measures the interactions of receptors with active pharmaceutical ingredients and has built a proprietary database.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P83_S2	Arthur Weissman, PhD is Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Caliper and supervised the receptor study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P83_S3	Dr. Weissman holds a M.S. degree in Physiology, a Ph.D. degree in Neuroscience, has over 25 years of scientific research and has authored (or co-authored) over 20 peer-reviewed scientific publications.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	The receptor studies were conducted at Caliper s facilities.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	Caliper is constantly conducting receptor studies to expand and refine its database, so the date of each individual receptor-drug analysis is different.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	Caliper provided us proprietary data from their database, which showed cyclobenzaprine binds to the serotonin type 2a receptor.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	We anticipate that the dose for treatment of PTSD symptoms may be higher than that of TNX-102 for FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	We plan to utilize the data obtained from the pharmacokinetic study of TNX-102 to design a Phase 2a study for TNX-105.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P86_S2	We expect that this study will employ the same formulation technology used for FM, but will be dosed with multiple pills to explore a dose range for efficacy and tolerability in PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P86_S3	The estimated treatment period will be six to eight weeks in duration.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	As part of our contemplated Phase 2a study, we plan to assess the appropriateness of a number of clinical outcomes for use as primary and secondary measures.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	The PTSD clinical study measures used for further development work must provide adequate specificity and sensitivity to measure the potential effects of cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	In our Phase 2a study, we anticipate that we will study TNX-105 in less than 50 subjects with combat-related and/or civilian PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	We expect to engage a CRO to conduct this study on our behalf.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	After exploring the clinical utility and dose range in a Phase 2a study, we intend to advance the clinical development of TNX-105 for the treatment of PTSD by conducting a larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Phase 2b.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	The treatment period is estimated to be eight to twelve weeks in duration.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	We will seek to replicate and expand upon the efficacy and safety findings of the Phase 2a study in a larger population of PTSD patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P90_S2	In our Phase 2b study, we anticipate that we will study the drug in 100 to 150 subjects with combat-related and civilian PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P90_S3	We expect to engage a CRO to conduct this study on our behalf.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	If our Phase 2b study is successful, we expect to conduct a Phase 3 program in support of an NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P91_S1	At this time, our general plan includes two large scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, and one open-label extension study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P91_S2	We anticipate that the treatment duration for the two large studies will be approximately 12-16 weeks in length.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P91_S3	The numbers of patients to be evaluated is unknown at this time.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P91_S4	We plan to confer with the FDA concerning the suggested sample sizes in an End-of-Phase 2 program review meeting.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P91_S5	Once completing their participation in one of the two large scale studies, we expect our subjects will have the choice of enrolling in an available open-label study whereby we can assess the longer-term benefits of TNX-105 therapy in PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	The approvals by the FDA of Paxil (paroxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline) for treating PTSD establish a regulatory approval pathway for symptom reduction in PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	We plan to strategically assess the regulatory environment and further evaluate our Phase 2 results to determine the design of Phase 3 clinical studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P92_S2	We believe these studies will result in a differentiated product for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P92_S3	We hope to register TNX-105 with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	We anticipate meeting with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA to discuss TNX-105 at the appropriate time in the future and would review the basis of our Section 505(b)(2) clinical development plan and discuss any other clinical and nonclinical trials necessary to support an NDA filing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	We believe that the clinical trials in our development plan, if successful, will satisfy the requirements for sufficient evidence of clinical efficacy and safety to support an NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	TNX-105 is expected to be covered under patents that have been submitted to the USPTO.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	The USPTO has not yet allowed or granted any claims protecting the use of TNX-105.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	We are investigating different technologies to improve the absorption of cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	For example, we identified and obtained an exclusive worldwide option on technology from Lipocine, Inc. ( Lipocine ) that employs mixtures of different types of lipids.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	Under our agreement, Lipocine studied a number of combinations of lipids for their ability to form micelles that solubilize the free base of cyclobenzaprine and which might serve as inactive ingredients in a gelatin capsule formulation.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P95_S3	We selected a candidate formulation based on properties that included the dispersion of the active ingredient in simulated gastric or small-intestinal fluids and the stability of the formulation over time prior to testing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P95_S4	Lipocine was also engaged to manufacture gelatin capsules of TNX-102 for use in our pharmacokinetic trial.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	In the option agreement, we agreed to make certain sublicense, royalty and milestone payments, which are subject to a request for confidential treatment.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, we have an option to license Lipocine s US patent 6,294,192 Triglyceride-free compositions and methods for improved delivery of hydrophobic therapeutic agents and US Patent 6,451,339 Compositions and methods for improved delivery of hydrophobic agents .
1430306_12_ITEM1_P96_S2	These patents expire on September 24, 2021 and September 16, 2022, respectively.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P96_S3	If we exercise the option to license these patents, we will be obligated to pay Lipocine low single-digit percentage royalties based on net sales or mid-teen sublicense fees based on the consideration that we receive from a licensee.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	Both of our cyclobenzaprine-based product candidates consist of cyclobenzaprine in pills that also contain proprietary ingredients, that are inactive but help the small intestine absorb cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	TNX-102 and TNX-105 are formulations of cyclobenzaprine and mixtures of lipids that are intended as bedtime treatments for FM and PTSD, respectively.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	We have concluded a study of the stability and dissolution of several candidate formulations in simulated gastric and small-intestinal fluids.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S1	The study was conducted in 2007 at Lipocine s facilities.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S2	The first element of the study was to screen lipid ingredients for use in a gelcap.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S3	In this study, various lipid ingredients were mixed with cyclobenzaprine to determine solubility and suitability for formulating cyclobenzaprine in gelatin capsules, or gelcaps.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S4	Based on the results of the screening, four formulations of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride were prepared and analyzed for how efficiently they released or dispersed cyclobenzaprine into solutions of simulated gastric and small-intestinal fluid.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S5	Each of the four formulations resulted in about 95% or more of cyclobenzaprine in solution.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S6	Three of four formulations rapidly (at 30 minutes) released more than 90% of cyclobenzaprine into an acidic solution that simulates gastric conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S7	The second element of the study evaluated physical stability of the formulations.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S8	The four candidate formulations were filled into capsules and subjected to stability conditions at high temperature and temperature cycling.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S9	None of the four formulations showed signs of phase separation or crystallization of cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S10	All four formulations were stable and none showed signs of reduction in cyclobenzaprine potency compared to the initial time.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S11	From these data, we selected two potential formulations for further study based on solubility level and speed of dissolution in acid.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S12	Results from this study showed that certain proprietary lipid mixtures interact with cyclobenzaprine to help solubilize it in simulated gastric and small-intestinal fluids.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P98_S13	Based on the study, we have selected a candidate formulation for cyclobenzaprine to be dosed at bedtime.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	We expect TNX-102 and TNX-105 will employ the same formulation, but TNX-105 will contain a higher dose of cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	We believe one or more of our new formulations will result in the more efficient and more predictable cyclobenzaprine absorption than immediate-release cyclobenzaprine tablets that are commercially available for daytime use to treat muscle spasm.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	Since we expect our formulations will be more efficiently absorbed, we believe lower doses of cyclobenzaprine in our proprietary formulations with lipids will provide a similar therapeutic benefit to higher doses of immediate-release cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	We believe the U.S. market for products that treat CNS conditions has several characteristics that make it an attractive market for pharmaceuticals, including that the customer base is driven by physicians who are involved in long-term care of patients with chronic disorders.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Patients with CNS disorders sometimes carry disease burdens that require long-term treatment.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	We believe the market for FDA-approved FM treatments is underserved and that there is a constant need for new treatment options, since many prescription drugs provide relief only to some of the affected patients or provide relief only for limited periods of time.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	Until 2007, there were no FDA-approved drugs to treat FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	A number of effective medicines have been identified by physicians who observe improvements in a patient s condition as an unintended consequence of prescribing a particular medicine for another purpose.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P104_S1	These anecdotal observations are sometimes substantiated by exposing additional patients in progressively more systematic studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	As information about a potential benefit is reported in scientific literature, or shared among physicians, an increasing number of physicians may prescribe such medicines to their patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P105_S1	This practice, which is not sanctioned by the FDA, is referred to as off-label prescribing or use.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	Off-label prescription practices in the U.S. are acceptable under a long-standing principle that grants physicians the ability to use their professional judgment beyond the FDA recommended uses.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	Before 2007, a variety of drugs, often in combination, were utilized off-label to treat symptoms associated with FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P107_S1	The following three classes of drugs were prescribed as the primary treatments for FM: (1) pain killers, also referred to as analgesics, (2) antidepressants and (3) muscle relaxants.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	In 2007, Lyrica (pregabalin) became the first medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P108_S1	Lyrica previously had been approved and marketed to treat pain in other conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	FM shares a number of symptoms with depression, and a number of FM patients are believed to experience depression as a co-existing condition.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P109_S1	In 2008, Cymbalta (duloxetine) became the second medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P109_S2	Cymbalta previously had been approved and marketed to treat depression.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P109_S3	Savella (milnacipran) was the third medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	Savella s active ingredient, milnacipran, is approved in Europe to treat depression.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	Since Lyrica and Cymbalta also are marketed for other conditions beyond FM, the sales of these products related specifically to FM can only be estimated.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P111_S1	According to Frost Sullivan, the overall gross sales for FM prescription drugs in 2010 was believed to be about $1.2 billion, which has grown since 2007 at a compounded annual growth rate of 18.4%.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P111_S2	This significant increase is a result of more FM patients switching to branded FM prescription drugs that sell for a higher cost than the generic FM prescription drugs previously used.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P111_S3	For example, in 2010, Lyrica prescriptions are estimated to have accounted for 248 million doses for FM and to have generated $478 million in sales, while Cymbalta prescriptions are estimated to have accounted for 93 million doses for FM and to have generated $342 million in sales.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P111_S4	Launched in January 2009, Savella, which is only approved for the treatment of FM, prescriptions accounted for approximately 43 million doses and generated approximately $68 million in sales in 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	Use of the FDA approved medications for FM is growing while the use of off-label treatments is declining.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	Overall, in terms of the number of doses of FM prescription drugs prescribed, Frost Sullivan expects the FM market to grow at only a 1.2% compounded annual growth rate from 2007 to 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	These market dynamics are consistent with the interpretation that Lyrica s growth came at the expense of off-label pain killers and Cymbalta s and Savella s growth came at the expense of off-label anti-depressants.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	According to Frost and Sullivan, FM is an emerging market and sales are anticipated to continue growing in future years.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	Despite the availability of FDA approved products, we believe the current treatment options for FM continue to leave many patients dissatisfied.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	The FM market for muscle relaxants lacks an FDA-approved product and continues to be satisfied by off-label medicines such as cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, baclofen, carisoprodol and metaxalone.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P114_S1	These muscle relaxants have generic and branded versions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P114_S2	According to Frost Sullivan, 48 million doses of the Flexeril brand and its associated immediate-release cyclobenzaprine generic products were prescribed off-label for FM in 2010 and accounted for approximately 35% of the muscle spasm pills prescribed for FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P114_S3	However, the off-label cyclobenzaprine sales for FM in terms of dollars amount to only approximately $10 million, due to the low price of generic cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	Developers of pharmaceutical treatments for syndromes and disorders that affect the CNS face special challenges.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	In many cases, the causes and exacerbating factors of CNS conditions remain unknown.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	Frequently, key symptoms are known only by patient reports and cannot be objectively validated or measured.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P116_S2	Symptoms like pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep or altered mood are characteristics of more than one condition.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P116_S3	Often, physicians may not agree that a particular patient is affected by one or another condition or by more than one co-existing conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	CNS conditions are typically defined by committees of expert professionals who set criteria based on the presence of several symptoms or groups of symptoms.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P117_S1	Sometimes groups of subjective symptoms are insufficient to describe CNS disorders and further refinement of diagnostic categories can be achieved by patient demographics, such as gender, age or concurrent medical processes, such as menopause or adolescence.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	Many CNS conditions, including syndromes and disorders, have not yet been characterized by laboratory tests, such as blood tests or x-ray imaging.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P118_S1	However, laboratory tests are often important to exclude other conditions, such as inflammatory or infectious processes.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P118_S2	Consequently, a CNS condition is sometimes called a diagnosis of exclusion because inflammation and infection should typically be ruled out by laboratory tests before applying the criteria of groups of symptoms to diagnose it.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	Once a CNS condition is diagnosed, physicians may select from among treatment options based on a patient s symptoms and history.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P120_S0	Some medications improve or relieve only one or another symptom in a condition.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P120_S1	Consequently, physicians may prescribe several different medications concurrently to treat individual symptoms or groups of symptoms.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P121_S0	A desirable quality for CNS medications is the ability to relieve more than one symptom of a CNS condition.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P121_S1	Another desirable quality for CNS medications is safety, particularly if a medicine is safe enough to be used with other medicines concurrently or at different times of the day.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P122_S0	We believe the market for the treatment of FM is underserved which we believe fuels a need for new therapeutic options.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P122_S1	Due to the market acceptance of FM treatments (such as Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella), we believe there will be a growing interest in alternative drug treatment options.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P123_S0	We believe that if TNX-102 won FDA approval, it would be an appealing option because it has an entirely different mechanism of action from the currently approved products and we expect TNX-102 will be recommended for use before bedtime.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P124_S0	Lyrica is recommended for twice or three-times daily dosing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P124_S1	Cymbalta was found effective at once-daily dosing and is generally restricted to daytime use and not recommended for bedtime use.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P125_S0	Cymbalta and Savella act on the CNS in ways that are believed to interfere with sleep.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S5	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S6	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P126_S7	Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P127_S0	The markets for medicines to treat FM, PTSD and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P127_S1	Pfizer (Lyrica), Eli Lilly (Cymbalta) and Forest Laboratories/Cyprus Biosciences (Savella) market FDA approved drugs for FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P127_S2	Pfizer (Zoloft) and GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil) market FDA approved drugs for PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P128_S0	As of September 15, 2011 several companies are pursuing treatments for FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P128_S1	Chelsea Therapeutics International, Inc. (CHTP) is developing droxidopa for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P128_S2	Droxidopa is a precursor of the neurotransmitter norephinephrine which suggests it would compete with Cymbalta and Savella which also increase norephinephrine activity.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P129_S0	Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the website, www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P129_S1	A trial of Amrix is recruiting subjects (trial NCT01041495), which may indicate that Cephalon is developing its long-acting formulation of cyclobenzaprine to treat symptoms of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P129_S2	Another trial of Ultracet (tramadol and acetaminophen combination) is listed (trial NCT00766675), which may indicate that Johnson and Johnson is developing Ultracet to treat symptoms of FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P130_S0	A number of companies are specifically engaged in developing drugs for PTSD.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P130_S1	According to ClinicalTrials.gov, ongoing or recent trials of medicines include: quetiapine by AstraZeneca (trial NCT00237393) and by Mclean Hospital (trial NCT01066156), levetiracetam by UCB (trial NCT00413296), 9-THC by Hadassah Medical Organization (trial NCT00965809), paroxetine hydrochloride hydrate by GlaxoSmithKline (trial NCT00557622), topiramate by Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs (trial NCT00203463), hydrocortisone by Lightfighter Trust (trial NCT01090518), mirtazapine by Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene (trial NCT01178671) and by Department of Veterans Affairs (trial NCT00302107), orvepitant by GlaxoSmithKline (trial NCT01000493), d-cycloserine by Weill Medical College of Cornell University (trial NCT00875342), duloxetine by Yale University (trial NCT00763178), ziprasidone by Pfizer (trial NCT00208208),and aripiprazole by Durham VA Medical Center (trial NCT00489866).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P130_S2	Other medications that may be used for the treatment of PTSD include anti-depressants such as: nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine and certain atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P130_S3	Several of these products are supported by companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P131_S0	A potential competing medication for treating FM symptoms at bedtime had been Rekinla which was being developed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, or Jazz.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P131_S1	The active ingredient in Rekinla is sodium oxybate, which results in profound sedation and amnesia.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P131_S2	Sodium oxybate is the active ingredient in XYREM , approved by the FDA for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone, in adult patients with narcolepsy.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P131_S3	Rekinla is administered at bedtime and a second dose is administered by awakening the patient four hours later.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P131_S4	Jazz studies of Rekinla showed that a treatment that affects sleep quality can improve FM symptoms to meet FDA requirements for an effective product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P131_S5	While Jazz obtained compelling evidence supporting the efficacy of its treatment on FM symptoms, the FDA rejected their application to market Rekinla for treating FM in 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P132_S0	Sodium oxybate is a controlled substance under the auspices of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P133_S0	In June 2011, Jazz publicly announced their intention to cease development of Rekinla for FM.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P134_S0	Proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and processes are important to our business and we seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally when we deem appropriate.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P134_S1	We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to protect various aspects of our core technology.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P134_S2	We require our employees, consultants and scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with us.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P135_S0	We own numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P135_S1	In addition, we have one trademark application pending.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P136_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P136_S1	Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P136_S2	We cannot assure you that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P137_S0	Our current patents owned are as follows:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P138_S0	Our current patent applications that are pending are as follows:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P139_S0	We have one trademark application that is pending as follows:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P140_S0	We have one employee dedicated to research and development.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P140_S1	We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase several fold as we move TNX-102 and TNX-105 into clinical development and investigate other product candidates for incorporation into our portfolio.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P140_S2	We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P140_S3	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P140_S4	We expect to use third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P141_S0	We intend to contract with third parties for the manufacture of our compounds for investigational purposes, for preclinical and clinical testing and for any FDA approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P141_S1	We have contracted with Lipocine Inc. to manufacture TNX-102 for use in our ongoing pharmacokinetic study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P141_S2	We will need to contract with a larger scale cGMP contract manufacturer for product to be used in further studies of TNX-102, which we do not anticipate any problems in securing as needed.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P142_S0	All of our compounds are small molecules, generally constructed using industry standard processes and use readily accessible raw materials.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P143_S1	These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P143_S2	The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P143_S3	Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P144_S0	The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FFDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P144_S1	The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P145_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P146_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P147_S0	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P147_S1	The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P147_S2	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P148_S0	The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator s brochure.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P148_S1	An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P148_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P148_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P149_S0	An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P149_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P149_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P150_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P150_S1	Each protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P151_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P152_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P153_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P154_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P155_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P155_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease, but sometimes can include several thousand patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P155_S2	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P156_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P156_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P156_S2	Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P156_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P157_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P158_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P158_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P158_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P159_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P160_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the full NDA and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P161_S0	NDAs that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P161_S1	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FFDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P161_S2	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P161_S3	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P161_S4	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P162_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P162_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P163_S0	Because we are developing new formulations of previously approved chemical entities, such as cyclobenzaprine, our drug approval strategy is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P163_S1	The FDA may not agree that our product candidates are approvable as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P163_S2	If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for our product candidates, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could substantially and materially increase, and our products might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P163_S3	If the FDA requires full NDAs for our product candidates, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P164_S0	Based on our intent to file under Section 505(b)(2) with respect to our two lead product candidates, we believe it is unlikely the development process for these product candidates will follow the ordinary course of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P164_S1	Our planned human pharmacokinetics study of reformulated cyclobenzaprine pills will represent the first use of TNX-102 in humans and could therefore be described as Phase 1.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P164_S2	However, because the study will compare TNX-102 to existing approved formulations of cyclobenzaprine and will specify the comparable ability to deliver effective levels of cyclobenzaprine to the bloodstream of FM patients, this study will also provide a reference to the therapeutic effects previously observed in our dose-ranging clinical study of immediate-release cyclobenzaprine tablets in FM patients.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P164_S3	For these reasons, rather than always identifying clinical trials by Phase, we find it more illustrative to describe in a narrative form the purpose of the studies and the nature and potential significance of the results.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P164_S4	Because our double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study on bedtime cyclobenzaprine was performed in Canada, we have not had meetings with the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to discuss our approach and plans.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P165_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P165_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed by the FDA for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P165_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P165_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P166_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P167_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P167_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P168_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_12_ITEM1_P168_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P169_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P169_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P169_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P170_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P171_S0	The FFDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P171_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P171_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 1/2 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P171_S3	The FFDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P171_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P172_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P173_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P173_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P173_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P173_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P173_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P174_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P174_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P175_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P175_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P175_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P175_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P175_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_12_ITEM1_P176_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P177_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P177_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P178_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P179_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P179_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P179_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P180_S0	In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, became law.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P180_S1	This legislation grants significant new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P180_S2	In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information, and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P180_S3	In addition, the new law significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P180_S4	Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P181_S0	The FDA has not yet implemented many of the provisions of the FDAAA, so we cannot predict the impact of the new legislation on the pharmaceutical industry or our business.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P181_S1	However, the requirements and changes imposed by the FDAAA may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P181_S2	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P181_S3	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P182_S0	As of March 1, 2012, we had one full time employee, who is Benjamin Selzer.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P182_S1	We intend to hire two additional full-time employees in the near future a Chief Financial Officer and a senior director of drug development/ controller as well as a part-time senior director of research.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P183_S0	In addition, we rely on consultants instead of employees for critical activities, including Seth Lederman who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and as President of Tonix Sub pursuant to a consulting agreement with Lederman Co., and Seth Lederman and Donald Landry who provide scientific consulting pursuant to a consulting agreement with L L Technologies, LLC.
1430306_12_ITEM1_P184_S0	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company and its prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of products that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, development and laboratory testing and clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We cannot assure you that we will ever have a product approved by the FDA, that we will bring any product to market or, if we are successful in doing so, that we will ever become profitable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities increase.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm with an explanatory paragraph for the year ended December 31, 2011 with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The existence of such a report may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	There is no assurance that we will not receive a similar report for our year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In their report dated March 30, 2012, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we have incurred losses since inception of development stage, have a negative cash flow from operations and have working capital and stockholders deficiencies and require additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have no approved products on the market and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, TNX-102, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We currently have one lead product candidate, TNX-102 for the treatment of FM, and the success of our business currently depends on its successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of TNX-102.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	TNX-102 has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for this product candidate anywhere in the world.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The clinical development program for TNX-102 may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approval for TNX-102 in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and clinical trials and marketing activities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next nine months.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We anticipate that we will need an additional $1 million to continue our operations for the next 12 months.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We may, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to initiate clinical trials or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our lead product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors' products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents on products we develop.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the PTO ) and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success depends on our patents, patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine the priority of inventions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, PTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Also, a third party may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	An adverse decision in litigation could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Interference proceedings brought before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to our patents or patent applications.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	During an interference proceeding, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Even if successful, an interference proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If preclinical testing or clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including clinical research organizations and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical testing or clinical trials involving our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical testing or clinical trials than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical testing or clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical trials, consistent with a clinical trial protocol.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Delays in preclinical and clinical testing could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Once a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If clinical trials are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If we are unable to file for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore possibly obtain a shortened review period for the applications.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	While we met with the FDA in August 2011 to discuss initial plans for the future development of TNX-102, we have not yet come to full agreement with the FDA as to the nature or extent of any studies we may be required to conduct in order to achieve approval for any of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P53_S2	The timeline for filing and review of our NDAs is based on our plan to submit those NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, wherein we will rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our lead product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S7	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications, and the FDA may not agree that our products qualify for marketing approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Sub since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Loss of the services of Dr. Lederman would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We have key-man insurance on the life of Dr. Lederman.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	We are also highly dependent on the other principal members of our management and scientific team.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	However, we have no employment agreement with Dr. Lederman and while we have employment agreements with certain of our employees, all of our employees may terminate their employment at any time.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P58_S4	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Moreover, our work force is located in the Pharmaceutical Corridor that spans New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in clinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our trials, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We intend to rely on third parties to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical trials and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates requires manufacturing of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P63_S3	We are currently in discussions with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P63_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P63_S5	We may not be successful in identifying such additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any that we do identify.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with any of these manufacturers.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P64_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for cGMP compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P68_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the DEA and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P71_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and our business.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development .
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain .
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain .
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct adequate and well controlled clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P80_S3	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P80_S5	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, commonly known as cGMP, for use in clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials; the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically significant safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our clinical trials may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our product is expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our products in clinical development.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P83_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operation.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to a New Drug Application, or NDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P85_S3	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P86_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P86_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P86_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Following completion of clinical trials, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P90_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs - six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P90_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P90_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some case and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA is approved.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	None of our product candidates has been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P101_S3	If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our strategy with our lead product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S4	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S5	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P104_S6	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P105_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P108_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P108_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P108_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P109_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P109_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P109_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P109_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P109_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P110_S0	In the event that we are successful in bringing any products to market, our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products successfully may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P112_S0	other third party payors, including Medicare.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for newly-approved health care products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P113_S2	Government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P114_S0	The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P114_S1	If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any prescription product we bring to market, doctors may not prescribe them or patients may ask to have their physicians prescribe competing drugs with more favorable reimbursement.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P115_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P115_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P115_S2	In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P115_S3	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P115_S4	Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators' drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S3	We currently do not carry clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S4	We intend to obtain such insurance in the future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S5	We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S6	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S7	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S8	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators' products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P117_S9	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P119_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P120_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P120_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P121_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P121_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P121_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P122_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P122_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P123_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P124_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P125_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P126_S0	There has been a limited trading market for our Common Stock and no market activity to date.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Currently, our Common Stock is available for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P127_S1	However, prior to February 2012, there was no trading activity in our Common Stock and only a few trades have occurred to date.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P127_S2	It is anticipated that there will be a limited trading market for the Common Stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P127_S3	The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P127_S4	The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P127_S5	An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using Common Stock as consideration.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P128_S0	You may have difficulty trading and obtaining quotations for our Common Stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Our Common Stock may not be actively traded, and the bid and asked prices for our Common Stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board may fluctuate widely.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P129_S1	As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our securities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P129_S2	This severely limits the liquidity of the Common Stock, and would likely reduce the market price of our Common Stock and hamper our ability to raise additional capital.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P130_S0	The market price for our Common Stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P131_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P131_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P132_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P133_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P134_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Investor relations activities, nominal float and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S0	The Company expects to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for the Company.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S1	These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S2	The Company may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third-parties based upon publicly-available information concerning the Company.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S3	The Company will not be responsible for the content of analyst reports and other writings and communications by investor relations firms not authored by the Company or from publicly available information.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S4	The Company does not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts reports or other materials based upon analysts own research or methods.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S5	Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S6	In addition, investors in the Company may be willing, from time to time, to encourage investor awareness through similar activities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P136_S7	Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market our common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The SEC and FINRA enforce various statutes and regulations intended to prevent manipulative or deceptive devices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security and carefully scrutinize trading patterns and company news and other communications for false or misleading information, particularly in cases where the hallmarks of pump and dump activities may exist, such as rapid share price increases or decreases.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P137_S1	We, and our shareholders may be subjected to enhanced regulatory scrutiny due to the small number of holders who initially will own the registered shares of our common stock publicly available for resale, and the limited trading markets in which such shares may be offered or sold which have often been associated with improper activities concerning penny-stocks, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the OTCQB Marketplace (Pink OTC) or pink sheets.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P137_S2	Until such time as our restricted shares are registered or available for resale under Rule 144, there will continue to be a small percentage of shares held by a small number of investors, many of whom acquired such shares in privately negotiated purchase and sale transactions, that will constitute the entire available trading market.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P138_S0	The Supreme Court has stated that manipulative action is a term of art connoting intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Often times, manipulation is associated by regulators with forces that upset the supply and demand factors that would normally determine trading prices.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Since a small percentage of the outstanding common stock of the Company will initially be available for trading, held by a small number of individuals or entities, the supply of our common stock for sale will be extremely limited for an indeterminate amount of time, which could result in higher bids, asks or sales prices than would otherwise exist.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Securities regulators have often cited thinly-traded markets, small numbers of holders, and awareness campaigns as components of their claims of price manipulation and other violations of law when combined with manipulative trading, such as wash sales, matched orders or other manipulative trading timed to coincide with false or touting press releases.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P141_S1	There can be no assurance that the Company s or third-parties activities, or the small number of potential sellers or small percentage of stock in the float, or determinations by purchasers or holders as to when or under what circumstances or at what prices they may be willing to buy or sell stock will not artificially impact (or would be claimed by regulators to have affected) the normal supply and demand factors that determine the price of the stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P143_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P143_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P143_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P143_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P144_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P145_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P145_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P146_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P147_S0	If we or our existing shareholders sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, our stock price may decline.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P148_S0	If we or our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that we or our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock, particularly with respect to our affiliates, directors, executive officers or other insiders, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P149_S0	In the future, we may issue additional shares to our employees, directors or consultants, in connection with corporate alliances or acquisitions, or to raise capital.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P149_S1	Due to these factors, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Our officers, directors and principal shareholders own a controlling interest in our voting stock and Investors will not have any voice in our management.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Our officers, directors and principal shareholders, in the aggregate, beneficially own or control the votes of approximately 61.26% of our outstanding Common Stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P151_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P152_S0	adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P153_S0	As a result of their ownership and positions, our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders collectively are able to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P153_S1	In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors, executive officers or principal shareholders, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P153_S2	Management s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Our common stock is not currently traded at high volume, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell or liquidate a substantial number of shares at one time.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Our common stock is currently traded, but with very low, if any, volume, based on quotations on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board , meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P155_S1	This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is still relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P155_S2	As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P156_S0	We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will be sustained.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P157_S0	Shareholders should be aware that, according to Commission Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P157_S1	Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P158_S1	Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P158_S2	The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the future volatility of our share price.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Efforts to comply with recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and require additional management resources, and we still may fail to comply.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P160_S0	As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, in the event we are no longer a smaller reporting company, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements would be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P160_S1	Such attestation requirement by our independent registered public accounting firm would not be applicable to us until the report for the year ended December 31, 2012 at the earliest, if at all.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P160_S2	If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is required to, but is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P161_S0	Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P162_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P162_S1	For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P163_S0	the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P164_S0	In order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P165_S0	make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P166_S0	The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P167_S0	that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P168_S1	This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P169_S0	Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P169_S1	Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P170_S0	FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P171_S0	In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P171_S1	Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P171_S2	Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.
1430306_12_ITEM1A_P171_S3	The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.
1430306_12_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our current office space consists of approximately 2,355 square feet.
1430306_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease expires in September 2015.
1430306_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	The base rent is as follows:

1430306_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

1430306_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	On October 7, 2011, we issued 22,666,667 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Tonix Sub in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	The shares were issued to accredited investors pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D or non-U.S. Persons pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	On October 7, 2011, we issued 400,000 shares of our common stock to a placement agent in connection with an amendment to a placement agent agreement.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The shares were issued to an accredited investor pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	Between October and November 2011, we sold to certain investors (the Purchasers ) for aggregate cash proceeds of $1,575,000, secured convertible debentures (the Debentures ) in the principal face amount of $1,575,000 and the exchange of $500,000 in previously issued notes of Tonix Sub that were converted into Debentures in the principal face amount of $500,000 (the Financing ).
1430306_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Debentures were sold to accredited investors pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D or non-U.S. Persons pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	The Debentures mature on the earlier of (i) one year from the date of issuance or (ii) the date of closing of a private placement of equity, equity equivalent, convertible debt or debt financing in which we receive gross proceeds, in one or more transactions, of at least $3,425,000 (a Subsequent Financing ).
1430306_12_ITEM5_P6_S1	The Debentures bear interest at 8% per annum and are convertible at the holder s option into a Subsequent Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM5_P6_S2	In the event that a Subsequent Financing has not occurred within 12 months from the date of issuance of the Debenture, the holder has the option to convert the Debenture into a number of shares of our common stock equal to 1% of our shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis for every $125,000 of Debentures (the Conversion Shares ).
1430306_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	In addition, upon conversion or repayment of the Debenture, the holder is entitled to receive, at the holder s option, either (i) a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase such number of shares of common stock equal to the principal amount of the Debenture divided by the offering price in a Subsequent Financing (the Warrant Shares ) or (ii) shares of our common stock equal to 33% of the principal amount of the Debenture divided by the offering price in a Subsequent Financing (the Incentive Shares ).
1430306_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	In connection with the Financing, placement agents earned warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock equal to 3 or 9% of the gross proceeds delivered by Purchasers introduced by such placement agents in the Financing divided by the purchase price per share in the Subsequent Financing (collectively, the Prior Agent Warrants ).
1430306_12_ITEM5_P8_S1	In the event that the Subsequent Financing has not occurred within 12 months from the date of issuance of the Debentures, the placement agents will receive, in lieu of the Prior Agent Warrants, shares of common stock equal to 3 or 9% of the number of shares of Common Stock such Purchasers introduced by such placement agent in the Financing are entitled to receive upon conversion of their Debentures.
1430306_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may will, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and continue, or similar words.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Important factors currently known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company s services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on developing new pharmaceuticals products that are safer and more effective than widely prescribed CNS drugs in large and growing markets.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The ongoing advances in science and medicine provide a number of opportunities to apply known active pharmaceutical ingredients to new uses.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We use the unfolding understanding of disease and medicine when we search for potential therapeutic solutions among prescription pharmaceutical agents that have been used safely in patients for other conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	We seek to create new dose and formulation options and that are tailored to the new therapeutic uses for these agents.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Many CNS drugs have been identified by physicians who prescribe drugs for some purpose, but observe unexpected improvements in their patients CNS conditions.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	One of our goals is to establish formal clinical study programs to determine if such anecdotal observations are, in fact, reflections of the compound s ability to treat the CNS condition.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	While some new applications can use the commercially available form of the drug, in other cases reformulating the active ingredient may improve the active ingredient s safety or effectiveness in treating the condition.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	If the formal development programs are proven successful in the clinical tests, we will seek marketing approval from the FDA.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are currently devoting our efforts to the development of two lead product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our two most advanced programs are new dose formulations of cyclobenzaprine, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two widely prescribed muscle relaxant products.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Due to the well-characterized history of the main active ingredient, we believe our lead products, referred to herein as TNX-102 and TNX-105, have the potential to progress through a shorter development pathway than is typical for drug products based on novel active ingredients.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	We expect TNX-102 could be approved by FDA after two efficacy studies and a safety exposure study that together would expose the minimum number of FM patients that satisfy FDA s standards, whereas drug products based on novel active ingredients need exposure to significantly more study subjects.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	For commercial reasons, we do not disclose the identities of the active ingredients or targeted indications in our pipeline until a U.S. patent has been allowed or issued.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	Consistent with our mission, these product candidates are or likely will be reformulations of active ingredients that have been used in humans in other products and which are designed for new CNS therapeutic indications.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	In other cases, the products will be formulated to match earlier ( predicate ) products closely enough to be considered generic copies or similar enough to other medications to rely (in part) on their regulatory review and approval.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The predicate product may be approved by the FDA under an NDA or may have been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the National Academy of Sciences under the DESI, in which case they would be considered by FDA to be unapproved products .
1430306_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	For DESI products, it is our intent to develop NDA versions by modernizing the chemistry, manufacturing and controls and to perform new clinical studies to support an NDA filing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	In August 2010, we formed Krele to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate NDA products.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We anticipate that when our branded products lose patent protection, Krele may market authorized generic versions of them.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Krele also may develop or acquire generic products approved under ANDAs and we may market branded versions (branded generics) of such products.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	On October 7, 2011, we executed and consummated the Share Exchange Agreement with Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Pursuant to the Share Exchange, each share of Tonix Sub s common stock was exchanged for 0.9 shares of our common stock, and each share of Tonix Sub s Series A and B preferred stock was exchanged for 4.8 shares of our common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Sub shareholders, including holders of 1,396,982 restricted shares, which were subject to accelerated vesting, received in exchange for all of their shares, an aggregate of 22,666,667 shares of our common stock and our existing stockholders retained 4,000,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	The 22,666,667 shares issued to the Tonix Sub shareholders constituted approximately 85% of our 26,666,667 shares of common stock issued and outstanding after the Share Exchange.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	For accounting purposes, the acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of Tonix Sub, accompanied by the issuance of our common stock for the outstanding common stock of Toxic Sub which was recorded at a nominal value.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	The historical financial statements are those of Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	The accompanying financial statements give retroactive effect to the recapitalization as if it had occurred on June 7, 2007 (inception date).
1430306_12_ITEM7_P10_S8	Also, professional services expenses were allocated to research and development and general and administrative expenses in the 2010 and cumulative from inception through December 31, 2011 statement of operations to be consistent with the current period s presentation.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing our lead products, TNX-102 and TNX-105.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing studies and the cost of drug ingredients used in such studies, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy of our drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We plan to start the next phase of clinical trials for our product candidates TNX-102 and TNX-105 over the next 12 months, subject to raising necessary funds.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Clinical trials can be very expensive.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	If these and additional necessary clinical trials are successful, we plan to prepare and submit applications to the FDA for marketing approval for our drug candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	As a result of these and other factors, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next 12 to 24 months.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We expect that a larger percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P14_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected patient recruitment, or government delays.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold .
1430306_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	We had no revenues or cost of goods sold during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 were $1,158,167, an increase of $573,869, or 98.2%, from $584,298 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	In 2011, we incurred $342,398 and $318,616 in clinical cost and activities, respectively, as compared to $0 in 2010 for both.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 were $2,220,361, an increase of $875,971, or 65%, from $1,344,390 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	This increase is primarily due to payroll related expenses and professional services.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Payroll related expenses increased to $731,284 in the current year from $413,954 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $317,330, or 77%.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Payroll related expenses include both cash and non-cash compensation associated with the vesting of restricted stock grants.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increase in payroll related costs was a result of a full year of payments to our members of the core management team who joined in June through August of 2010, along with the acceleration of vesting in conjunction with our reverse merger in 2011 of restricted stock previously issued to our employees.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Professional services for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $1,121,547, an increase of $440,642, or 65%, over the $680,905 recognized for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Of professional services, legal fees totaled $373,075 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $15,657, or 4.4%, from $357,418 incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.

1430306_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	The increase was primarily a result of $189,691 in regulatory costs in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $0 in 2010, offset by a reduction in public relations expenses of $45,513.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	Accounting fees incurred in fiscal 2011 amounted to $243,003, an increase of $145,400, or 149%, from $97,603 incurred in fiscal 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	The increase included costs associated with the audit of Tonix Sub s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, review of our interim financial statements and filings with the SEC related to our recent reverse merger, completed in October 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs for fiscal 2011 were $69,268, an increase of $34,548, or 100%, from $34,720 incurred in fiscal 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to medical and life sciences conferences.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	Rent for fiscal 2011 totaled $128,228, an increase of $85,657, or 201%, from $42,571 incurred in fiscal 2010, due primarily to the opening of new office space in New York.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Depreciation expense in fiscal 2011 totaled $9,300, an increase of $5,446, or 141%, over the expense of $3,854 incurred in fiscal 2010, as a result of the purchase of new office computers.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Interest expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $91,585, an increase of $55,803, or 156%, from $35,782 incurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	In 2011, our interest costs were comprised primarily of amortization of deferred financing costs in conjunction with the issuance of our secured convertible debentures in October 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	We incurred an aggregate of $249,543 in deferred financing costs, of which we amortized $53,377 as interest expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	In addition, we incurred interest expense related to $500,000 of notes payable and our secured convertible debentures.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	As a result of the foregoing, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $3,470,113, compared to a net loss of $1,964,470 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had a working capital deficit of $781,723.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, we used $2,637,538 of cash in operating activities.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	Cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,613,000 from the sale of shares of capital stock of $612,000, issuance of notes payable of $500,000 and net proceeds of $1,501,000 from issuance of secured convertible debentures.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	In the comparable 2010 period, $1,342,000 was raised through the sale of shares of capital stock and $50,000 through the issuance of demand notes, which were converted into shares of capital stock in July 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	At December 31, 2011, we had cash of $41,123 compared to $65,359 at December 31, 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	Our cash is held in bank deposit accounts.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	At December 31, 2011, we had $2,075,000 of secured convertible debentures outstanding.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Cash used in operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $2,637,538, and $1,233,341, respectively, which represent cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such years.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Increase in cash outlays principally resulted from clinical cost and activities, regulatory cost, payroll and rent.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cash generated by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $302, compared to a usage of $94,366 in 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	In 2011, we received a return of a security deposit from space vacated in New Jersey and in 2010 we placed $60,000 in a restricted cash account as collateral for the lease on the New York office.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	In 2011 and 2010, we purchased office furniture and computer equipment of $2,764 and $34,279, respectively.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	In their report dated March 30, 2012, our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	In addition, we have both working capital and stockholders' deficiencies at December 31, 2011 and require additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	Further, we do not have any commercial products available for sale and have not generated revenues and there is no assurance that if approval of our products is received that we will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	In addition, there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, obtaining loans from various financial institutions or being awarded grants from government agencies, where possible.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	We expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to additional clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	We believe our existing cash, together with the net proceeds of the 2012 Financing, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for the next six months.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We presently do not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Due to our history and historical operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	We will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P31_S5	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	On September 9, 2011, Tonix Sub sold $500,000 principal amount of convertible notes (the Notes ) to nine accredited investors.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The Notes were due one year from the date of issuance, bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum and were automatically converted into Debentures in the Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Between October and November, 2011 we consummated the Financing pursuant to which we sold $2,075,000 principal amount of Debentures for aggregate cash proceeds of $1,575,000 and the exchange of $500,000 in previously issued Notes of Tonix Sub that were converted into Debentures in the principal face amount of $500,000.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Debentures mature on the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the date of issuance or (ii) the date of closing of a Subsequent Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The Debentures bear interest at 8% per annum and are convertible at the holder s option into a Subsequent Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	In the event that a Subsequent Financing has not occurred within 12 months from the date of issuance of the Debenture, the holder has the option to convert the Debenture into the Conversion Shares.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	In addition, upon conversion or repayment of the Debenture, the holders were entitled to receive, at the holder s option, either (i) the Conversion Warrant or (ii) the Incentive Shares.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	The private placement that closed in January 2012 met the requirements of a Subsequent Financing, therefore, the holders of the Debentures elected to receive 275,000 Conversion Warrants and 594,000 Incentive Shares.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P35_S5	The Conversion Warrants have three year term and $1.00 exercise price.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	In connection with the Financing, we made cash payments to WFG Investments and Seagate of $40,000 and $14,000, respectively, as commissions and attorney fees of $20,000.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	In addition, WFG Investments and Seagate earned an aggregate of 30,750 Prior Agent Warrants, which have terms similar to the Conversion Warrants.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Between January and March, 2012, we consummated a private placement financing transaction (the 2012 Financing ) pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 264.7106 units ( Units ) to certain investors for aggregate cash proceeds of $4,692,765 and the exchange of $1,925,000 in previously issued Debentures that were converted into Units.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The 2012 Financing satisfied the requirements for the Subsequent Financing discussed above.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Each Unit had a purchase price of $25,000 per Unit and consisted of twenty five thousand (25,000) shares of our Common Stock, a Class A Warrant to purchase twenty five thousand (25,000) shares of common stock (the Class A Warrants ), and a Class B Warrant to purchase up to twenty five thousand (25,000) shares of common stock (the Class B Warrants and together with the Class A Warrants, the Warrants ).
1430306_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Class A Warrants have an exercise price of $1.25 per share of Common Stock and will be exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Class B Warrants may not be exercised by the Purchasers and will be exercised automatically on their expiration date by cashless exercise or expire without exercise.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	In the event that the average of our daily volume weighted average price is below $0.75 during the 10 trading days after the Announcement Date (as hereinafter defined) (the Measuring Period ), then the holder will be entitled to receive additional shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of the Class B Warrants on the expiration date, which is the 12 th trading day after the Announcement Date.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	In the event that our average daily volume weighted average price is at or above $0.75 during the Measuring Period, the Class B Warrants will expire unexercised.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	The Announcement Date is the earlier of (1) the date on which we announce via press release the results of the pharmacokinetic study of our TNX-102 drug formulation; or (2) June 1, 2012.

1430306_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	the number of shares of common stock purchased by the Class B Warrant holder.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	However, for purposes of this calculation, in no event shall the average of our daily volume weighted average price be less than $0.50.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	For example, in the event that an investor purchases one Unit and the average of our daily volume weighted average price is $0.50, then the Class B Warrant will be exercised and the holder will receive 24,500 shares of Common Stock.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In connection with the Financing, we paid Dawson James Securities, Inc., a FINRA registered broker-dealer ( Dawson James ) a cash payment of $466,777, which represented an 8% commission and a 2% non-accountable expense allowance of the gross proceeds delivered by investors in the 2012 Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	In addition, Dawson James earned warrants to purchase 466,777 shares of Common Stock, which have an exercise price of $1.25 per share of common stock, will be exercisable for a period of seven years, contain customary anti-dilution protection and are entitled to piggy-back registration rights.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	In August 2011, we authorized the initiation of formulation work and manufacturing of TNX-102 for clinical trials pursuant to a contract with Lipocine with respect to a research and development project for reformulation work on our leading products for a fee of $235,000, with work started in the third quarter of 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	In July 2011, we entered into a contract with a contract research organization in July 2011 to investigate the feasibility of developing a new, proprietary formulation of cyclobenzaprine at a cost of $58,080.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	In September 2011, we entered into a contract with Pharmanet Canada for contract research work with respect to the pharmacokinetic study for TNX-102.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	The full cost of the work to be performed is $637,231.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	Payment is due in four installments based on the achievement of certain performance milestones.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S5	In October 2011, we entered into an agreement with another contract research organization to develop, and perform an exploratory pharmacokinetic study on, a new formulation of cyclobenzaprine for an approximate cost of $180,000.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P44_S6	In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with a public relations firm to provide news media placement and political intelligence from January 2012 through June 2012 for a total cost of $60,000.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Dr. Seth Lederman, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and Dr. Donald Landry, one of our directors, are the primary founders of Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We have entered into various transactions with several companies under their control, including L L Technologies, Plumbline, Targent Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Lederman Co.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	In 2010, we entered into two-year consulting agreements with L L Technologies for scientific and medical consulting services, and Lederman Co. for clinical development, strategic, management and operational consulting services.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	In consideration for its services, L L Technologies receives $96,000 per annum.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	The consulting agreement renews automatically for subsequent terms of one year at $96,000 per annum.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	Lederman Co. received $250,000 per annum for its services, until August 1, 2011, when it received $127,000 per annum until such time as we closed on the 2012 Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S6	We first closed on the 2012 Financing in January 2012, and effective February 1, 2012, Lederman Co. receives $250,000 per annum for its services.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S7	The consulting agreement renews automatically for subsequent terms of one year at $250,000 per annum.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S8	Additionally, on September 9, 2011, L L Technologies, Targent Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Lederman Co. purchased $265,000 principal amount of convertible Notes.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P45_S9	Such notes were converted into Debentures on October 7, 2011 and in January 2012 such Debentures were converted into the 2012 Financing.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	In 2010, Tonix Sub s board of directors and stockholders approved the terms and provisions of the 2010 Stock Plan ( 2010 Plan ) whereby it reserved 4,564,641 shares of its common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2010 Plan.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The 2010 Plan allowed for grants of options to purchase shares of common stock and awards of restricted common stock to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of Tonix Sub.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Tonix Sub has granted under the 2010 Plan 2,898,689 shares of restricted stock, 349,082 of which were forfeited and the remaining 2,549,607 shares vested prior to or on October 7, 2011, the date of Share Exchange after which the 2010 Plan ceased to exist.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	Our stock based compensation expenses amounted to $ 435,651 in 2011 and $139,882 in 2010.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	In February 2012, we approved the 2012 Incentive Stock Options Plan ( 2012 Plan ).
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	The 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock to officers, directors, employees and consultants.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	Under the terms of the 2012 Plan, we may issue Incentive Stock Options, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and nonstatutory options.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S3	The Board of Directors determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the options granted under the 2012 Plan.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S4	However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option must not at least 100% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant (or 110% for any stockholder that owns 10% or more of our common stock).
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S5	The fair market value of the common stock determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in a good faith.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S6	Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the 2012 Plan should not be more than five years and expiration period not more than ten years.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P47_S7	We reserved 4,000,000 shares of our common stock for future issuance under the terms of the 2012 Plan.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	In September 2010, we entered into a five-year lease for office space in New York City, with monthly payments escalating from approximately $10,000 in first year to approximately $11,000 in fifth year.

1430306_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	We issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $60,000 for the benefit of the landlord which is collateralized by a money market account.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	Our future minimum lease payments under the operating lease are as follows:
1430306_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P49_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Tonix outsources its research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Because shares of our common stock have not been publicly traded prior to October 7, 2011, we have valued our stock by considering events that have occurred since the date of grants, transactions involving the sale of our common stock to independent third parties and the results of a third party valuation of the projected discounted cash flows of the Company.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1430306_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (a development stage company) (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years than ended and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2011 and the consolidated statements of stockholders deficiency for each of the four years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2007.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2011 and consolidated changes in stockholders deficiency for each of the four years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and for the period June 7, 2007 through December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations, has both working capital and stockholders' deficiencies at December 31, 2011 and requires additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P4_S2	These events and conditions, among others referred to in Note 2, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P4_S3	Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P4_S4	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. through its wholly owned subsidiary Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is attempting to develop safer and more effective versions of widely prescribed central nervous system ( CNS ) drugs.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	While some new applications can use the commercially available form of the drug, in other cases reformulating the active ingredient improves its safety or effectiveness in treating the CNS condition.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	When formal development programs have proven successful in clinical tests, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. intends to seek marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ).
1430306_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	On August 16, 2010, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. formed Krele LLC ( Krele ) in the state of Delaware.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	Krele is a limited liability corporation whose sole member is Tonix Pharmaceuticals Inc.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	Krele was established to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate new drug application products or versions of drug efficacy study implementation products.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P6_S3	The Company expects that its relationship to Krele will be similar to that of several other pharmaceutical companies and their subsidiaries that market generic versions of the parent's branded products at different periods in their product life-cycle.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	On October 7, 2011, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Krele Pharmaceuticals, Inc. incorporated on June 7, 2007 in the State of Delaware) and a publicly traded non-operating shell company Tamandare Explorations Inc. ( Tamandare ), incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, along with certain other parties executed and consummated a share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange ).
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	Pursuant to the Share Exchange, each share of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Inc. s common stock was exchanged for 0.9 shares of Tamandare s common stock and each share of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s Series A and B preferred stock was exchanged for 4.8 shares of Tamandare s common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S2	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. shareholders, including holders of restricted shares, which were subject to accelerated vesting, received in exchange for all of their shares, an aggregate of 22,666,667 shares of Tamandare s common stock and Tamandare s existing stockholders retained 4,000,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S3	The 22,666,667 shares issued to the Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. shareholders constituted approximately 85% of Tamandare s 26,666,667 issued and outstanding shares of common stock after the Share Exchange.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S4	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became Tamandare s wholly-owned subsidiary and in October 2011 Tamandare was renamed Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S5	As the owners and management of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. obtained voting and operating control of Tamandare after the Share Exchange and Tamandare was non-operating, had no assets or liabilities and did not meet the definition of a business, the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., accompanied by the issuance of its common stock for outstanding common stock of Tamandare, which was recorded at a nominal value.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P7_S6	The accompanying financial statements and related notes give retroactive effect to the recapitalization as if it had occurred on June 7, 2007 (inception date) and accordingly all share and per share amounts have been adjusted.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Krele LLC (hereafter referred to as the Company or Tonix ).
1430306_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	As the Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business, and while planned principal operations have commenced, there has been no revenue generated from sales, license fees or royalties, the Company is considered a development stage enterprise.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	Accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance related to a development stage enterprise.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P9_S2	Financial position, results of operations and cash flows of a development stage enterprise are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that apply to established operating enterprises.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	In addition, the Company has both working capital and stockholders' deficiencies at December 31, 2011 and requires additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	Although, in the first quarter of 2012, the Company raised approximately $4,700,000 (see Note 11), it s expected that cash used in operations will increase significantly over the next several years.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S5	There can be no assurance that such funds, if available at all, can be obtained on terms reasonable to the Company.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S6	If the Company is unsuccessful in raising additional capital it will need to reduce costs and operations substantially.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S7	Further, the Company does not have any commercial products available for sale and has not generated revenues and there is no assurance that if approval of their products is received that the Company will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P10_S8	In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The above factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	Significant estimates include the useful life of fixed assets and assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying 2010 financial statements together with cumulative amounts from inception have been reclassified to allocate professional services expenses to research and development and general and administrative expenses to be consistent with current year presentation.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life, which is three years for computer assets and five years for furniture and all other equipment.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits.

1430306_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P18_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non forfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss, by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock, adjusted to give effect to the exchange ratio in the Share Exchange in October 2011 (see Note 1), which was accounted for as recapitalization of the Company.

1430306_12_ITEM9_P0_S1	The reports of MaloneBailey on our financial statements for each of the past two fiscal years contained no adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except as that the reports of MaloneBailey for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 indicated conditions which raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_12_ITEM9_P0_S2	The decision to change independent accountants was approved by our Board of Directors on October 7, 2011.
1430306_12_ITEM9_P1_S0	During our two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this report, we have had no disagreements with MaloneBailey on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of MaloneBailey, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in its report on our financial statements for such periods.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of December 31, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The material weaknesses, which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are:
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	We did not have sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	As a result we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were not able to provide for adequate reviewing of the financial statements.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	b) We did not maintain sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge, experience, and training in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our complexity and our financial accounting and reporting requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	This control deficiency is pervasive in nature.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Further, there is a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements including disclosures will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We are committed to improving our accounting and financial reporting functions.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	As part of this commitment, we will create a segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and will look to hire additional personnel with technical accounting expertise, including a Chief Financial Officer and Controller, in the second quarter of 2012, to appropriately address non-routine or complex accounting matters.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P6_S2	In addition, we have engaged an outside accounting consultant to provide additional knowledgeable personnel with technical accounting expertise to further support the current accounting personnel at the Company.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Management believes that hiring additional knowledgeable personnel with technical accounting expertise will remedy the following material weaknesses: (A) lack of sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions to achieve adequate segregation of duties; and (B) insufficient personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge, experience, and training in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our complexity and our financial accounting and reporting requirements.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge with the non-routine or technical issues we have encountered in the past will result in both proper recording of these transactions and a much more knowledgeable finance department as a whole.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Due to the fact that our accounting staff consists of an interim Chief Financial Officer and a bookkeeper, additional personnel will also ensure the proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support us if personnel turnover issues within the department occur.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P8_S3	We believe this will eliminate or greatly decrease any control and procedure issues we may encounter in the future.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Effective October 7, 2011, we entered into a reverse merger transaction, pursuant to which our sole officer and director resigned, and new officers and directors were appointed.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Other than the change in the officers and the board of directors, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P13_S0	(c) Management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P14_S2	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2011 for the reasons discussed above.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P15_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report by EisnerAmper LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_12_ITEM9A_P15_S1	As a smaller reporting company, our management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.
1430306_12_ITEM10_P0_S0	The names of our executive officers and directors and their age, title, and biography as of March 20, 2012 are set forth below:

1430306_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Tonix Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tonix and Krele is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tonix Sub.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We were incorporated on November 16, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Tamandare Explorations Inc. From inception through October 2011, we were involved in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties in the State of Nevada.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	On October 7, 2011 ( Closing Date and the closing of the share exchange transaction, the Closing ), we executed and consummated a share exchange agreement by and among Tonix Sub and the stockholders of 100% of the equity securities of Tonix Sub, including, the holders of 5,207,500 shares of common stock, 1,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 2,275,527 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the Tonix Shareholders ), on the one hand, and us and David Moss ( Moss ), our then sole officer and director and majority shareholder, on the other hand (the Share Exchange Agreement and the transaction, the Share Exchange ).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	In the Share Exchange, the Tonix Shareholders exchanged their shares of Tonix Sub for newly issued shares of our common stock ( Common Stock ).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	As a result, upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Shareholders received an aggregate of 22,666,667 shares of our Common Stock.

1430306_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	As a result of the Share Exchange, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Tonix Sub and consequently, control of the business and operations of Tonix Sub and Krele.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	From and after the Closing Date of the Share Exchange, our primary operations consist of the business and operations of Tonix Sub and Krele.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	On October 11, 2011, we changed our name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. to reflect our new business.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 1996, Seth Lederman, MD, and Donald Landry, MD, PhD, formed L L Technologies, LLC, or L L, to develop medications for CNS conditions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Dr. Lederman is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Landry is a Director.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	L L was a founder of Janus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which later became Vela Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vela, which developed various therapeutics, including a very low dose, or VLD, version of cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, under an agreement with L L. Vela decided to focus its resources on other programs and transferred the rights to VLD CBP and certain other technologies to L L in March 2006.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Tonix Sub formed in June 2007 as Krele Pharmaceuticals, Inc. by L L and Plumbline LLC, or Plumbline.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Dr. Lederman is Managing Partner of Plumbline.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Plumbline possessed rights to certain technology for the treatment of alcohol dependence and abuse.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	In connection with founding Tonix Sub, L L and Plumbline entered into an intellectual property transfer and assignment agreement with Tonix Sub for the purpose of assigning patents and transferring intellectual property and know-how in exchange for shares of common stock of Tonix Sub.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	As a result of economic conditions related to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, Tonix Sub was not successful in raising money to fund its programs until 2009.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	As a result, Tonix Sub was unable to advance the development programs and had little activity except for prosecuting and maintaining patents and maintaining contracts.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation to analyze the sleep data from a Phase 2a trial of bedtime VLD CBP in fibromyalgia, or FM (the Moldofsky Study ).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Moldofsky Study was conducted in Canada by the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation, and Tonix Sub obtained the data from this study from L L.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	In addition, in 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with Caliper Life Sciences Inc., or Caliper, to analyze the interactions of CBP with certain receptors.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	In June 2010, Tonix Sub entered into consulting agreements with L L and Lederman Co., LLC, or Lederman Co, and also acquired certain rights to develop isometheptene mucate as a treatment for certain types of headaches from Lederman Co, which we are developing as TNX-201.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P15_S4	Dr. Lederman is managing partner of Lederman Co. Between June 2010 and October 2011, Tonix Sub was active in recruiting new officers and directors and initiating preclinical and clinical development of novel CBP formulations.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Lederman Co predominantly provides us with clinical development expertise.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	L L predominantly provided us with scientific development expertise until the termination of the consulting agreement in June 2012.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Relative to traditional pharmaceutical development companies, we can be considered a virtual company, since we contract with third-party vendors to provide many functions that are core to traditional pharmaceutical companies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	For example, we have contracted with PharmaNet Canada to develop methods for analyzing CBP in the blood and to conduct human clinical studies to evaluate the performance of our formulation technology.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Lederman Co is responsible for overseeing the scientific and technical aspects of PharmaNet s contract work product.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	In July 2010, Tonix Sub changed its name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	In August 2010, Tonix Sub formed Krele.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel pharmaceutical products for challenging disorders of the CNS.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	We search for potential therapeutic solutions among known pharmaceutical agents that lack regulatory approval for the indications we seek, but may be approved for use in other indications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	The ongoing evolution in the understanding of certain CNS disorders provides us with opportunities to develop such agents as proprietary products for new indications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	We typically seek to create new dose and formulation options that are tailored to the therapeutic uses to which we apply these agents.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Many CNS drugs have been identified by physicians who observe unexpected improvements in their patients CNS conditions despite being prescribed for a different purpose.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	One of our goals is to establish formal clinical study programs to determine if such anecdotal observations are, in fact, reflections of a compound s ability to treat a particular CNS condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	While some new applications can use the commercially-available form of a given drug, in other cases, reformulating the active ingredient may improve the active ingredient s safety or effectiveness in treating the condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	If we demonstrate success in our formal development programs, we will seek marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	We are currently devoting the majority of our efforts to the development of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 sublingual tablet, or TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	TNX-102 SL is a novel dose and formulation of CBP, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two widely prescribed muscle relaxant products, Flexeril and Amrix.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	TNX-102 SL is distinct from these products as it is being developed at a dose level significantly below the lowest marketed doses of Flexeril and Amrix.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	TNX-102 SL is also distinct from these products with regard to its route of administration, as it is designed to be placed under the tongue and disintegrated to provide sublingual absorption, whereas Flexeril and Amrix are designed to be swallowed.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	TNX-102 SL is also intended for chronic use, whereas Flexeril and Amrix are marketed for two to three weeks of use.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	We are currently developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM under an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, filed in the US, and under three Clinical Trial Applications, or CTAs, filed in Canada.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S6	We are also developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, for which we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P22_S7	We expect that any applications we submit for FDA approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of FDCA, which we believe will allow for a shorter timeline of clinical development as compared to that needed to fulfill the requirements of Section 505(b)(1), under which NCEs are generally reviewed.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP for sublingual administration at bedtime.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	We designed TNX-102 SL to enable the efficient delivery of CBP to the systemic circulation via sublingual transmucosal absorption and to avoid first-pass liver metabolism.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	We also designed TNX-102 SL to provide CBP at doses lower than those currently available.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	We have conducted several clinical and pre-clinical pharmacokinetic studies of TNX-102 SL which we believe support its development as a novel therapeutic product for FM and PTSD, and which demonstrate a number of potentially advantageous characteristics as compared to current CBP-containing products, none of which are approved for these indications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	Based on our Phase 1 comparative study, we have observed that, as compared to oral CBP tablets, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following administration.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	TNX-102 SL was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in this study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness on the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration, and other side-effects reported were similar to those associated with current CBP products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	As a result of these promising results, we are advancing TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	We held a Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013, at which we discussed the design of the clinical program, including the acceptability of the pivotal study design and the proposed registration plan, to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	We believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled safety and efficacy studies and the completion of long-term open-label safety exposure studies would support the approval of TNX-102 SL by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P25_S3	Under the IND, we plan to initiate a potential pivotal efficacy trial (Phase 2b) in FM in the third quarter of 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We are also advancing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012, and we plan to file an IND for this indication in the third quarter of 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	We then plan to conduct a clinical proof-of-concept trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	CBP is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	CBP has been approved by the FDA in the U.S. since 1977.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	We have utilized drug delivery technology to produce new formulations of CBP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	In addition to CBP, TNX-102 SL contains excipients, which are well-characterized, are listed in the Inactive Ingredient Guide and are approved for pharmaceutical use.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S3	As a result, we anticipate seeking FDA marketing approval of TNX-102 SL through a 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S4	As one of three types of new drug applications, the 505(b)(2) NDA allows drug companies to obtain FDA approval of new drug products without having to conduct the full complement of safety and efficacy trials, which is often the most time-consuming and expensive part of the drug development process.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S5	As the 505(b)(2) NDA permits the drug manufacturer to rely on the agency s findings for a previously-approved drug, published literature, or both, it permits the FDA to make some safety and effectiveness determinations through the review of materials in the public domain or in already approved NDAs of products containing CBP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P28_S6	The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would spare us some of the burden of generating all of this data for ourselves and may allow TNX-102 SL to progress through a shorter development pathway than is typical for pharmaceutical products based on novel active ingredients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	We have not filed an NDA for TNX-102 SL for any indications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	In addition to TNX-102 SL, we have developed other innovative formulations of CBP, including TNX-102 promicellar gelatin capsule, or TNX-102 gelcap.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	We have developed TNX-102 gelcap under an agreement with Lipocine, a contract formulation developer and small-scale manufacturer.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Although we had met with the FDA to discuss the TNX-102 gelcap development program in August 2011 and we have generated clinical data that support the further development of TNX-102 gelcap, we currently do not plan to advance this candidate.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-201 and TNX-301.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	TNX-201 is based on isometheptene mucate and is under development as a treatment for certain types of headaches.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	For competitive reasons, we do not disclose the identities of the active ingredients or targeted indications in our pipeline until a U.S. patent has been allowed or issued.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Consistent with our mission, these product candidates are or likely will be reformulations of active ingredients that have been used in humans in other products and that are designed for new CNS therapeutic indications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	In other cases, the products will be formulated to match predicate products closely enough to be considered generic copies or similarly enough to other marketed products to rely (in part) on their regulatory review and approval, as well as available published data.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The predicate product may be approved by the FDA under an NDA or may have been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the National Academy of Sciences under the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, or DESI, program, in which case they would be considered by FDA to be unapproved products .
1430306_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	For DESI products, it is our intent to develop NDA versions to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and the International Conference on Harmonisation, or ICH, requirements to seek approval under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Because of our size and being in the development stage, we do not currently devote a significant amount of time or resources towards our other pipeline candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	We may perform non-clinical development work on TNX-201 and possibly on TNX-301, but we do not expect to start clinical trials of either of these candidates until 2014 at the earliest.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	The process to bring a new drug formulation from concept through testing to approval for a new indication by the FDA is a time-consuming, costly and high-risk process.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Once a drug formulation has been tested in laboratories, we need to conduct clinical trials of the product candidate to test its uptake into the blood stream, elimination, effectiveness and safety.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Neither laboratory nor animal studies predict the properties of drugs in humans, so designing new formulations can result in a large number of unexpected outcomes.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Phase 1 studies are performed by administering new drug formulations to a limited number of healthy human volunteers and are designed to test the initial concept of the drug formulation and to determine the correct dosage to be tested subsequently on patients affected with the target disorder.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The initial Phase 1 studies can take up to a year or more to complete, however, since we reformulate versions of approved drugs for new uses, we may need to devote less time to Phase 1 studies since our testing is informed by significant prior human research that we believe allows us to reduce the possible safety-related outcomes.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	The next step in the process is to conduct a proof-of-concept efficacy study to identify the effective dose(s).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	A small Phase 2a efficacy study in the representative patient population will use either a pilot formulation or the formulation selected for further development.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	A larger study in which the selected formulation has been optimized for the target indication can be referred to as a first pivotal study, a Phase 2b study or a Phase 3 study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	If the results of this study are positive and are accepted by the FDA as fulfilling the requirements of a registrational study, then this study may be considered to be one of the two pivotal studies typically required for drug approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The first pivotal study for a condition like FM typically takes a year to complete and two to three months for data analysis.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	If the first pivotal study suggests the drug is safe and effective, then a second pivotal confirmatory Phase 3 study is conducted.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	The second pivotal study in FM typically takes 18 months to complete including data analysis.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	To meet the ICH long-term safety exposure requirement, we plan to conduct one or more long-term safety exposure studies of TNX-102 SL to support the chronic use of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	Assuming our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM meets with success, we would submit an NDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S5	We believe it would take approximately six months to prepare and file the NDA and another 14 months to obtain final FDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S6	The drug could be marketed shortly after FDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P41_S7	Therefore, it typically takes more than five years to bring a new formulation of an approved drug to market for a different indication, and any delays in the process, such as lack of capital necessary to run clinical trials, unexpected results, adverse effects, or difficulty in recruiting willing subjects for trials, would result in additional time before a drug could be approved for marketing.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	In August 2010, we formed Krele to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate NDA products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	We anticipate that when our branded products lose patent protection, Krele may market authorized generic versions of them.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Krele also may develop or acquire generic products approved under ANDAs and we may market branded versions (branded generics) of such products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Krele has been issued a state license in New York.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat CNS conditions, including FM and PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	The principal components of our strategy to achieve this objective are to:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	enter into collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies with respect to, among others, our FM and PTSD product candidates and other products that will benefit from development or marketing resources beyond those in our Company.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Pursue development and regulatory approval pathways .
1430306_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe our lead product candidates may be approvable under pathways that are potentially shorter than those typically available for drug products based on novel active ingredients (Section 505(b)(1)).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	By focusing on developing new formulations of approved drugs for new uses, we believe that we will be able to use the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for NDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	This pathway can reduce the time and expense required for our development programs by allowing our use of previously-generated safety and efficacy information regarding the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our lead product candidates to support the filing and approval of our NDA application.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Our use of this information may help reduce the size and scope of our preclinical and clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The FDA has strict requirements on the marketing of drugs, and FDA approves each drug for specific uses which are called the label indications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	The use of a drug product for the treatment of a condition other than one of its approved label indications is called off-label use.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	The development of an existing FDA-approved drug for the treatment of a condition other than one of its approved label indications is considered a new use .
1430306_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	For companies involved in the ethical development and marketing of prescription drugs in the US, FDA approval of a new use or new label indication is the only legal basis of marketing claims for that use or indication.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	Off-label use is not recognized by the FDA or FDA-regulated companies as a new use.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	We are pursuing a multi-pronged patent strategy by seeking intellectual property protection on several aspects of our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Aspects we seek to protect include, among others, methods of use for certain known active pharmaceutical ingredients, formulation technologies incorporated into our products, and performance characteristics of our products in the human body.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	With respect to methods of use patents, we believe the therapeutic uses we target are new uses for these active ingredients and we have been issued patents directed to certain aspects of our new uses.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	For example, the invention of bedtime VLD CBP as a treatment for FM was novel and unexpected when our patents were filed in 2000.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	We are seeking additional patents to cover other new uses.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S5	For example, we filed a patent application seeking to protect the use of CBP in PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S6	With respect to formulation patents, we believe our products will be protected by patents that describe inventions of technology for making new formulations, which may include novel routes of delivery for the active ingredients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S7	With respect to patents related to the performance characteristics of our products in the human body, we believe our products will be protected by patents that describe novel pharmacokinetic properties of the active ingredient, as well as of its active metabolites, at certain times after administration.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P48_S8	For example, we filed a patent application seeking to protect novel pharmacokinetic properties of CBP as enabled by TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Provide clear value propositions to third-party payors to merit reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	We are designing our clinical development programs to demonstrate compelling competitive advantages to patients and prescribers and also to demonstrate value propositions to third-party payors.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	We believe TNX-102 SL might help in the management of FM by reducing pain and other symptoms, such as fatigue.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	In addition, we believe that bedtime treatment with TNX-102 SL will have fewer day time side-effects than off-label bedtime treatment with immediate-release CBP, or CBP IR.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	For FM, we believe an FDA-approved product would capture some of the off-label use of generic CBP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	Because FDA approvals are based on objective data, we believe that third-party payors will provide reimbursement for an FDA approved product, even at a premium price relative to other drugs that are used off-label, such as CBP IR, tizanidine, baclofen, carisoprodol or metaxalone.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P49_S6	For example, third-party payors reimburse the use of Lyrica and Cymbalta for FM despite the availability of off-label generic versions of drugs with similar mechanisms of action, for example, Neurontin (gabapentin) and generic anti-depressants, respectively.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Enter into collaborations to maximize the value of our technology .
1430306_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe certain of our drug development candidates, including TNX-102 SL, can be developed and marketed more effectively by companies that already have significant drug development and marketing capabilities.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	We will seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of these product candidates at the times we believe most effective.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our lead product candidate is TNX-102 SL, for the treatment of FM and PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	TNX-102 SL consists of CBP in a mixture of inactive ingredients that are called excipients , which we believe will improve the absorption rate of CBP in ways that will optimize the product for bedtime treatment.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	The excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved by the FDA for pharmaceutical uses.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	CBP was first synthesized in 1961 by Merck, and the 10 mg Flexeril immediate-release, or IR, dose form was FDA approved in 1977 for the relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Although a number of clinical studies have addressed the potential use and benefit of CBP in treating symptoms of FM, to our knowledge these studies have not motivated a sponsor to pursue FDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Based on CBP s safety and efficacy for treating muscle spasm, in the 1990s, Merck conducted studies to support an application to market a 5 mg Flexeril tablet (low dose) for the over-the-counter, or OTC, market, whereby patients can purchase medicine without a physician s prescription.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Although Merck s studies re-affirmed the safety and demonstrated efficacy of 5 mg Flexeril in several large trials, the OTC division of the FDA rejected the application for use without a prescription, apparently, we believe, because muscle spasm was deemed a condition that required a physician to diagnose and supervise treatment.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	Merck divested the Flexeril franchise to Alza Pharmaceuticals, or Alza.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Alza subsequently was acquired by Johnson and Johnson and Flexeril is part of their McNeil Specialty Pharmaceuticals division.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	Based largely on the Merck studies, McNeil won approval of Flexeril 5 mg tablets as a prescription medicine to treat muscle spasm.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	McNeil promoted Flexeril 5 mg tablets for the three year period of market exclusivity based on The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, generally referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	Following this exclusivity period, several generics entered the market and took market share from Flexeril.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	McNeil has discontinued the manufacture of Flexeril.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Despite the approved uses of CBP in treating muscle spasm, we believe current marketed formulations of CBP are limited for treating FM by slow and unpredictable absorption.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	Following the ingestion of CBP IR, it takes more than one hour for clinically-meaningful blood levels to be achieved.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	As described in the Flexeril package insert, the amount of CBP absorbed into the bloodstream varies between 33-55% of the dose ingested.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	The variability in absorption may be due to several factors, including effects of the stomach pH (acidity or base) on the dissolution of the tablets, as well as the context of either an empty stomach or a recent meal.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	Food in the stomach and small intestine from a recent meal contributes to variability in absorbing other drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P58_S4	The uncertainties in absorption rates make it challenging for a physician contemplating a bedtime treatment for FM to ensure the intended therapeutic effect is achieved without risking side effects like next-day drowsiness, which could result if the patient has too much CBP remaining in the bloodstream the next day.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	If a product could provide rapid and consistent absorption of CBP, patients would be more likely to receive a drug exposure profile that is aligned with the intended period of exposure and less likely to receive too little drug to receive a therapeutic effect.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	Conversely, patients would be less likely to be over-dosed, which might lead to potential side effects, including next-day drowsiness.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	An optimal VLD CBP product could have faster absorption, faster clearance and more predictable effects than the IR tablet format.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	We have tested a number of technologies to optimize the properties of VLD CBP as a bedtime therapy for FM and PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	Our lead product, TNX-102 SL is a novel sublingual tablet form of VLD CBP that we have tested in pre-clinical and clinical studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	We intend to enter TNX-102 SL into a potential pivotal clinical trial program in FM in the third quarter of 2013, and into a Phase 2 trial in PTSD in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	We believe the unique properties of TNX-102 SL, as demonstrated by the results of our studies, support its development in both FM and PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P60_S4	We have developed other innovative formulations of CBP, including TNX-102 gelcap.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P60_S5	Although we had met with the FDA to discuss the TNX-102 gelcap development program in August 2011 and we have generated clinical data that support the further development of TNX-102 gelcap, we currently do not plan to advance this candidate.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	TNX-102 SL, our most advanced product candidate, is a rapidly disintegrating tablet containing VLD CBP that is designed to be placed under the tongue at bedtime.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	The development of TNX-102 SL in FM is supported by the results of the Moldofsky Study, which evaluated oral administration of CBP at doses below the lowest marketed dose in the evening, as well as by preclinical and comparative clinical pharmacokinetic studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the Moldofsky Study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2a trial, it was demonstrated that VLD CBP in a capsule swallowed between dinner and bedtime resulted in significant decreases in next-day pain and other core FM symptoms, as well as in a significant improvement in sleep quality.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	We believe that CBP exerts its benefit in FM via its ability to improve the restorative quality of sleep, which has been shown to be frequently impaired in patients with FM or PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	Current CBP products are believed to be widely used off-label by FM patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	FM is diagnosed by groups of symptoms that have been defined by committees of the American College of Rheumatology, or ACR, and a committee of experts from the organization Outcome Measures in Rheumatology.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	In 2007, Pfizer s Lyrica (pregabalin) became the first medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	In 2008, Eli Lilly s Cymbalta (duloxetine) became the second medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	In 2009, Savella (milnacipran) was the third medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Savella is marketed by Forest Laboratories.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our motivation to focus our efforts on developing TNX-102 SL for FM stems from the results of the Moldofsky Study, the related rights to which we acquired from L L. Specifically, this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating eight week trial conducted at two study centers.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	The study subjects met ACR criteria for FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	Patients received VLD CBP IR 1 mg capsules or corresponding placebo capsules to ingest after dinner and before bedtime.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	Initially, patients took one capsule each evening, but over the course of the study, they were allowed to increase the number of capsules taken in increments of one capsule per week.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	The maximum number of capsules allowed was four per evening, which would be a total dose of 4 mg CBP IR.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	Patients treated with VLD CBP demonstrated significant improvements in pain, fatigue and tenderness at week 8 relative to baseline, whereas placebo-treated patients did not improve (Figure 1).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	Although this study excluded patients who met formal criteria for major depressive disorder or any anxiety disorder, there is a high degree of co-existing symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	VLD CBP treatment resulted in significant reductions in total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, or HAD, which measures symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the HAD depression subscale which measures depressive symptoms (Figure 1).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	This study showed treatment with VLD CBP:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or discontinuations due to adverse events, or AEs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	This study also showed that VLD CBP taken between dinner and bedtime resulted in a significant improvement in sleep quality.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	We believe that CBP exerts its benefit in FM via its ability to improve the restorative quality of sleep, which has been shown to be frequently impaired in patients with FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	This research was published in the Journal of Rheumatology , in an article entitled Effects of Bedtime Very Low Dose (VLD) Cyclobenzaprine (CBP) on Symptoms and Sleep Physiology in Patients with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FM): A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study.

1430306_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	We have conducted two preclinical and two clinical studies of our sublingual formulations of CBP, which have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of these formulations as well as their bioequivalence to oral CBP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our preclinical animal studies demonstrated that our sublingual formulations provide faster delivery and more efficient systemic absorption of CBP as compared to current oral forms of the drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our first clinical study of sublingual CBP evaluated a solution formulation in which certain key ingredients of TNX-102 SL were delivered under the tongue in a small volume of water.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	This single-dose study was conducted in Canada.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	The trial enrolled 23 healthy volunteers, and subjects received one of: a sublingual solution containing 2.4 mg of CBP and sublingual absorption-enabling ingredients of TNX-102 SL (Arm 1), a sublingual solution that was designed to simulate crushed CBP IR tablets, i.e., without the sublingual absorption-enabling ingredients (2.4 mg) (Arm 2), an oral CBP IR tablet (5 mg) (Arm 3), or intravenous CBP (2.4 mg) (Arm 4).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S3	The study measured circulating blood levels of CBP at pre-defined time-points over six days after receiving study medication.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S4	Patients receiving sublingual formulations were instructed to spit and rinse 90 seconds following administration.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S5	The results demonstrated that the solution formulation of TNX-102 SL (Arm 1) delivered CBP to the systemic circulation more efficiently than the sublingual solution of a simulated crushed tablet (Arm 2) and faster than the ingested tablet (Arm 3).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P76_S6	In the study, all of the CBP formulations were well-tolerated, and there were no unexpected adverse events.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Our second clinical study of sublingual CBP evaluated TNX-102 SL, the sublingual tablet formulation we expect to advance into further development.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	This study was conducted in Canada.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	This study enrolled 24 healthy volunteers and evaluated a single dose of one 2.4 mg tablet or two tablets (4.8 mg) of TNX-102 SL or the currently-marketed 5 mg CBP tablet.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S3	In comparison to oral administration of the 5 mg CBP tablet, both sublingual doses of TNX-102 SL demonstrated faster systemic absorption.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S4	After administration of TNX-102 SL, blood levels of CBP were significantly higher at 20, 30, 45 and 60 minutes relative to administration of the 5 mg CBP tablet.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S5	In the study, TNX-102 SL was generally well tolerated.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P77_S6	There were no unexpected adverse events, with the exception of a mild, temporary numbness at the tongue experienced by less than one-third of the subjects that received TNX-102 SL tablets.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	We expect to advance the clinical development of TNX-102 SL, containing 2.8 mg CBP, for the management of FM by conducting a Phase 2b study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, FM patients will be administered either TNX-102 SL or placebo at bedtime nightly for 12 weeks.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	We expect to enroll 100-200 patients into this study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P78_S3	We expect that our proposed Phase 2b study, if successful and accepted by the FDA, will be one of the two pivotal studies required to support the NDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	We expect the primary efficacy measure in this study will be the change in pain severity at week 12 with TNX-102 SL as compared to placebo, as assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale, or NRS.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	This endpoint is similar to that utilized by drug products currently approved for use in FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	We will also collect information on other outcome measures, including NRS scores at other timepoints, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and the Patient Global Impression of Change.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	We expect to engage a clinical research organization, or CRO, to conduct and manage this study under our direction.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P79_S4	Subsequent to receiving FDA concurrence with our proposed protocol, including the methodology for primary endpoint analysis, the study will begin enrollment in the third quarter of 2013 and will be completed in the second half of 2014.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P79_S5	We have contracted with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to manufacture and perform stability testing on TNX-102 SL tablets for this Phase 2b study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Since CBP will be used chronically in TNX-102 SL, we will study TNX-102 SL in comparison to CBP IR in a multiple-day dosing (once daily) study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Subjects will receive TNX-102 SL or CBP IR for four or more consecutive days.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	Peak and trough blood levels of CBP will be measured.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	The results of this study will provide information regarding blood levels of CBP resulting from use of the marketed IR tablet and our sublingual TNX-102 SL tablet when taken in a multiple day regimen.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P80_S4	We expect the data from this study to serve as a bridge , in that they will allow us to use the CBP IR tablet as the reference product in our submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	We plan to conduct a small study designed to evaluate next morning drowsiness and other cognitive measures following the bedtime use of TNX-102 SL and the bedtime use of CBP IR.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	The goal of this study is to determine the potential benefit of TNX-102 SL compared with CBP IR on next morning drowsiness and on other cognitive functions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	If our Phase 2b study of TNX-102 SL is successful, then we expect to conduct a Phase 3 confirmatory study in support of product registration.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	At that time, we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in which patients with FM will receive TNX-102 SL or placebo at bedtime nightly for 12 weeks.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	It is likely that the primary efficacy measure in this study will be the change in pain severity with TNX-102 SL as compared to placebo at week 12, assessed by the NRS, similar to the primary efficacy measure of the Phase 2b study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	Secondary outcome measures will be carefully considered to best support desired label claims and to optimize the marketing message for product differentiation.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	We expect approximately 300 FM patients will be enrolled in this trial.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	To evaluate the safety of TNX-102 SL for chronic use, we expect to conduct one or more long-term open-label safety exposure studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	The FDA agreed that the safety database needed to support a 505(b)(2) NDA submission for TNX-102 SL would contain a total exposure of at least 300 FM patients, with at least 100 patients receiving TNX-102 SL for six months and at least 50 patients for one year.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P84_S2	We plan to conduct open-label extension studies in which patients may be eligible to enroll following their completion of our Phase 2b and Phase 3 safety and efficacy trials in FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	The FDA approvals of Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella establish a regulatory approval standard for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	However, given the heterogeneity of patients with this disease, it may not prove to be the only pathway or approval requirement.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	We hope to register TNX-102 SL with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	This regulatory pathway may help to accelerate product development and reduce overall business risk.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	The 505(b)(2)-based product development plan for TNX-102 SL is designed to leverage the safety data that have been generated by other manufacturers for CBP-containing products and accepted by the FDA in support of their product registrations, in addition to the safety data we generate.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	TNX-102 SL contains significantly less active CBP than other marketed products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	We believe that the safety data package from these products and the CBP prescriptions utilization database analyzed by IMS Health Incorporated will provide adequate safety margin to support TNX-102 SL development.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	We held a Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013, at which we discussed the nature and extent of the Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials we need to conduct to so as to receive regulatory acceptance of our proposed NDA plan for a differentiated product for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	If NDA approval of TNX-102 SL is granted, in addition to the three-year marketing exclusivity granted by law, we expect this product to be protected by patents that extend through at least 2021, during which time it should not be subject to generic substitution.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	We plan to continue to support the TNX-102 SL program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and in FM patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	For example, we have recently filed patent applications on TNX-102 SL which, if issued, would be expected to provide protection from generic substitution until 2033.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	We are also developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD, a psychiatric disorder that begins in the aftermath of traumatic experiences.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012, at which our clinical program for PTSD was discussed.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	We have not yet conducted any clinical trials on PTSD patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	A number of parallels have been noted between FM and PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	In addition, symptom overlaps may exist between patients diagnosed with FM or PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P90_S2	Res. 2006, 61(5):663-9), 49% of PTSD patients met the ACR criteria for FM compared to 5% of major depression patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P90_S3	Arthritis Rheum. 2002, 32(1):38-50), 57% of the sample had symptoms associated with PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	A core feature of PTSD is sleep disturbance, including insomnia and nightmares.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	Sleep disturbances are believed to exacerbate daytime symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, poor concentration, and diminished interest in significant activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P91_S2	We believe the sleep disturbances of PTSD bear similarity to those associated with FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Paxil (paroxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline) are FDA approved for PTSD, but are not satisfactory treatments for many patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	Other drugs that show promise for the treatment of PTSD, but are not FDA approved, include antidepressants such as nefazodone, mirtazapine and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; certain atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone; and an adrenergic alpha-1 receptor blocker, prazosin.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P92_S2	Prazosin may decrease nightmares and insomnia and has been associated with improvements in daytime PTSD symptoms, depression, and quality of life.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Our rationale for studying the effects of CBP in PTSD derives from the following:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	in studies conducted by Caliper, CBP interacts with a receptor on brain cells called the serotonin type 2a receptor.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	Based on numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications, we have identified a number of compounds that bind this receptor that have been shown to have effects in treating PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	Therefore, it is our belief that CBP, because it binds to the serotonin type 2a receptor, will have a therapeutic effect in treating PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	As very little information was available on the biochemical effects of CBP and its primary metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine, or nCBP, in the central nervous system, we have engaged several CROs to better understand the interactions of these agents with certain receptors in the brain.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P95_S1	CROs we have engaged in this effort include Caliper, Cerep, Millipore, and DiscoveRx.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P95_S2	Results from a series of binding and functional studies show that both of these molecules are potent antagonists of the serotonin type 2a and the histamine H1 receptors, which known to have effects on sleep and sleep maintenance.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P95_S3	The results also show that CBP and nCBP antagonize the adrenergic alpha 1A and 1B receptors, which may have effects on autonomic dysfunction.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	We anticipate that the dose of TNX-102 SL sufficient to treat PTSD symptoms may be higher than that sufficient to treat FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	We plan to utilize the data obtained from our pharmacokinetic studies of TNX-102 SL to inform the design of efficacy trials in PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	Based on the recommendations and guidance received at our October 2012 pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we plan to file an IND application for TNX-102 SL in the PTSD indication in the third quarter of 2013, and to conduct a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	We expect to be able to use TNX-102 SL tablets manufactured for the FM studies in the initial PTSD clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	We plan to use the IND to support a small clinical study to ascertain the potential efficacy of TNX-102 SL in this disorder.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in subjects with PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P98_S2	TNX-102 SL and placebo will be administered once daily at bedtime.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P98_S3	The primary efficacy measure will be the change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale from baseline to week six.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P98_S4	Secondary outcome variables may include the PTSD Dream Rating Scale, the PTSD Checklist, the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Beck Depression Inventory.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P98_S5	In addition, polysomnograms may be obtained at baseline and at specified times during the trial.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	If our Phase 2 trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is successful, we intend to conduct two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TNX-102 SL in patients with PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	We expect both of these Phase 3 studies to be of 12 weeks duration and of crossover design.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	We expect the results of the Phase 2 trial to determine dose levels in these Phase 3 trials, but like the Phase 2 trial, TNX-102 SL may be dosed flexibly.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P99_S3	The primary endpoints for both Phase 3 studies are anticipated to be similar to those proposed to be featured in the Phase 2 study, and as with the Phase 2 study, in addition to standardized measures of PTSD symptomatology and severity, polysomnograms may be obtained.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	The approvals by the FDA of Paxil (paroxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline) for treating PTSD establish a regulatory approval pathway for symptom reduction in PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	We believe our clinical development program of TNX-102 SL and the chronic safety data generated from the TNX-102 SL FM NDA program will result in a differentiated product suitable for chronic use for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P100_S2	We believe that our planned clinical trials in PTSD, if successful, will provide sufficient evidence of clinical efficacy and safety to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small tablet that rapidly disintegrates in saliva and transmucosally delivers CBP into the systemic circulation.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	TNX-102 SL contains sublingual absorption-enabling ingredients that promote a local oral environment that facilitates oromucosal absorption of CBP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	In June 2007, we entered into a Feasibility and Option Agreement with Lipocine, which was amended in October 2010 (the Feasibility Agreement ).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	Pursuant to the Feasibility Agreement, we identified and obtained an exclusive worldwide option on technology from Lipocine that employs mixtures of different types of lipids to envelop CBP molecules in the small intestine and facilitate absorption into the bloodstream.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P103_S2	We believe this approach has potential for more consistent absorption and decreased variability in blood levels.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Feasibility Agreement provided for two stages of work, stated as Stage I and Stage II.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	The Stage I work involved developing methods and testing compatibility between Lipocine s technology and our drug formulation.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	The Stage II work involved supporting us in our efforts to conduct a clinical trial study, based on the Stage I work, and is expected to conclude upon the completion of a final report on the results of the clinical study (the Final Report ).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	Upon completion of the Final Report, we have the right, within 30 days after the Final Report, to exercise an exclusive worldwide license to the Lipocine technology.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	Under the Feasibility Agreement, Lipocine completed the Stage I work, which involved studying a number of combinations of lipids for their ability to form micelles that solubilize the free base of CBP and which might serve as inactive ingredients in a gelatin capsule formulation.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	We selected a candidate formulation, TNX-102 gelcap, based on properties that included the dispersion of the active ingredient in simulated gastric or small-intestinal fluids and the stability of the formulation over time prior to testing.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	Lipocine was also engaged to manufacture gelatin capsules of TNX-102 gelcap for use in a pharmacokinetic trial.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	In August 2011, we provided notice to Lipocine that we intended to move forward with the Stage II work.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	The clinical phase of the Stage II trial was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	Some of the data has been collected and some data is still awaiting the development and validation of assays.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	We are working to analyze the data and write the Final Report, which is anticipated to be completed in 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	After completion of the Final Report, we will have 30 days to decide whether to exercise the option to license Lipocine s US patent 6,294,192 Triglyceride-free compositions and methods for improved delivery of hydrophobic therapeutic agents and US Patent 6,451,339 Compositions and methods for improved delivery of hydrophobic agents .
1430306_13_ITEM1_P106_S5	These patents expire on September 24, 2021 and September 16, 2022, respectively.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	If we elect to exercise the option, we will execute a license agreement with Lipocine.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	If we exercise the option to license these patents, we will be obligated to pay Lipocine low single-digit percentage royalties based on net sales or mid-teen sublicense fees based on the consideration that we receive from a licensee.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P107_S2	The maximum amount of milestone payments we could be required to pay to Lipocine pursuant to the Feasibility Agreement is $3,000,000.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P107_S3	We currently do not plan to exercise the option with Lipocine.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P108_S0	We believe the U.S. market for products that treat CNS conditions has several characteristics that make it an attractive market for pharmaceuticals, including that the customer base is driven by physicians who are involved in long-term care of patients with chronic disorders.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P109_S0	Patients with CNS disorders sometimes carry disease burdens that require long-term treatment.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P110_S0	We believe the market for FDA-approved FM treatments is underserved and that there is a constant need for new treatment options, since many prescription drugs provide relief only to some of the affected patients, only to some of some patients symptoms, or provide relief only for limited periods of time.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P111_S0	In 2007, Lyrica (pregabalin) became the first medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P111_S1	Lyrica previously had been approved and marketed to treat pain in other conditions as well as epilepsy.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P111_S2	In 2008, Cymbalta (duloxetine) became the second medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P111_S3	Cymbalta previously had been approved and marketed to treat depression.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P112_S0	FM shares a number of symptoms with depression, and a number of FM patients are believed to experience depression as a co-existing condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P113_S0	Savella (milnacipran) was the third medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P114_S0	Savella s active ingredient, milnacipran, is approved for the treatment of depression in Europe.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P115_S0	As many products used for the treatment of FM are approved and marketed for other conditions, sales of these products related specifically to FM can only be estimated.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P115_S1	According to Decision Resources, U.S. sales of prescription drugs specifically for the treatment of FM totaled $1.4 billion in 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P115_S2	This figure includes sales of Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella of $595 million, $504 million, and $110 million, respectively.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P116_S0	Despite the availability of FDA approved products, we believe the current treatment options for FM continue to leave many patients dissatisfied.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P117_S0	Prior to 2007, the landscape of prescription drugs used to treat FM was characterized by off-label use of generically-available therapies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P117_S1	Drugs that had been prescribed as the primary treatments for FM were approved for other indications, with analgesics, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants among the categories receiving the greatest use by the FM population.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P117_S2	Despite the significant FM-related sales growth of the three products approved for FM following their approvals for this indication, according to Adivo Associates, the unit volume of medications prescribed to specifically treat FM has been nearly flat since 2007, implying that the sales growth of the approved products was mainly driven by patients switching from off-label, generic medications to on-label, branded medications.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P117_S3	In particular, these market dynamics are consistent with the interpretation that Lyrica s growth in FM was driven by switching from off-label analgesics, and Cymbalta s and Savella s growth in FM was driven by switching from off-label anti-depressants.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P118_S0	Despite the wide use of muscle relaxants by FM patients, this category lacks a product approved for FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P118_S1	Demand continues to be satisfied by off-label medicines such as CBP, tizanidine, baclofen, carisoprodol and metaxalone.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P118_S2	These muscle relaxants have generic and branded versions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P118_S3	According to Adivo Associates, 20 million daily doses of the Flexeril brand and its associated CBP IR generic products were prescribed off-label for FM in 2011 and accounted for approximately 48% of the daily doses of muscle relaxants prescribed for FM that year.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P118_S4	These figures indicate that muscle relaxants in general, and CBP in particular, have been widely adopted in FM despite the lack of an approval for this disorder.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P119_S0	Developers of pharmaceutical treatments for syndromes and disorders that affect the CNS face special challenges.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P120_S0	In many cases, the causes and exacerbating factors of CNS conditions remain unknown.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P120_S1	Frequently, key symptoms are known only by patient reports and cannot be objectively validated or measured.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P120_S2	Symptoms like pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep or altered mood are characteristics of more than one condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P120_S3	Often, physicians may not agree that a particular patient is affected by one or another condition or by more than one co-existing conditions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P121_S0	CNS conditions are typically defined by committees of expert professionals who set criteria based on the presence of several symptoms or groups of symptoms.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P121_S1	Sometimes groups of subjective symptoms are insufficient to describe CNS disorders and further refinement of diagnostic categories can be achieved by patient demographics, such as gender, age or concurrent medical processes, such as menopause or adolescence.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P122_S0	Many CNS conditions, including syndromes and disorders, have not yet been characterized by laboratory tests, such as blood tests or x-ray imaging.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P122_S1	However, laboratory tests are often important to exclude other conditions, such as inflammatory or infectious processes.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P122_S2	Consequently, a CNS condition is sometimes called a diagnosis of exclusion because inflammation and infection should typically be ruled out by laboratory tests before applying the criteria of groups of symptoms to diagnose it.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P123_S0	Once a CNS condition is diagnosed, physicians may select from among treatment options based on a patient s symptoms and history.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P124_S0	Some medications improve or relieve only one or another symptom in a condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P124_S1	Consequently, physicians may prescribe several different medications concurrently to treat individual symptoms or groups of symptoms.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P125_S0	A desirable quality for CNS medications is the ability to relieve more than one symptom of a CNS condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P125_S1	Another desirable quality for CNS medications is safety, particularly if a medicine is safe enough to be used with other medicines concurrently or at different times of the day.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P126_S0	We believe the market for the treatment of FM is underserved, which we believe fuels a need for new therapeutic options.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P126_S1	Due to the market acceptance of FM treatments (such as Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella), we believe there will be a growing interest in alternative drug treatment options.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P127_S0	We believe that if TNX-102 SL won FDA approval, it would be an appealing option because it has an entirely different mechanism of action from the currently approved products and we expect TNX-102 SL will be recommended for use at bedtime.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P128_S0	Lyrica is recommended for twice or three-times daily dosing.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P128_S1	Cymbalta was found effective at once-daily or twice-daily dosing and is generally restricted to daytime use and not recommended for bedtime use.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P128_S2	Cymbalta and Savella act on the CNS in ways that are believed to interfere with sleep, while data support the view that CBP, the active ingredient in TNX-102 SL, improves sleep quality.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S5	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S6	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P129_S7	Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P130_S0	The markets for medicines to treat FM, PTSD and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P130_S1	Pfizer (Lyrica), Eli Lilly (Cymbalta) and Forest Laboratories/Cyprus Biosciences (Savella) market FDA approved drugs for FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P130_S2	Pfizer (Zoloft) and GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil) market FDA approved drugs for PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P131_S0	As of February 2013, we are aware of several companies pursuing treatments for FM, including Chelsea Therapeutics, Johnson and Johnson, Meda, Pfizer, Synthetic Biologics, Teva, and Theravance.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P131_S1	Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P132_S0	A number of companies are specifically engaged in developing drugs for PTSD, including AstraZeneca, UCB, GlaxoSmithKline, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and Pfizer.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P133_S0	Medications that may be used for the treatment of PTSD include anti-depressants such as: nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine and certain atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P133_S1	Several of these products are supported by companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P134_S0	Proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and processes are important to our business and we seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally when we deem appropriate.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P134_S1	We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to protect various aspects of our core technology.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P134_S2	We require our employees, consultants and scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with us.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P135_S0	We own numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P135_S1	In addition, we have one trademark application pending.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P136_S0	Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P136_S1	Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P136_S2	We cannot assure you that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P137_S0	Our current patents owned are as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P138_S0	Our current patent applications that are pending are as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P139_S0	We have one trademark application that is pending as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P140_S0	We have one employee dedicated to research and development.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P140_S1	We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase several fold as we advance TNX-102 SL into late-stage clinical development and advance other candidates in our pipeline.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P140_S2	We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P140_S3	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P140_S4	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P141_S0	We have contracted with third parties for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL for investigational purposes, including preclinical and clinical testing, as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P142_S0	All of our compounds are small molecules, synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available raw materials.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P143_S1	These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P143_S2	The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P143_S3	Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P144_S0	The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P144_S1	The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P145_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P146_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P147_S0	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P147_S1	The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P147_S2	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P148_S0	The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator s brochure.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P148_S1	An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P148_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P148_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P149_S0	An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P149_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P149_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P150_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P150_S1	Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P151_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P152_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P153_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P154_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P154_S1	Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P155_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P155_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease, but sometimes can include several thousand patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P155_S2	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P156_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P156_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P156_S2	Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P156_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P157_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P158_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P158_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P158_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P159_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P160_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P161_S0	NDAs that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P161_S1	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P161_S2	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P161_S3	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P161_S4	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P162_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P162_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P163_S0	Because we are developing new formulations of previously approved chemical entities, such as CBP, our drug approval strategy is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P163_S1	The FDA may not agree that our product candidates are approvable as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P163_S2	If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for our product candidates, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates could substantially and materially increase, and our products might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P163_S3	If the FDA requires full NDAs for our product candidates, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P163_S4	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P164_S0	Based on our intent to file under Section 505(b)(2) with respect to our lead product candidate, we believe it is unlikely the development process for this product candidate will follow the ordinary course of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P165_S0	Our human pharmacokinetic studies of reformulated CBP dosage forms represented the first use of TNX-102 SL and TNX-102 gelcap, or collectively, TNX-102, in humans and could therefore be described as Phase 1.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P165_S1	However, because these studies compared TNX-102 to existing approved formulations of CBP and specified the comparable ability to deliver effective levels of CBP to the bloodstream of FM patients, these studies provide a reference to the therapeutic effects previously observed in our dose-ranging clinical study of CBP IR capsules in FM patients.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P165_S2	For these reasons, rather than always identifying clinical trials by Phase, we find it more illustrative to describe in a narrative form the purpose of the studies and the nature and potential significance of the results.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P166_S0	Because our double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study on bedtime CBP was performed in Canada, we did not meet with the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to discuss our approach and plans until August 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P166_S1	In February 2013, we held a Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical and nonclinical requirements to register TNX-102 SL for the management of FM based on the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P167_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P167_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed by the FDA for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P167_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P167_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P168_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P169_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P169_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P170_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_13_ITEM1_P170_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P171_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P171_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P171_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P172_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P173_S0	The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P173_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P173_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 1/2 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P173_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P173_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P174_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P175_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P175_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P175_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P175_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P175_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P176_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P176_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P177_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P177_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P177_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P177_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P177_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_13_ITEM1_P178_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P179_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P179_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P180_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P181_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P181_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P181_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P182_S0	In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, became law.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P182_S1	This legislation grants significant new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P182_S2	In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information, and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P182_S3	In addition, the new law significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P182_S4	Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P183_S0	The FDA has not yet implemented many of the provisions of the FDAAA, so we cannot predict the impact of the new legislation on the pharmaceutical industry or our business.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P183_S1	However, the requirements and changes imposed by the FDAAA may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P183_S2	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P183_S3	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P184_S0	As of March 8, 2013, we had two full-time employees, Leland Gershell, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bruce Daugherty, our Senior Director of Drug Development and Controller, as well as one part-time senior director of research.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P185_S0	In addition, we rely on consultants instead of employees for critical activities, including Seth Lederman who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and as President of Tonix Sub pursuant to a consulting agreement with Lederman Co.
1430306_13_ITEM1_P185_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company and its prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of products that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, development and laboratory testing and clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We cannot assure you that we will ever have a product approved by the FDA, that we will bring any product to market or, if we are successful in doing so, that we will ever become profitable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities increase.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm with an explanatory paragraph for the year ended December 31, 2012 with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The existence of such a report may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	There is no assurance that we will not receive a similar report for our year ended December 31, 2013.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In their report dated March 8, 2013, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we have incurred losses since inception of development stage, have a negative cash flow from operations, and require additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have no approved products on the market and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We currently have one lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM, and the success of our business currently depends on its successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	TNX-102 SL has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for this product candidate anywhere in the world.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The clinical development program for TNX-102 SL may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective or the clinical program may be put on hold due to unexpected safety issues with marketed CBP products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approval for TNX-102 SL in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and clinical trials and marketing activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next six months, and we anticipate that we will require additional capital to complete the planned pivotal trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We may, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to initiate clinical trials or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our lead product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors' products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents on products we develop.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the PTO ) and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success depends on our patents, patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine the priority of inventions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, PTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Also, a third party may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	An adverse decision in litigation could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Interference proceedings brought before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to our patents or patent applications.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	During an interference proceeding, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Even if successful, an interference proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	If preclinical testing or clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including CROs and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical testing or clinical trials involving our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical testing or clinical trials than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical testing or clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical trials, consistent with a clinical trial protocol.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Delays in preclinical and clinical testing could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P47_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Once a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If clinical trials are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If we are unable to file for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore possibly obtain a shortened review period for the applications.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We met with the FDA in February 2013 to discuss the development of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, in FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	We had held a pre-IND meeting in August 2011 to discuss initial plans for the development of TNX-102 gelcap in FM.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Although these interactions with the FDA have encouraged our efforts to continue to develop TNX-102 SL for FM, there is no assurance that we will satisfy the FDA s requirements for approval in this indication.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We have not come to any agreement with the FDA as to the nature and extent of studies we may be required to conduct in order to achieve approval of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	The timeline for filing and review of our NDAs is based on our plan to submit those NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, wherein we will rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our lead product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S7	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications, and the FDA may not agree that our products qualify for marketing approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL, and we may need to fulfill the more extensive requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Sub since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Loss of the services of Dr. Lederman would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S3	We have key-man insurance on the life of Dr. Lederman and we recently applied for key-man insurance for Leland Gershell, our Chief Financial Officer, and for Bruce Daugherty, our Senior Director of Drug Development.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S4	We are also highly dependent on our directors and scientific team.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S5	We are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S6	However, we have no employment agreement with Dr. Lederman and while we have employment agreements with certain of our employees, all of our employees may terminate their employment at any time.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P57_S7	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P58_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Moreover, our work force is located in the Pharmaceutical Corridor that spans New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in drug development, product registration, clinical and non-clinical research, quality compliance, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our trials, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We intend to rely on third-party CMOs to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical trials and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates requires manufacturing of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	We have contracted with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds, including TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Although we are in discussions with other manufacturers we have identified as potential alternative CMOs of TNX-102 SL, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms with any of them.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with many of these manufacturers.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P63_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for cGMP compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P67_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P67_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P70_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and our business.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development .
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain .
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain .
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct adequate and well controlled clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P79_S3	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P79_S5	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials; the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically significant safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our clinical trials may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our products are expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our products in clinical development.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operation.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P84_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to a New Drug Application, or NDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P84_S3	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P85_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Following completion of clinical trials, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P89_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs - six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P89_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P89_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA is approved.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	None of our product candidates has been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P100_S3	If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our strategy with our lead product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S4	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S5	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P103_S6	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P104_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P107_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P107_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P108_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P108_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P108_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P108_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	In the event that we are successful in bringing any products to market, our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products successfully may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	other third party payors, including Medicare.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for health care products to be approved in the future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P112_S1	Third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P113_S0	The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P113_S1	If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any prescription product we bring to market, doctors may not prescribe them or patients may ask to have their physicians prescribe competing drugs with more favorable reimbursement.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P114_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P114_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P114_S2	In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P114_S3	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P114_S4	Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators' drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S3	While we currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S4	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S5	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S6	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators' products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P116_S7	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P118_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P118_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P119_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P119_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P120_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P120_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P121_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P121_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P122_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P123_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P124_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P125_S0	There has been a limited trading market for our Common Stock and almost no market activity to date.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Currently, our Common Stock is available for quotation on the OTCQB under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S1	However, prior to February 2012, there was no trading activity in our Common Stock and limited trading has occurred to date.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S2	As of December 31, 2012, trading occurred on only 82 out of 229 possible trading days, with an average of less than 3,200 shares per possible trading day and less than 8,900 shares trades on each day when shares actually traded.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S3	It is anticipated that there will continue to be a limited trading market for the Common Stock on the OTCQB.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S4	The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S5	The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P126_S6	An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using Common Stock as consideration.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P127_S0	You may have difficulty trading and obtaining quotations for our Common Stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Our Common Stock may not be actively traded, and the bid and asked prices for our Common Stock on the OTCQB may fluctuate widely.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P128_S1	As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our securities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P128_S2	This severely limits the liquidity of the Common Stock, and would likely reduce the market price of our Common Stock and hamper our ability to raise additional capital.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P129_S0	The market price for our Common Stock may be volatile, and your investment in our Common Stock could decline in value.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P130_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P130_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P130_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P132_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P133_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Investor relations activities, nominal float and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S0	We utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for our company.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S1	These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S2	We provide compensation to investor relations firms and may pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third-parties based upon publicly-available information concerning our company.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S3	We will not be responsible for the content of analyst reports and other writings and communications by investor relations firms not authored by us or from publicly available information.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S4	We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts reports or other materials based upon analysts own research or methods.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S5	Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S6	In addition, investors in our company may be willing, from time to time, to encourage investor awareness through similar activities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P135_S7	Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market our common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P136_S0	The SEC and FINRA enforce various statutes and regulations intended to prevent manipulative or deceptive devices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security and carefully scrutinize trading patterns and company news and other communications for false or misleading information, particularly in cases where the hallmarks of pump and dump activities may exist, such as rapid share price increases or decreases.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P136_S1	We, and our shareholders may be subjected to enhanced regulatory scrutiny due to the small number of holders who initially will own the registered shares of our common stock publicly available for resale, and the limited trading markets in which such shares may be offered or sold which have often been associated with improper activities concerning penny-stocks, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the OTCQB Marketplace (Pink OTC) or pink sheets.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P136_S2	Until such time as our restricted shares are registered or available for resale under Rule 144, there will continue to be a small percentage of shares held by a small number of investors, many of whom acquired such shares in privately negotiated purchase and sale transactions that will constitute the entire available trading market.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P137_S0	The Supreme Court has stated that manipulative action is a term of art connoting intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P138_S0	Often times, manipulation is associated by regulators with forces that upset the supply and demand factors that would normally determine trading prices.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Since a small percentage of the outstanding common stock of our company will initially be available for trading, held by a small number of individuals or entities, the supply of our common stock for sale will be extremely limited for an indeterminate amount of time, which could result in higher bids, asks or sales prices than would otherwise exist.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Securities regulators have often cited thinly-traded markets, small numbers of holders, and awareness campaigns as components of their claims of price manipulation and other violations of law when combined with manipulative trading, such as wash sales, matched orders or other manipulative trading timed to coincide with false or touting press releases.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P140_S1	There can be no assurance that our or third-parties activities, or the small number of potential sellers or small percentage of stock in the float, or determinations by purchasers or holders as to when or under what circumstances or at what prices they may be willing to buy or sell stock will not artificially impact (or would be claimed by regulators to have affected) the normal supply and demand factors that determine the price of the stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P142_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P142_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P142_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P142_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P144_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P144_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P146_S0	If we or our existing shareholders sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, our stock price may decline.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P147_S0	If we or our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that we or our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock, particularly with respect to our affiliates, directors, executive officers or other insiders, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P148_S0	In the future, we may issue additional shares to our employees, directors or consultants, in connection with corporate alliances or acquisitions, or to raise capital.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P148_S1	Due to these factors, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Our officers, directors and principal shareholders own a controlling interest in our voting stock and investors will not have any voice in our management.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Our officers, directors and principal shareholders, in the aggregate, beneficially own or control the votes of approximately 46.5% of our outstanding Common Stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P150_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P151_S0	adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P152_S0	As a result of their ownership and positions, our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders collectively are able to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P152_S1	In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors, executive officers or principal shareholders, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P152_S2	Management s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Our common stock is not currently traded at high volume, and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell or liquidate a substantial number of shares at one time.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Our common stock is currently traded, but with very low, if any, volume, based on quotations on the OTCQB, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P154_S1	This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is still relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P154_S2	As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P155_S0	We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will be sustained.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P156_S0	Shareholders should be aware that, according to Commission Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P156_S1	Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P157_S0	Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P157_S1	Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P157_S2	The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the future volatility of our share price.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Efforts to comply with recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and require additional management resources, and we still may fail to comply.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P159_S0	As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, in the event we are no longer a smaller reporting company, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements would be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P159_S1	Such attestation requirement by our independent registered public accounting firm would not be applicable to us until the report for the year ended December 31, 2013 at the earliest, if at all.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P159_S2	If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is required to, but is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P161_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P161_S1	For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P162_S0	the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P163_S0	In order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P164_S0	make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P165_S0	The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P166_S0	that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P167_S0	Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P167_S1	This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P168_S1	Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P169_S0	FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P170_S0	In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P170_S1	Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P170_S2	Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.
1430306_13_ITEM1A_P170_S3	The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.
1430306_13_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our current office space consists of approximately 2,355 square feet.
1430306_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease expires in September 2015.
1430306_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	The base rent is as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current business requirements.
1430306_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We maintain websites at www.tonixpharma.com and www.krele.com and the information contained on those websites is not deemed to be a part of this annual report.
1430306_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1430306_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is currently traded on the OTCQB under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	Prior to July 23, 2012, our common stock was quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	Prior to October 19, 2011, our common stock was quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol TAEI.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	Prior to February 2012, no public trades occurred in our common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P0_S4	For the periods indicated, the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported by NASDAQ.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	On March 8, 2013, the closing sale price of our common stock, as reported by Nasdaq, was $0.33 per share.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 8, 2013, there were 186 holders of record of our common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	Between October and November 2012, we issued promissory notes in the amount of $320,000 (the Notes ) in exchange for $320,000 borrowed from six affiliated investors.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	The Notes bear no interest and were payable on demand.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	On November 14, 2012, we sold to accredited investors for aggregate cash proceeds of $390,000, convertible debentures (the Debentures ) in the principal face amount of $390,000 and the exchange of the Notes for Debentures in the principal face amount of $320,000.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	The Debentures mature on the earlier of (i) November 14, 2013 or (ii) the date of closing of a private placement of equity, equity equivalent, convertible debt or debt financing in which we receive gross proceeds, in one or more transactions, of at least $100,000 (a Subsequent Financing ).
1430306_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	The Debentures bear interest at 8% per annum and are convertible at the holder s option into either (i) a Subsequent Financing at a price equal to a 25% discount to the price of securities sold in the Subsequent Financing or (ii) shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share equal to $1.00.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	In December 2012, the Company issued an aggregate of 8,904,167 units ( Units ) to certain accredited investors (the Purchasers ) for aggregate cash proceeds of $2,615,000, at a price per Unit of $0.40, and the exchange of $710,000 in previously issued convertible debentures (the Prior Debentures ) of the Company that were converted into Units at a price of $0.30 per Unit.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	Class A Warrants have an exercise price of $0.60 per share of Common Stock and will be exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	The Class A Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis under certain circumstances.
1430306_13_ITEM5_P7_S2	The Class B Warrants have an exercise price of $0.40 per share of Common Stock and will be exercisable for a period of one year from the date of issuance.
1430306_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may will, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and continue, or similar words.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company s services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel pharmaceutical products for challenging disorders of the CNS.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	We search for potential therapeutic solutions among known pharmaceutical agents that lack regulatory approval for the indications we seek, but may be approved for use in other indications.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	The ongoing evolution in the understanding of certain CNS disorders provides us with opportunities to develop such agents as proprietary products for new indications.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	We typically seek to create new dose and formulation options that are tailored to the therapeutic uses to which we apply these agents.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are currently devoting the majority of our efforts to the development of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 sublingual tablet, or TNX-102 SL.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	TNX-102 SL is a novel dose and formulation of CBP, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two widely prescribed muscle relaxant products, Flexeril and Amrix.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	TNX-102 SL is distinct from these products as it is being developed at a dose level significantly below the lowest marketed doses of Flexeril and Amrix.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	TNX-102 SL is also distinct from these products with regard to its route of administration, as it is designed to be placed under the tongue and disintegrated to provide sublingual absorption, whereas Flexeril and Amrix are designed to be swallowed.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	TNX-102 SL is also intended for chronic use, whereas Flexeril and Amrix are marketed for two to three weeks of use.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	We are currently developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM under an IND and under three CTAs filed in Canada.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	We are also developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD for which we held a pre-IND meeting in October 2012.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P3_S7	We expect that any applications we submit for FDA approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which we believe will allow for a shorter timeline of clinical development as compared to that needed to fulfill the requirements of Section 505(b)(1), under which NCEs are generally reviewed.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP for sublingual administration at bedtime.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We designed TNX-102 SL to enable the efficient delivery of CBP to the systemic circulation via sublingual transmucosal absorption and to avoid first-pass liver metabolism.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	We also designed TNX-102 SL to provide CBP at doses lower than those currently available.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	We have conducted several clinical and pre-clinical pharmacokinetic studies of TNX-102 SL which we believe support its development as a novel therapeutic product for FM and PTSD, and which demonstrate a number of potentially advantageous characteristics as compared to current CBP-containing products, none of which are approved for these indications.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	Based on our Phase 1 comparative study, we have observed that, as compared to oral CBP tablets, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following administration.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	TNX-102 SL was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in this study.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness on the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration, and other side-effects reported were similar to those associated with current CBP products.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-201 and TNX-301.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	TNX-201 is based on isometheptene mucate and is under development as a treatment for certain types of headaches.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	For competitive reasons, we do not disclose the identities of the active ingredients or targeted indications in our pipeline until a U.S. patent has been allowed or issued.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Consistent with our mission, these product candidates are or likely will be reformulations of active ingredients that have been used in humans in other products and that are designed for new CNS therapeutic indications.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	In other cases, the products will be formulated to match predicate products closely enough to be considered generic copies or similarly enough to other marketed products to rely (in part) on their regulatory review and approval, as well as available published data.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The predicate product may be approved by the FDA under an NDA or may have been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the National Academy of Sciences under the DESI program, in which case they would be considered by FDA to be unapproved products .
1430306_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	For DESI products, it is our intent to develop NDA versions to meet cGMP and the ICH requirements to seek approval under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Because of our size and being in the development stage, we do not currently devote a significant amount of time or resources towards our other pipeline candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We anticipate that sometime in 2013 we will begin developing formulations for TNX-201 and possibly TNX-301, but do not expect to start clinical trials until 2014 at the earliest.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	On October 7, 2011, we executed and consummated the Share Exchange Agreement with Tonix Sub.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Pursuant to the Share Exchange, each share of Tonix Sub s common stock was exchanged for 0.9 shares of our common stock, and each share of Tonix Sub s Series A and B preferred stock was exchanged for 4.8 shares of our common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Sub shareholders, including holders of 1,396,982 restricted shares, which were subject to accelerated vesting, received in exchange for all of their shares, an aggregate of 22,666,667 shares of our common stock and our existing stockholders retained 4,000,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The 22,666,667 shares issued to the Tonix Sub shareholders constituted approximately 85% of our 26,666,667 shares of common stock issued and outstanding after the Share Exchange.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	For accounting purposes, the acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of Tonix Sub, accompanied by the issuance of our common stock for the outstanding common stock of Toxic Sub, which was recorded at a nominal value.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	The historical financial statements are those of Tonix Sub.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S7	The accompanying financial statements give retroactive effect to the recapitalization as if it had occurred on June 7, 2007 (inception date).
1430306_13_ITEM7_P11_S8	Also, professional services expenses were allocated to research and development and general and administrative expenses in the 2010 and cumulative from inception through December 31, 2011 statement of operations to be consistent with the current period s presentation.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing our lead product, TNX-102 SL, but we also expend some effort on our earlier pipeline programs.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing work and the cost of drug ingredients used in such work, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy of our drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	We plan to start the next phase of clinical development for TNX-102 SL over the next six months, subject to raising necessary funds.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Clinical trials can be very expensive.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	If these and additional necessary clinical trials are successful, we plan to prepare and submit applications to the FDA for marketing approval for our drug candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	As a result of these and other factors, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next 12 to 24 months.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	We expect that a larger percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected patient recruitment, or government delays.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold .
1430306_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	We had no revenues or cost of goods sold during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 were $2,583,308, an increase of $1,425,141, or 123%, from $1,158,167 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	This increase is primarily due to increased development work related to TNX-102 SL, including formulation development, manufacturing, human and animal pharmacokinetic studies, and market research.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	In 2012, we incurred $552,953, $836,278 and $468,509 in manufacturing cost, clinical activities and cost, non-clinical activities cost, respectively, as compared to $0, $318,616 and $342,398 in 2011, respectively.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 were $4,078,102, an increase of $1,857,741, or 84%, from $2,220,361 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	This increase is primarily due to payroll related expenses and professional services.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Payroll related expenses increased to $1,820,877 in the current year from $731,285 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $1,089,592, or 149%.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	We incurred $865,157 in stock based compensation in connection with the vesting of stock options issued to board members, officers and employees in 2012 as compared to $159,596 in stock based compensation in 2011 relating to the acceleration of vesting in conjunction with our reverse merger in 2011 of restricted stock previously issued to our employees.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	The increase in cash payroll related costs of $384,032 was a result of the hiring of new employees, cash bonuses to employees, and severance payments to a former employee.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Professional services for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $1,444,455, an increase of $322,908, or 29%, over the $1,121,547 recognized for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Of professional services, legal fees totaled $465,523 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $92,448, or 25%, from $373,075 incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Consulting fees totaled $734,520 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $435,376 or 146%, from $299,144 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	The increase was primarily a result of $451,619 in public and investor relations costs in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $100,378 in 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	Accounting fees incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to $244,164, an increase of $1,161, or 0%, from $243,003 incurred in fiscal 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 were $108,248, an increase of $38,980, or 56%, from $69,268 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to medical and life sciences conferences, which accounted for the primary increase from 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Rent for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $116,732, a decrease of $11,496, or 9%, from $128,228 incurred in fiscal 2011, due primarily to the opening of new office space in New York in late 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	Market research and analysis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 was $229,546, an increase of $169,757 or 284% from $59,789 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	We continue to research and analyze the potential market for our products.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Depreciation expense in fiscal 2012 totaled $14,329, an increase of $5,029, or 54%, over the expense of $9,300 incurred in fiscal 2011, as a result of the purchase of new office computers.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Change in fair value of warrant liability .
1430306_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	In connection with our January and March 2012 financing, we issued warrants that contained certain reset provisions.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	As such, we were required to record the fair value as a liability and mark to market each reporting period.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	In June 2012, upon the effectiveness of our registration statement, these reset provisions expired.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Therefore we adjusted the fair value of the warrants from their initial issuance in January and March 2012, charged operations for the increase in fair value of $1,177,026 and reclassified the fair value of warrants to equity.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Interest expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $1,613,039, an increase of $1,521,454, or 1,661%, from $91,585 incurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, our interest costs were comprised primarily of a beneficial conversion feature related to our issuance of convertible debentures in December 2012 charged to interest of $710,000, $196,166 of deferred financing costs related to the issuance of our secured convertible debentures in October 2011 and December 2012, allocated offering costs of $270,743 charged to interest as part of a financing, and the fair value of $426,152, net with prior period accrual, of common stock and warrants issued to convertible debentures holders in connection with the conversion to a financing.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	In addition, we incurred interest expense related to our convertible debentures.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	In 2011, our interest costs were comprised primarily of amortization of deferred financing costs in conjunction with the issuance of our secured convertible debentures in October 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	We incurred an aggregate of $249,543 in deferred financing costs, of which we amortized $53,377 as interest expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	In addition, we incurred interest expense related to $500,000 of notes payable and our secured convertible debentures.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	As a result of the foregoing, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $9,449,600, compared to a net loss of $3,470,113 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had working capital of $871,257, comprised primarily of cash of $1,785,390 and prepaid expenses and other assets of $224,659, which was offset by $825,837 of accounts payable and $309,800 of accrued expenses.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, we used $5,712,864 of cash in operating activities.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	Cash provided by financing activities totaled $7,492,894 from the sale of shares of capital stock and warrants of $6,932,894, issuance of notes payable of $710,000 net with repayments of our convertible debentures of $150,000.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	In the comparable 2011 period, $612,000 was raised through the sale of shares of capital stock, $1,501,000 through issuance of convertible debentures and $500,000 through the issuance of other notes payable.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	At December 31, 2012, we had cash of $1,785,390 compared to $41,123 at December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	Our cash is held in bank deposit accounts.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P30_S6	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had nil and $2,075,000 of secured convertible debentures outstanding, respectively.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $5,712,864 and $2,637,578, respectively, which represent cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Increase in cash outlays principally resulted from manufacturing, pre-clinical, and clinical cost and activities, regulatory cost, payroll and rent.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $35,763 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $302 in the year ended December 31, 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we purchased office furniture and computer equipment of $35,673 and $2,764, respectively.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	In their report dated March 8, 2013, our independent registered public accounting firm stated at December 31, 2012, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	In addition, we will require additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Further, we do not have any commercial products available for sale and have not generated revenues and there is no assurance that if approval of our products is received that we will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	In addition, there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S5	Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, obtaining loans from various financial institutions or being awarded grants from government agencies, where possible.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P33_S6	Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to additional clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	We believe our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for the next six months.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	We anticipate we will need approximately $2,000,000 in addition to our current cash to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for the next 12 months.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	We will have to raise additional funds to continue our operations and, while we have been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary additional funds to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We presently do not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Due to our history and historical operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	We will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and fund research and development activities.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P36_S5	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Between January and March, 2012, we consummated a private placement financing transaction (the March 2012 Financing ) pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 264.7106 units (the March 2012 Units ) to certain investors for aggregate cash proceeds of $4,692,765 and the exchange of $1,925,000 in previously issued debentures that were converted into March 2012 Units.

1430306_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	On November 14, 2012, we sold to accredited investors for aggregate cash proceeds of $390,000, convertible debentures (the Debentures ) in the principal face amount of $390,000, and we exchanged the Notes for Debentures in the principal face amount of $320,000.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Debentures mature on the earlier of (i) November 14, 2013 or (ii) the date of closing of a private placement of equity, equity equivalent, convertible debt or debt financing in which we receive gross proceeds, in one or more transactions, of at least $100,000 (a Subsequent Financing ).

1430306_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	We have entered into various transactions with several companies under their control, including L L, Plumbline, Targent Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Targent, and Lederman Co.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	In 2010, we entered into a two-year consulting agreement with Lederman Co for clinical development, strategic, management and operational consulting services.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	Lederman Co received $250,000 per annum for its services, until August 1, 2011, when it received $127,000 per annum until such time as we closed on the 2012 Financing.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	We first closed on the 2012 Financing in January 2012, and effective February 1, 2012, Lederman Co receives $250,000 per annum for its services.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P48_S5	The consulting agreement renews automatically for subsequent terms of one year at $250,000 per annum.

1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	In February 2012, we approved the 2012 Incentive Stock Options Plan ( 2012 Plan ).
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock to officers, directors, employees and consultants.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Under the terms of the 2012 Plan, we may issue Incentive Stock Options, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and nonstatutory options.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Board of Directors determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the options granted under the 2012 Plan.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option must be at least 100% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant (or 110% for any stockholder that owns 10% or more of our common stock).
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	The fair market value of the common stock determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in a good faith.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the 2012 Plan should not be more than five years and expiration period not more than ten years.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S7	We reserved 4,000,000 shares of our common stock for future issuance under the terms of the 2012 Plan.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P50_S8	In May 2012, we issued options to purchase 3,500,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2012 Plan, with such options vesting 1/3 rd on May 9, 2013 and 1/36 th on the 9 th of each month thereafter for 24 months, having an exercise price of $1.50 and expiring 10 years from date of issuance.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	In September 2010, we entered into a five-year lease for office space in New York City, with monthly payments escalating from approximately $10,000 in the first year to approximately $11,000 in the fifth year.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Company received a rent credit of $9,420 in each of the months of November 2010, December 2010 and January 2011.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	We issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $60,000 for the benefit of the landlord, which is collateralized by a money market account.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our future minimum lease payments under the operating lease are as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Tonix outsources its research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1430306_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (a development stage company) (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years then ended and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2012 and the consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficiency) equity for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2012 and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2007.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2012 and consolidated changes in stockholders' (deficiency) equity for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2012 and for the period from June 7, 2007 (inception) through December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P4_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations and requires additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P4_S2	These events and conditions, among others referred to in Note 2, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P4_S3	Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P4_S4	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. through its wholly owned subsidiary Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is attempting to develop safer and more effective versions of widely prescribed central nervous system ( CNS ) drugs.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	While some new applications can use the commercially available form of the drug, in other cases reformulating the active ingredient improves its safety or effectiveness in treating the CNS condition.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	When formal development programs have proven successful in clinical tests, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. intends to seek marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ).
1430306_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	On August 16, 2010, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. formed Krele LLC ( Krele ) in the state of Delaware.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	Krele is a limited liability corporation whose sole member is Tonix Pharmaceuticals Inc.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P6_S2	Krele was established to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate new drug application products or versions of drug efficacy study implementation products.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P6_S3	The Company expects that its relationship to Krele will be similar to that of several other pharmaceutical companies and their subsidiaries that market generic versions of the parent's branded products at different periods in their product life-cycle.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	On October 7, 2011, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Krele Pharmaceuticals, Inc. incorporated on June 7, 2007 in the State of Delaware) and a publicly traded non-operating shell company Tamandare Explorations Inc. ( Tamandare ), incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, along with certain other parties executed and consummated a share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange ).
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Pursuant to the Share Exchange, each share of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Inc. s common stock was exchanged for 0.9 shares of Tamandare s common stock and each share of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s Series A and B preferred stock was exchanged for 4.8 shares of Tamandare s common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. shareholders, including holders of restricted shares, which were subject to accelerated vesting, received in exchange for all of their shares, an aggregate of 22,666,667 shares of Tamandare s common stock and Tamandare s existing stockholders retained 4,000,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S3	The 22,666,667 shares issued to the Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. shareholders constituted approximately 85% of Tamandare s 26,666,667 issued and outstanding shares of common stock after the Share Exchange.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S4	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. became Tamandare s wholly-owned subsidiary and in October 2011 Tamandare was renamed Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S5	As the owners and management of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. obtained voting and operating control of Tamandare after the Share Exchange and Tamandare was non-operating, had no assets or liabilities and did not meet the definition of a business, the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., accompanied by the issuance of its common stock for outstanding common stock of Tamandare, which was recorded at a nominal value.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P7_S6	The accompanying financial statements and related notes give retroactive effect to the recapitalization as if it had occurred on June 7, 2007 (inception date) and accordingly all share and per share amounts have been adjusted.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Krele LLC (hereafter referred to as the Company or Tonix ).
1430306_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	As the Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business, and while planned principal operations have commenced, there has been no revenue generated from sales, license fees or royalties, the Company is considered a development stage enterprise.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	Accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance related to a development stage enterprise.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	Financial position, results of operations and cash flows of a development stage enterprise are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that apply to established operating enterprises.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	As a development stage enterprise, the Company's primary efforts are devoted to conducting research and development for the treatment of CNS diseases.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	In addition, although the Company has approximately $900,000 of working capital at December 31, 2012, the Company will require additional financing to fund future operations as it is expected that cash to be used in operations will increase significantly over the next several years.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S3	The Company intends to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of its current product candidates through equity or debt financing; however the Company does not have any commitments or definitive or binding arrangements for such funds.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S4	There can be no assurance that such funds, if available at all, can be obtained on terms reasonable to the Company.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S5	If the Company is unsuccessful in raising additional capital it will need to reduce costs and operations substantially.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S6	Further, the Company does not have any commercial products available for sale and has not generated revenues and there is no assurance that if approval of their products is received that the Company will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P10_S7	In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The above factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	Significant estimates include assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation and the fair value of other equity instruments.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company outsources its research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed in 2007 and 2010 as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Furniture and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life, which is three years for computer assets and five years for furniture and all other equipment.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors, including grants of restricted stock and stock options, are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation or other expense over the relevant service period.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Stock-based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P17_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non forfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss, by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock, adjusted to give effect to the exchange ratio in the Share Exchange in October 2011, which was accounted for as a recapitalization of the Company (see Note 1).

1430306_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:
1430306_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	(1) The Company has incurred research and development ( R D ) expenses, a portion of which may qualify for tax credits.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company has not conducted an R D credit study to quantify the amount of credits and has not claimed an R D credit on its federal tax returns filed except for $6,188 in 2007.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	The Company may conduct the study in future years and may establish the R D credit carryforward for prior years.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	In such event, the net operating loss carryforward will be correspondingly reduced by the amount of the credit.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Based on the Company's historical losses and its expectation of continuation of losses for the foreseeable future, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly, has provided a valuation allowance.

1430306_13_ITEM8_P82_S4	Accordingly, the extent to which such carryforwards can be used to offset future taxable income may be limited.
1430306_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company's federal and state tax returns remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities for the tax years 2009 and after.

1430306_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	In connection with founding Tonix Sub, L L and Plumbline entered into an intellectual property transfer and assignment agreement with Tonix Sub for the purpose of assigning patents and transferring intellectual property and know-how in exchange for shares of common stock of Tonix Sub.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	As a result of economic conditions related to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, Tonix Sub was not successful in raising money to fund its programs until 2009.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	As a result, Tonix Sub was unable to advance the development programs and had little activity except for prosecuting and maintaining patents and maintaining contracts.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation to analyze the sleep data from a Phase 2a trial of nighttime VLD CBP in fibromyalgia, or FM ( the Moldofsky Study ).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Moldofsky Study was conducted in Canada by the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation, and Tonix Sub obtained the data from this study from L L.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	In addition, in 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with Caliper Life Sciences Inc., or Caliper, to analyze the interactions of CBP with certain receptors.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	In June 2010, Tonix Sub entered into consulting agreements with L L and Lederman Co., LLC, or Lederman Co, and also acquired certain rights to develop isometheptene mucate as a treatment for certain types of headaches from Lederman Co, which we are developing as TNX-201.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P15_S4	Dr. Lederman is managing partner of Lederman Co. Between June 2010 and October 2011, Tonix Sub was active in recruiting new officers and directors and initiating preclinical and clinical development of novel CBP formulations.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	In July 2010, Tonix Sub changed its name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	In August 2010, we formed Krele to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate New Drug Application, or NDA, products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We anticipate that when our branded products lose patent protection, Krele may market authorized generic versions of them.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Krele also may develop or acquire generic products approved under ANDAs and we may market branded versions (branded generics) of such products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Krele has been issued a state license in New York.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	On April 23, 2013, we formed Tonix Canada.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Tonix Canada is intended to perform research and development efforts in Canada.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	As a Canadian entity, we expect Tonix Canada will be entitled to receive certain reimbursable tax credits for research expenditures in Canada.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	On October 24, 2013, Tonix Sub formed Tonix Barbados.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	On December 31, 2013, Tonix Barbados entered into a license agreement and a cost-sharing agreement with Tonix Sub, pursuant to which Tonix Barbados acquired the rights to develop and commercialize TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 for non-US markets in exchange for (1) cost sharing of research and development costs going forward and (2) royalties of 8% and 6% on net sales of TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	We are a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel pharmaceutical products for challenging problems.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our lead drug development programs are directed toward CNS conditions that manifest with pain that originates in the brain, or central pain.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Central pain results from abnormal sensory processing in the CNS, rather than from dysfunction in peripheral tissues where pain is perceived.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our most advanced development program is for the management of fibromyalgia, or FM, a central pain syndrome.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	We also have development programs for the management of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, in which central pain is a component, and for the relief of episodic tension-type headache, or ETTH.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	We also have a pipeline of additional product candidates that we plan to develop for other CNS indications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our lead product candidate, TNX-102 sublingual tablet, or TNX-102 SL, is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP for sublingual administration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are developing TNX-102 SL as a bedtime therapy for the management of FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	CBP is the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two widely prescribed products, and we are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for indications distinct from those for which current CBP products are approved.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	We believe that TNX-102 SL is an optimized CBP product for the treatment of FM and PTSD, and is distinct from current CBP products in three ways: (1) it is being developed at a dose level significantly below the lowest marketed doses of current CBP products; (2) it is placed under the tongue, to disintegrate, dissolve and provide sublingual absorption, whereas current CBP products are swallowed and provide absorption in the small intestine; and (3) it is being developed for chronic use, whereas current CBP products are marketed for two to three weeks of use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We expect that any applications we submit to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which we believe will allow for a shorter timeline of clinical and non-clinical development as compared to that needed to fulfill the requirements of Section 505(b)(1), under which new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been marketed in the United States, are generally developed to meet the FDA s requirements for new drug approvals.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have conducted several clinical and non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies of TNX-102 sublingual formulations, which we believe support the development of TNX-102 SL as a novel therapeutic product for FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Results from these studies demonstrate a number of potentially advantageous characteristics as compared to current CBP-containing products (Flexeril and Amrix ), which are not approved for these indications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	For example, our Phase 1 comparative studies showed that TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following administration relative to oral CBP tablets.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	TNX-102 SL was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in these studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness on the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration, and other side-effects reported were similar to those associated with current CBP products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM under a U.S. Investigational New Drug application, or IND, and we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	TNX-102 SL is currently in a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for the improvement of pain in subjects with FM, from which we expect to report initial results in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Our therapeutic strategy is supported by results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study of low dose TNX-102 immediate release capsules, or TNX-102 capsules, which we have also referred to as VLD CBP, taken between dinner and bedtime in 36 subjects with FM, which demonstrated a significant decrease in pain and other symptoms after eight weeks of treatment.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	This study also demonstrated that TNX-102 capsules led to a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality, which we believe relates to the mechanism by which CBP leads to improvement of FM symptoms.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We have completed four Phase 1 studies under Canadian Clinical Trial Applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our Phase 1 studies demonstrated TNX-102 SL to exhibit a pharmacokinetic profile that we believe supports chronic bedtime administration for the treatment of FM, and is distinct from those of currently-available CBP products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	According to the National Institutes of Health, there are approximately five million people suffering from FM in the U.S.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	The peak incidence of FM occurs at 20 50 years of age, and 80-90% of diagnosed patients are female.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	FM may have a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in careers or education.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Although the disordered brain processes that underlie FM are yet to be fully understood, the mechanisms of drugs that treat central pain are believed to target certain aspects of nerve signaling.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	Three drugs, Lyrica (pregabalin), Cymbalta (duloxetine), and Savella (milnacipran), are approved by the FDA for the management of FM and are believed to act upon molecular pathways involved in central pain.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	Lyrica is believed to affect nerve signaling by blocking calcium channels on nerve cells, and is considered a nerve membrane stabilizer.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Cymbalta and Savella are believed to directly inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine by nerves, and are referred to as Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, or SNRIs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	CBP, the active ingredient of TNX-102 SL, is a selective antagonist of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and we refer to it as a Serotonin and Norepinephrine receptor Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor, or SNARI.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	As many products used for the treatment of FM are approved and marketed for other conditions, sales of these products related specifically to FM can only be estimated.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Based on information obtained from publicly available sources, we believe U.S. sales of prescription drugs specifically for the treatment of FM totaled approximately $1.5 billion in 2012, and we believe this segment had grown at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 14% between 2007 and 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Based on information obtained from publicly available sources, we believe 2012 sales of Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella in FM were approximately $600 million, $475 million, and $100 million, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Despite the availability and use of a variety of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions, FM remains a significant unmet medical need.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the approved medications, or discontinue therapy due to poor tolerability.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Prescription pain and sleep medications are frequently taken off-label for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic effect.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	An important goal of FM treatment is to reduce the dependence on opiate analgesic as well as on benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medications by FM patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Since CBP has no recognized addictive potential, we believe that TNX-102 SL, if approved, could reduce the exposure of FM patients to medications that have not been shown to be effective in treating FM and are associated with significant safety risks.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	At our End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA, we discussed the design of our clinical program, including the acceptability of the pivotal study design and the proposed registration plan, to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled safety and efficacy studies and the establishment of long-term safety for chronic use would support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	We are currently conducting the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 BEdtime Sublingual TNX-102 SL as Fibromyalgia Intervention Therapy (BESTFIT) trial, which we initiated in September 2013 under the IND.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	In this multicenter clinical trial, subjects with FM are treated with either TNX-102 2.8 mg sublingual tablets (SL) or a placebo at bedtime daily for 12 weeks.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	We expect to enroll approximately 200 patients into this study.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The primary efficacy endpoint is change in pain from baseline to week 12.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	If successful, this trial will serve as the first of two pivotal studies to support an NDA for TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	We have engaged Premier Research International, LLC, a contract research organization, or CRO, to provide clinical and data management services for this Phase 2b/3 trial.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	We expect to report initial efficacy results from the BESTFIT trial in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The primary efficacy measure in this study will be the change in pain severity at week 12 with TNX-102 SL as compared to placebo, as assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale, or NRS.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	This endpoint is similar to that utilized in clinical trials of drug products currently approved for use in FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	We are also collecting information on other outcome measures, including NRS scores at other time points, the revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and the Patient Global Impression of Change.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	In December 2013, we announced the initiation of F203, a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL to be taken daily at bedtime, into which patients who have completed the BESTFIT study may enroll.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	The goal is to obtain sufficient 6 and 12 month exposure data in FM patients to meet the NDA submission requirement.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	We are also advancing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012, and we plan to file an IND to pursue this indication in the second quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	We plan to begin a Proof-of-Concept (POC) trial of TNX-102 SL in subjects with military-related PTSD in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	Based on the results of the POC trial, we will meet with the FDA to finalize the design of the registration studies to support the PTSD NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	We believe the approval will be based upon positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (6 and 12 month) safety exposure data.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P41_S5	We expect the long-term safety exposure data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM can be used to support the PTSD indication.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	TNX-201 is a single isomer of isometheptene mucate (IMH) and is under development as a treatment for ETTH, an indication believed to affect approximately 20% of the global adult population.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Although currently not approved for any indication, IMH has an extensive history of use as a prescription pharmaceutical in the U.S. as a mixture of two mirror-image isomers, also known as a racemic mixture.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Racemic IMH has been marketed in combination products for the relief of tension and vascular headaches (examples include Midrin and MigraTen ).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	The selection of a single isomer of IMH for development may confer an improved clinical profile as compared to the racemic mixture, consistent with the FDA Stereoisomeric Drugs Development Policy, and is supported by our pharmacology data.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in January 2014 to discuss the regulatory pathway for the development of TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	The initial IND for TNX-201 will not require any additional nonclinical data to support a first-in-man study, and we plan to conduct a Phase I comparative pharmacokinetic and safety study in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	Although the development of TNX-201 will be based on the available information on racemic IMH, the NDA approval will be required to conform with the 505(b)(1) NDA requirement.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	In addition to TNX-102 SL, we have developed other innovative formulations of CBP, including TNX-102 promicellar gelatin capsule, or TNX-102 gelcap.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	We have developed TNX-102 gelcap under an agreement with Lipocine, Inc., or Lipocine, a contract formulation developer and small-scale manufacturer.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	We met with the FDA to discuss the TNX-102 gelcap development program in August 2011 and have generated clinical data that support the further development of this candidate.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	However, we currently do not plan to advance TNX-102 gelcap, and in March 2014, we notified Lipocine of our decision to not exercise our option to license Lipocine s technology, although we own all the work product, information and data from the studies conducted.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	TNX-301 is a fixed dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	We intend to develop TNX-301 under the 505(b)(2) provision as a treatment for alcohol abuse and dependence, and plan to begin formulation work on TNX-301 in 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	In addition, we recently acquired rights to intellectual property on the development of protective agents against radiation exposure and on the development of novel smallpox vaccines.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	The radio- and chemo-protective technology relates to proprietary forms of a small molecular pharmaceutical agent, which is believed to protect against ionizing radiation after oral administration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	The smallpox vaccine technology relates to proprietary forms of live vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, which is the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P45_S2	As we interact with the United States Department of Defense and related biodefense agencies regarding our development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD, we believe these technologies will expand our interaction and cooperation with such agencies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P45_S3	We plan to perform non-clinical research and development on these programs in 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	For competitive reasons, we typically do not disclose the identities of the active ingredients or targeted indications in our pipeline until a U.S. patent has been allowed or issued.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates to treat CNS conditions, including FM, PTSD and ETTH.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	The principal components of our strategy to achieve this objective are to:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	establish and maintain a sales and marketing infrastructure, such that we will be able to effectively commercialize our products once approved.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Pursue development and regulatory approval pathways .
1430306_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	We are developing TNX-102 SL under the Section 505(b)(2) FDA pathway.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	This pathway can reduce the time and expense required for our development programs by allowing our use of previously-generated safety and efficacy information regarding the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our lead product candidates to support the filing and approval of our NDA application.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our use of this information may help reduce the size and scope of our preclinical and clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We expect to develop TNX-201 under Section 505(b)(1), the pathway followed for an NCE or marketed drug without an approved NDA in the United States.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	For TNX-201, a single isomer of a marketed racemic drug, we are able to leverage the existing racemic IMH human experience to design an efficient development program.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	While we expect to pursue the development of TNX-301 under Section 505(b)(2), we have not yet discussed this candidate with the FDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	In general, our ability to pursue the 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) regulatory pathways will depend, at least in part, on the data available for reference of the particular candidate to support product registration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	The use of a drug product for the treatment of a condition other than one of its approved label indications is called off-label use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	The development of an existing FDA-approved drug for the treatment of a condition other than one of its approved label indications is considered a new use .
1430306_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	For companies involved in the ethical development and marketing of prescription drugs in the US, FDA approval of a new use or new label indication is the only legal basis of marketing claims for that use or indication.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	Off-label use is not recognized by the FDA or FDA-regulated companies as a new use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Adopt a multi-pronged patent strategy .
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	We are pursuing a multi-pronged patent strategy by seeking intellectual property protection on several aspects of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	Aspects we seek to protect include, among others, methods of use for certain known active pharmaceutical ingredients, formulation technologies incorporated into our products, performance characteristics of our products in the human body and the composition-of-matter of our products .
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	With respect to methods of use patents, we believe the therapeutic uses we target are new uses for these active ingredients and we have been issued patents directed to certain aspects of our new uses.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	For example, the invention of bedtime TNX-102 as a treatment for FM was novel and unexpected when our patents were filed in 2000.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S4	We are seeking additional patents to cover other new uses.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S5	For example, we filed a patent application seeking to protect the use of CBP in PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S6	With respect to formulation patents, we believe our products will be protected by patents that describe inventions of technology for making new formulations, which may include novel routes of delivery for the active ingredients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S7	With respect to patents related to the performance characteristics of our products in the human body, we believe our products will be protected by patents that describe novel pharmacokinetic properties of the active ingredient, as well as of its active metabolites, at certain times after administration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S8	For example, we filed a patent application seeking to protect novel pharmacokinetic properties of CBP as enabled by TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P53_S9	In the case of TNX-201, for which the active ingredient is a single isomer of racemic isometheptene, we have filed a patent application seeking to protect the composition-of-matter of oral dosage forms that contain only the single isomer and not the racemic mixture.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Provide clear value propositions to third-party payors to merit reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	We are designing our clinical development programs to demonstrate compelling competitive advantages to patients and prescribers and also to demonstrate value propositions to third-party payors.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	We believe TNX-102 SL might help in the management of FM by reducing pain and other symptoms, such as fatigue.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	In addition, primarily as a result of its lower dosage, we believe that bedtime treatment with TNX-102 SL will have fewer day time side-effects than off-label bedtime treatment with immediate-release CBP products approved for the treatment of muscle spasm, or CBP IR.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	For FM, we believe an FDA-approved product would capture some of the off-label use of CBP IR.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S5	Because FDA approvals are based on objective data, we believe that third-party payors will provide reimbursement for an FDA approved product, even at a premium price relative to other drugs that are used off-label, such as CBP IR, tizanidine, baclofen, carisoprodol or metaxalone.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S6	For example, third-party payors reimburse the use of Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella for FM despite the availability of off-label generic versions of drugs with similar mechanisms of action, for example, Neurontin (gabapentin) and generic anti-depressants, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P54_S7	Cymbalta lost its U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Establish and maintain an effective sales and marketing infrastructure.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We believe TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 can be marketed to physicians in the United States by means of a sales force built by or engaged by us.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Many large and small pharmaceutical companies engage contract sales organizations, or CSOs, to launch products and contracts with such organizations can be structured as a rent-to-buy model.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	The flexibility and scalability of such organizations has made it possible for many emerging companies to decide to market their own products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	Therefore, we plan to work with CSOs to develop the capabilities of building a sales force, initially through contracting, and we may eventually internalize the sales and marketing capabilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	Another option for certain of our drug development candidates, including TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, would be to partner with companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	If we determine that such a strategy would be more favorable than developing our own sales capabilities, we would seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our lead product candidate is TNX-102 SL, which we are developing for the treatment of FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	TNX-102 SL consists of CBP in a mixture of inactive ingredients that are called excipients , which we believe will improve the absorption rate of CBP in ways that will optimize the product for bedtime treatment.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	The excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved by the FDA for pharmaceutical uses.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	CBP was first synthesized in 1961 by Merck, and the 10 mg Flexeril immediate-release, or IR, dose form was FDA approved in 1977 for the relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Although a number of clinical studies have addressed the potential use and benefit of CBP in treating symptoms of FM, to our knowledge these studies have not motivated a sponsor to pursue FDA approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Based on CBP s safety and efficacy for treating muscle spasm, in the 1990s, Merck conducted studies to support an application to market a 5 mg Flexeril tablet for the over-the-counter, or OTC, market, whereby patients can purchase medicine without a physician s prescription.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Although Merck s studies re-affirmed the safety and demonstrated efficacy of 5 mg Flexeril in several large trials, the OTC division of the FDA rejected the application for use without a prescription, apparently, we believe, because muscle spasm was deemed a condition that required a physician to diagnose and supervise treatment.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Merck divested the Flexeril franchise to Alza Pharmaceuticals, or Alza, which was subsequently acquired by Johnson and Johnson and Flexeril is part of its McNeil Consumer Healthcare division, or McNeil.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Based largely on the Merck studies, McNeil won approval of Flexeril 5 mg tablets as a prescription medicine to treat muscle spasm.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	McNeil promoted Flexeril 5 mg tablets for the three year period of market exclusivity based on The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, generally referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Following this exclusivity period, several generics entered the market and took market share from Flexeril.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	McNeil has discontinued the manufacture of Flexeril.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Despite the approved uses of CBP in treating muscle spasm, we believe current marketed formulations of CBP are limited for treating FM by slow and unpredictable absorption.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	Following the ingestion of CBP IR, it takes more than one hour for clinically-meaningful blood levels to be achieved.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	As described in the Flexeril package insert, the amount of CBP absorbed into the bloodstream varies between 33 55% of the dose ingested.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	The variability in absorption may be due to several factors, including effects of the stomach pH (acidity or base) on the dissolution of the tablets, as well as the context of either an empty stomach or a recent meal.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	Food in the stomach and small intestine from a recent meal contributes to variability in absorbing other drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	The uncertainties in absorption rates make it challenging for a physician contemplating a bedtime treatment for FM to ensure the intended therapeutic effect is achieved without risking side effects like next-day drowsiness, which could result if the patient has too much CBP remaining in the bloodstream the next day.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	If a product could provide rapid and consistent absorption of CBP, patients would be more likely to receive a drug exposure profile that is aligned with the intended period of exposure and less likely to receive too little drug to receive a therapeutic effect.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Conversely, patients would be less likely to receive too much drug, which might lead to potential side effects, including next-day drowsiness.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	An optimal bedtime CBP product could have faster absorption, lower blood levels in the morning and more predictable effects than the IR tablet format.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	We have tested a number of technologies to optimize the properties of CBP as a bedtime therapy for FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our lead product, TNX-102 SL is a novel sublingual tablet form of CBP that we have tested in pre-clinical and clinical studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	We entered TNX-102 SL into a potential pivotal clinical trial in FM in September 2013, and we plan to begin a POC trial in PTSD in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	We believe the unique properties of TNX-102 SL, as demonstrated by the results of our studies, support its development in both FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	TNX-102 SL, our lead product candidate, is a rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP that is designed to be placed under the tongue at bedtime.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	The development of TNX-102 SL in FM is supported by the results of the Moldofsky Study, which evaluated oral administration of TNX-102 capsules in the evening, as well as by preclinical and comparative clinical pharmacokinetic studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	In the Moldofsky Study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2a trial, it was demonstrated that TNX-102 capsules, swallowed between dinner and bedtime, resulted in significant decreases in next-day pain and other core FM symptoms after eight weeks of treatment, as well as in a significant improvement in sleep quality.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	We believe that CBP exerts its benefit in FM via its ability to improve the restorative quality of sleep, which has been shown to be frequently impaired in patients with FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	Current CBP products are believed to be widely used off-label by FM patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	FM is diagnosed by groups of symptoms that have been defined by committees of the American College of Rheumatology, or ACR, and a committee of experts from the organization Outcome Measures in Rheumatology.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	In 2007, Pfizer s Lyrica became the first medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	In 2008, Eli Lilly s Cymbalta became the second medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P69_S3	In 2009, Savella was the third medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Savella is marketed by Forest Laboratories.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our motivation to focus our efforts on developing TNX-102 SL for FM stems from the results of the Moldofsky Study, the related rights to which we acquired from L L. Specifically, this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating eight week trial conducted at two study centers.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	The study randomized 36 subjects, all of whom met ACR criteria for FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Patients received TNX-102 capsules or placebo to ingest after dinner and before bedtime.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	Each TNX-102 capsule contained 1 mg of CBP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	Initially, patients took one capsule each evening, but over the course of the study, they were allowed to increase the number of capsules taken, up to four per evening.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	At week eight, patients treated with TNX-102 capsules demonstrated significant improvements in pain, fatigue and tenderness relative to baseline, whereas placebo-treated patients did not improve.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	Although this study excluded patients who met formal criteria for major depressive disorder or any anxiety disorder, there is a high degree of co-existing symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	Relative to baseline, treatment with TNX-102 capsules also resulted in a significant reduction in total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score, which measures symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the HAD depression subscore which measures depressive symptoms.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Figure 1: Results of a Phase 2a Study of TNX-102 capsules in FM patients as administered between dinner and bedtime.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	As illustrated in Figure 1, this study showed that treatment with TNX-102 capsules as compared to treatment with placebo:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	improved mood, by demonstrating a significant decrease in mean HAD depression subscore (p 0.05).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	This study also showed that TNX-102 capsules taken between dinner and bedtime resulted in a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	We believe that CBP exerts its benefit in FM via its ability to improve the restorative quality of sleep, which has been shown to be frequently impaired in patients with FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	In this study, TNX-102 capsules were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	This research was published in the Journal of Rheumatology , in an article entitled Effects of Bedtime Very Low Dose (VLD) Cyclobenzaprine (CBP) on Symptoms and Sleep Physiology in Patients with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FM): A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study.

1430306_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	We have conducted preclinical and clinical studies of our sublingual formulations of CBP, which have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of these formulations as well as their comparative bioavailability to oral CBP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Our preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that our sublingual formulations provide faster delivery and more efficient systemic absorption of CBP as compared to current oral forms of the drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	In three Phase I comparative pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies, TNX-102 SL was generally well tolerated.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	There were no unexpected adverse events, with the exception of a mild, temporary numbness at the tongue experienced by less than one-third of the subjects that received TNX-102 SL tablets.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	We are currently conducting a Phase 2b/3 study of TNX-102 SL in FM called the BESTFIT trial.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, FM patients will be administered either TNX-102 SL or placebo at bedtime nightly for 12 weeks.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	We expect that our BESTFIT trial, if successful and accepted by the FDA, will be one of the two pivotal studies required to support the NDA approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P83_S3	The study began in September 2013 and we expect to announce initial results in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	In December 2013, we announced the initiation of F203, a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL to be taken daily at bedtime, into which patients who have completed the BESTFIT study may enroll.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	The goal is to obtain sufficient 6 and 12 month safety exposure data in FM patients to meet the NDA submission requirement.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	If our Phase 2b/3 BESTFIT study of TNX-102 SL in FM is successful, then we expect to conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in support of product registration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	It is likely that the primary efficacy measure in this study will be the change in pain severity with TNX-102 SL as compared to a placebo at week 12, as assessed by the NRS, similar to the primary efficacy measure of BESTFIT.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	Secondary outcome measures will be determined based on the results from the BESTFIT study.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P85_S3	These will be carefully selected to support competitive labeling for TNX-102 SL for FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Since CBP will be used chronically in TNX-102 SL, we plan to study TNX-102 SL in comparison to CBP IR in a multiple-day dosing (once daily) study.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	The results of this study will provide information regarding blood levels of CBP resulting from use of the marketed IR tablet and our sublingual TNX-102 SL tablet when taken in a multiple day regimen.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	We expect the data from this study to serve as a bridge , in that they will allow us to use the CBP IR tablet as the reference product in our submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	We plan to conduct a small study designed to evaluate next morning drowsiness and other cognitive measures following the bedtime use of TNX-102 SL and the bedtime use of CBP IR.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	The goal of this study is to determine the potential benefit of TNX-102 SL compared with CBP IR on next morning drowsiness and on other cognitive functions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	In addition to the clinical data necessary to support the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA filing for the fibromyalgia indication, the FDA also clarified the nonclinical studies required for the NDA filing since the information from the reference product is either unavailable for reference or failed to meet the current regulatory standard.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	In 2014, we will be selecting an FDA-certified Good Laboratory Practices laboratory to conduct a six month repeated-dose toxicology study in rats, a nine month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs and a peri- and post-natal Segment III study required for the NDA filing.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	We plan to submit these draft toxicology protocols for FDA review and seek agreement on the doses and facilities chosen for these studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P88_S3	These studies will be performed concurrently with the Phase 3 study and will be completed ahead of the NDA submission.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Based on the Flexeril labeling and post-marketing surveillance information, there is no evidence of abuse for CBP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	As a result, we will not have to assess the abuse potential of TNX-102 SL for the NDA submission.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	The TNX-102 SL drug product that has been manufactured for our BESTFIT study was manufactured in a small-scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	For the second pivotal study and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P90_S2	The product s comparability will be supported by the bioequivalence results from the bridging study, TNX-CY-F105.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	We have submitted a Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, which contains a partial waiver of the requirement to submit pediatric assessments per Section 505B(a)(4)(A)(i) of the FDCA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	Final PSP requirement will be determined at the time of NDA approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	Based our discussions with the FDA and the FDA formal meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or a cardiovascular safety study to support the NDA filing.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for FM, the FDA requests no risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	The FDA approvals of Lyrica, Cymbalta and Savella establish a regulatory approval standard for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	However, given the heterogeneity of patients with this disease, it may not prove to be the only pathway or approval requirement.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	We hope to register TNX-102 SL with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	This regulatory pathway may help to accelerate product development and reduce overall business risk.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	The 505(b)(2)-based product development plan for TNX-102 SL is designed to leverage the safety data that have been generated by other manufacturers for CBP-containing products and accepted by the FDA in support of their product registrations, in addition to the safety data we generate.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	TNX-102 SL contains significantly less active CBP than other marketed products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	We believe that the safety data package from these products and the CBP prescriptions utilization database analyzed by IMS Health Incorporated will provide adequate safety margin to support TNX-102 SL development.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	At our End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting we held with the FDA in February 2013, we discussed the nature and extent of the Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials we need to conduct to so as to receive regulatory acceptance of our proposed NDA plan for a differentiated product for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	If NDA approval of TNX-102 SL is granted, in addition to the three-year marketing exclusivity provided by law, we expect this product to be protected by patents that extend through at least 2021, during which time it should not be subject to generic substitution.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	We plan to continue to support the TNX-102 SL program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and in FM patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P96_S2	For example, we have recently filed patent applications on TNX-102 SL which, if issued, would be expected to provide protection from generic substitution until at least 2033.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	We are also developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD, a psychiatric disorder that begins in the aftermath of traumatic experiences.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012, at which our clinical program for PTSD was discussed.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	We plan to file an IND in the second quarter of 2014 to support the initiation of a POC efficacy study in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	A number of parallels have been noted between FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	In addition, symptom overlap may exist between patients diagnosed with FM or PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	Res. 2006, 61(5):663-9), 49% of PTSD patients met the ACR criteria for FM compared to 5% of major depression patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P98_S3	Arthritis Rheum. 2002, 32(1):38-50), 57% of the sample had symptoms associated with PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	A core feature of PTSD is sleep disturbance, including insomnia and nightmares.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	Sleep disturbances are believed to exacerbate daytime symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, poor concentration, and diminished interest in significant activities.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P99_S2	We believe the sleep disturbances of PTSD bear similarity to those associated with FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Paxil (paroxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline) are FDA approved for PTSD, but are not satisfactory treatments for many patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	Other drugs that show promise for the treatment of PTSD, but are not FDA approved, include antidepressants such as nefazodone, mirtazapine and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; certain atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone; and an adrenergic alpha-1 receptor blocker, prazosin.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P100_S2	Prazosin may decrease nightmares and insomnia and has been associated with improvements in daytime PTSD symptoms, depression, and quality of life.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	Our rationale for studying the effects of CBP in PTSD derives from the following:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	in receptor binding studies conducted by Caliper under our direction, CBP interacts with a receptor on brain cells called the serotonin type 2a receptor.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	Based on numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications, we have identified a number of compounds that bind this receptor that have been shown to have effects in treating PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	Therefore, it is our belief that CBP, because it binds to the serotonin type 2a receptor, will have a therapeutic effect in treating PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	As very little information was available on the biochemical effects of CBP and its primary metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine, or nCBP, in the central nervous system, we have engaged several CROs to better understand the interactions of these agents with certain receptors in the brain.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	CROs we have engaged in this effort include Caliper, Cerep, Millipore, and DiscoveRx.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	Results from a series of binding and functional studies show that both of these molecules are potent antagonists of the serotonin type 2a and the histamine H1 receptors, which known to have effects on sleep and sleep maintenance.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P104_S3	The results also show that CBP and nCBP antagonize the adrenergic alpha 1A and 1B receptors, which may have effects on autonomic dysfunction.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	Based on the recommendations and guidance received at our October 2012 pre-IND meeting with the FDA and in consultation with experts in this psychiatric disorder, we plan to file an IND application for TNX-102 SL in the PTSD indication in the second quarter of 2014, and to begin a POC trial in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P105_S1	We expect to be able to use TNX-102 SL tablets manufactured for the FM studies in this clinical trial.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	The IND to be filed in the second quarter of 2014 will have the information necessary to support a POC clinical study to ascertain the potential efficacy of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	We expect this will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study of bedtime TNX-102 SL in military-related PTSD subjects.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	We expect the dosing period to be six weeks, and the primary efficacy measure to be the change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale from baseline to week six.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P107_S0	If our POC trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is successful, we will meet with the FDA to finalize the design of the registration studies to support the PTSD NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P107_S1	We believe the approval will be comprised of positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (6 and 12 month) safety exposure data.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P107_S2	We expect the long-term safety exposure data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM can be used to support the PTSD indication.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P108_S0	The approvals by the FDA of Paxil (paroxetine) and Zoloft (sertraline) for treating PTSD established a regulatory approval pathway for symptom reduction in PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P108_S1	We believe our clinical development program of TNX-102 SL and the long term safety data generated from the TNX-102 SL FM NDA program will result in a differentiated product suitable for chronic use for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P108_S2	We believe that our planned clinical trials in PTSD, if successful, will provide sufficient evidence of clinical efficacy and safety to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P109_S0	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA on TNX-102 SL in PTSD in October 2012, and we expect to file an IND in the second quarter of 2014 and to initiate a POC study in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P109_S1	We plan to meet with the FDA when we complete the POC efficacy study to further discuss the development plan, especially the design of the pivotal studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P109_S2	If the results from the POC efficacy study are positive, we plan to seek a Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P109_S3	The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is a new and uncertain process, in which the majority of requests for designation have been denied.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P110_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small tablet that rapidly disintegrates in saliva and delivers CBP across the mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P110_S1	In addition to CBP, TNX-102 SL contains excipients, which are well-characterized, are listed in the Inactive Ingredient Guide and are approved for pharmaceutical use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P110_S2	TNX-102 SL contains sublingual absorption-enabling ingredients that promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P110_S3	These include agents that favor a mildly basic salivary pH. We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P111_S0	In June 2007, we entered into a Feasibility and Option Agreement with Lipocine, which was amended in October 2010 (the Feasibility Agreement ).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P111_S1	Pursuant to the Feasibility Agreement, we identified and obtained an exclusive worldwide option on technology from Lipocine that employs mixtures of different types of lipids to envelop CBP molecules in the small intestine and facilitate absorption into the bloodstream.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P111_S2	We selected a candidate formulation, TNX-102 gelcap, based on properties that included the dispersion of CBP in simulated gastric or small-intestinal fluids and the stability of the formulation over time.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P111_S3	Lipocine was also engaged to manufacture gelatin capsules of TNX-102 gelcap for use in a pharmacokinetic trial, for which we reported results in April 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P111_S4	In March 2014, we completed the final report of the pharmacokinetic trial (the Final Report ) and had 30 days to decide whether to exercise the option to license certain technology owned by Lipocine.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P111_S5	Following our receipt of the Final Report, in March 2014, we notified Lipocine of our decision to not exercise the option, although we own all the work product, information and data from the studies conducted.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P112_S0	We believe the U.S. market for products that treat CNS conditions has several characteristics that make it an attractive market for pharmaceuticals, including that the customer base is driven by physicians who are involved in long-term care of patients with chronic disorders.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P113_S0	Patients with CNS disorders sometimes carry disease burdens that require long-term treatment.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P114_S0	We believe the market for FDA-approved FM treatments is underserved and that there is a constant need for new treatment options, since many prescription drugs provide relief only to some of the affected patients, only to some of some patients symptoms, or provide relief only for limited periods of time.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P115_S0	In 2007, Lyrica became the first medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P115_S1	Lyrica previously had been approved and marketed to treat pain in other conditions as well as epilepsy.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P115_S2	In 2008, Cymbalta became the second medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P115_S3	Cymbalta previously had been approved and marketed to treat depression.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P116_S0	FM shares a number of symptoms with depression, and a number of FM patients are believed to experience depression as a co-existing condition.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P117_S0	Savella was the third medicine approved by the FDA for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P118_S0	Savella s active ingredient, milnacipran, is approved for the treatment of depression in Europe.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P119_S0	As many products used for the treatment of FM are approved and marketed for other conditions, sales of these products related specifically to FM can only be estimated.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P119_S1	Based on information obtained from publicly available sources, we believe U.S. sales of prescription drugs specifically for the treatment of FM totaled approximately $1.5 billion in 2012, and we believe this segment had grown at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 14% in 2007 12.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P119_S2	Based on information obtained from publicly available sources, we believe 2012 sales of Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella were approximately $600 million, $475 million, and $100 million, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P119_S3	Cymbalta lost its U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P120_S0	Despite the availability of FDA approved products, we believe the current treatment options for FM continue to leave many patients dissatisfied.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P121_S0	Prior to 2007, the landscape of prescription drugs used to treat FM was characterized by off-label use of generically-available therapies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P121_S1	Drugs that had been prescribed as the primary treatments for FM were approved for other indications, with analgesics, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants among the categories receiving the greatest use by the FM population.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P121_S2	Despite the significant FM-related sales growth of the three products approved for FM following their approvals for this indication, according to market research performed by Frost and Sullivan on our behalf, the unit volume of medications prescribed to specifically treat FM had been nearly flat between 2007 and 2010, implying that the sales growth of the approved products was mainly driven by patients switching from off-label, generic medications to on-label, branded medications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P121_S3	In particular, these market dynamics are consistent with the interpretation that Lyrica s growth in FM was driven by switching from off-label analgesics, and Cymbalta s and Savella s growth in FM was driven by switching from off-label anti-depressants.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P121_S4	Increasingly, Cymbalta, Savella and Lyrica are recognized as central pain inhibitors and not just treatments for their original indications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S0	Despite the wide use of muscle relaxants by FM patients, this category lacks a product approved for FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S1	Demand continues to be satisfied by off-label medicines such as CBP, tizanidine, baclofen, carisoprodol and metaxalone.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S2	These muscle relaxants have generic and branded versions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S3	According to Frost and Sullivan, 48 million doses of the Flexeril brand and its associated CBP IR generic products were prescribed off-label for FM in 2010 and accounted for approximately 35% of the daily doses of muscle relaxants prescribed for FM that year.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S4	These figures indicate that muscle relaxants in general, and CBP in particular, have been widely adopted in FM despite the lack of an approval for this disorder.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S5	As FM patients do not typically experience muscle spasm, we believe that the use of muscle relaxants in FM is off-label from a regulatory perspective and provides therapeutic effects to FM patients that are different from those in treating muscle spasm.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P122_S6	Therefore, in FM, CBP acts as a central pain inhibitor and not as a muscle relaxant.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P123_S0	Despite the availability and use of a variety of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions, FM remains a significant unmet medical need.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P123_S1	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the approved medications, or discontinue therapy due to poor tolerability.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P123_S2	Prescription pain and sleep medications are often taken off-label for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic effect.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P124_S0	An important goal of FM treatment is to reduce the dependence on opiate analgesic as well as on benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medications by FM patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P124_S1	Since CBP has no recognized addictive potential, we believe that TNX-102 SL, if approved, could reduce the exposure of FM patients to medications that have not been shown to be effective in treating FM and are associated with significant safety risks.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	Developers of pharmaceutical treatments for syndromes and disorders that affect the CNS face special challenges.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	In many cases, the causes and exacerbating factors of CNS conditions remain unknown.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P126_S1	Frequently, key symptoms are known only by patient reports and cannot be objectively validated or measured.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P126_S2	Symptoms like pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, cognitive/concentration problems or altered mood are characteristics of more than one condition.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P126_S3	Often, physicians may not agree that a particular patient is affected by one or another condition or by more than one co-existing conditions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	CNS conditions are typically defined by committees of expert professionals who set criteria based on the presence of several symptoms or groups of symptoms.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P127_S1	Sometimes groups of subjective symptoms are insufficient to describe CNS disorders and further refinement of diagnostic categories can be achieved by patient demographics, such as gender, age or concurrent medical processes, such as menopause or adolescence.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	Many CNS conditions, including syndromes and disorders, have not yet been characterized by laboratory tests, such as blood tests or x-ray imaging.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P128_S1	However, laboratory tests are often important to exclude other conditions, such as inflammatory or infectious processes.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P128_S2	Consequently, a CNS condition is sometimes called a diagnosis of exclusion because inflammation and infection should typically be ruled out by laboratory tests before applying the criteria of groups of symptoms to diagnose it.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	Once a CNS condition is diagnosed, physicians may select from among treatment options based on a patient s symptoms and history.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	Some medications improve or relieve only one or another symptom in a condition.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P130_S1	Consequently, physicians may prescribe several different medications concurrently to treat individual symptoms or groups of symptoms.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	A desirable quality for CNS medications is the ability to relieve more than one symptom of a CNS condition.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P131_S1	Another desirable quality for CNS medications is safety, particularly if a medicine is safe enough to be used with other medicines concurrently or at different times of the day.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	We believe the market for the treatment of FM is underserved, which we believe fuels a need for new therapeutic options.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P132_S1	Due to the market acceptance of approved FM treatments Cymbalta, Lyrica and Savella, we believe there will be significant interest in effective and well-tolerated drug treatment options.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	We believe that if TNX-102 SL won FDA approval, it would be an appealing option because it is believed to act by a different mechanism of action from the currently approved products, and we expect TNX-102 SL will be recommended for use at bedtime.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	Lyrica is recommended for twice or three-times daily dosing.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P134_S1	Cymbalta was found effective at once-daily or twice-daily dosing and is generally restricted to daytime use and not recommended for bedtime use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S5	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S6	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P135_S7	Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	The markets for medicines to treat FM, PTSD, ETTH and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P136_S1	Eli Lilly (Cymbalta), Forest Laboratories (Savella), and Pfizer (Lyrica) market FDA approved drugs for FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P136_S2	Cymbalta lost its U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil) and Pfizer (Zoloft) market FDA approved drugs for PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P137_S1	Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	Non-prescription medications used for ETTH include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen and naproxen; acetaminophen; and aspirin.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P138_S1	Medications prescribed for ETTH include Fiorinal, Fiorinal with Codeine, Fioricet, and their generic equivalents.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P139_S0	As of March 2014, we are aware of several companies developing prescription medications for FM, including Allergan, Chelsea Therapeutics, Meda, Merck, Pfizer, RiboCor and Theravance.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P139_S1	Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P140_S0	Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of FM include:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P141_S0	benzodiazepine as well as non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P142_S0	A number of companies are developing prescription medications for PTSD, including AstraZeneca, Biotie, Forest, GlaxoSmithKline, Lundbeck, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Nanotherapeutics, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and UCB.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P142_S1	Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of PTSD include anti-depressants, such as nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; and certain atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and risperidone.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P143_S0	A number of companies are developing prescription medications for tension-type headache, including Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P144_S0	We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P144_S1	Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P144_S2	As of March 21, 2014, we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to five issued U.S. patents and 26 issued non-U.S. patents.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P144_S3	We are actively pursuing an additional 13 U.S. patent applications, of which three are provisional and 10 are non-provisional, four international patent applications, and 21 non-U.S. patent applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P145_S0	We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P145_S1	We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P145_S2	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P146_S0	Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P146_S1	We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P147_S0	We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P147_S1	For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P148_S0	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P148_S1	In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P149_S0	In the United States, a patent s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P150_S0	The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P150_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20 year term of the patent for the approved product.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P150_S2	The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P150_S3	A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P150_S4	Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P150_S5	When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P151_S0	The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our three most advanced product candidates as of March 21, 2014 are summarized below.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P152_S0	Our VLD CBP bedtime treatment technology was discovered by Dr. Iredell W. Iglehart, MD and was sold to Vela Pharmaceuticals and is termed the Iglehart Technology .
1430306_14_ITEM1_P152_S1	We acquired the Iglehart Technology from L L, which acquired it from Vela Pharmaceuticals.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P152_S2	The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the Iglehart Technology includes patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing CBP, CBP formulations, and methods for treating FM and other CNS conditions utilizing CBP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P152_S3	The Iglehart Technology portfolio includes issued U.S. patents, such as U.S. Patent Nos. 6,541,523, 6,395,788 and 6,358,944, and corresponding issued foreign counterpart patents or applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P152_S4	U.S. Patent Nos. 6,541,523, 6,395,788 and 6,358,944 are expected to expire in 2020, unless they are eligible for patent term extensions on the basis of FDA approvals.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P153_S0	The unique pharmacokinetic profile of TNX-102 was discovered by Tonix and its development partners and is termed the PK Technology.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P153_S1	The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the PK Technology includes patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing CBP, CBP formulations, and methods for treating FM and other CNS conditions utilizing CBP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P153_S2	The PK Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 13/918,692.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P153_S3	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2033, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P154_S0	Certain Eutectic Compositions were discovered by development partners and are termed the Eutectic Technology.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P154_S1	The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the Eutectic Technology includes patent applications directed to eutectic compositions containing CBP, eutectic CBP formulations, methods for treating FM and other CNS conditions utilizing eutectic CBP compositions, and methods of manufacturing eutectic CBP compositions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P154_S2	The Eutectic Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. patent applications, such as U.S. Patent Application No. 14/214,433.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P154_S3	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P155_S0	The patent portfolio for TNX-201, relating to isometheptene isomers and termed the Isometheptene Technology includes patent applications directed to a purified isomer of isometheptene, pharmaceutical compositions containing isometheptene, isometheptene formulations, methods for modulating headache and other CNS conditions and treating CNS conditions utilizing isometheptene isomers, and methods of manufacturing isometheptene isomers.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P156_S0	The Isometheptene Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 14/158,735 as well as U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P156_S1	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P157_S0	The patent portfolio for disulfiram and selegiline combinations includes patents and patent applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P157_S1	It includes claims directed to disulfiram and selegiline, pharmaceutical compositions containing disulfiram and selegiline, disulfiram and selegiline formulations, methods of treating an alcohol use disorder, and methods of modulating alcohol abuse and dependence.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P157_S2	It includes issued U.S. Patent Nos. 8,093,300 and 8,481,599.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P157_S3	The patent expiring last is expected to expire in 2024, excluding any patent term extensions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P158_S0	We are currently developing TNX-102 SL for the management of post-traumatic stress disorder, an indication that is relevant to biodefense.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P158_S1	In March 2014, we acquired the rights to develop two additional biodefense technologies: a new drug candidate that potentially protects humans from certain effects of radiation and a new vaccine candidate against smallpox.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P158_S2	With respect to the radioprotection drug candidate, we acquired U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,203,733 and related intellectual property rights.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P159_S0	The radio- and chemo-protective technology relates to proprietary forms of a small molecular pharmaceutical agent, which is believed to protect against ionizing radiation after oral administration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P160_S0	With respect to the smallpox vaccine candidate, the Company acquired US non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,207,727 and related intellectual property rights.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P160_S1	The smallpox vaccine technology relates to proprietary forms of live vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P160_S2	We believe that these technologies, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P161_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P161_S1	For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S0	Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S2	These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S3	We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S4	While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S5	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P162_S6	To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P163_S0	We seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P163_S1	We have applied for a trademark for Tonix Pharmaceuticals in the United States.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P164_S0	Our current patents owned are as follows:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P165_S0	Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, U.K.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P166_S0	Our current pending patent applications are as follows:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P167_S0	We have one trademark application that is pending as follows:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P168_S0	We have one employee dedicated to research and development.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P168_S1	We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase several fold as we advance TNX-102 SL into late-stage clinical development and advance other candidates in our pipeline.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P168_S2	We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P168_S3	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P168_S4	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P169_S0	We have contracted with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL for investigational purposes, including preclinical and clinical testing, as follows:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P170_S0	All of our compounds are small molecules, synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available raw materials.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P171_S0	The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P171_S1	These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P171_S2	The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P171_S3	Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P172_S0	The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P172_S1	The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P173_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P174_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P175_S0	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P175_S1	The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P175_S2	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P176_S0	The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator s brochure.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P176_S1	An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P176_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P176_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P177_S0	An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P177_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P177_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P178_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P178_S1	Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P179_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P180_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P181_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P182_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P182_S1	Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P183_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P183_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease, but sometimes can include several thousand patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P183_S2	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P184_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P184_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P184_S2	Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P184_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P185_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P186_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P186_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P186_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P187_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S1	We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S2	Although the clinical development of TNX-201 can be accelerated due to existing marketing experience, we expect to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for TNX-201 and for certain other products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S3	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S4	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S5	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P188_S6	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P189_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P189_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P190_S0	Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P190_S1	As such, we plan to submit NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P190_S2	The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for FM or PTSD as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P190_S3	If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P190_S4	If the FDA requires full NDAs for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P190_S5	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P191_S0	Based on our intent to file under Section 505(b)(2) with respect to our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, we believe it is unlikely the development process for this product candidate will follow the ordinary course of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P192_S0	Our human pharmacokinetic studies of TNX-102 SL represented the first use of sublingual CBP in humans and could therefore be described as Phase 1.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P192_S1	However, because these studies compared TNX-102 SL to existing approved formulations of CBP and specified the comparable ability to deliver effective levels of CBP to the bloodstream of FM patients, these studies provide a reference to the therapeutic effects previously observed in our dose-ranging clinical study of TNX-102 capsules in FM patients.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P192_S2	For these reasons, rather than always identifying clinical trials by Phase, we find it more illustrative to describe in a narrative form the purpose of the studies and the nature and potential significance of the results.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P193_S0	Because our double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study on bedtime CBP was performed in Canada, we did not meet with the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to discuss our approach and plans until August 2011.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P193_S1	In February 2013, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical and nonclinical requirements to register TNX-102 SL for the management of FM based on the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P194_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P194_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed by the FDA for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P194_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P194_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P195_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P196_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P196_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P197_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_14_ITEM1_P197_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P198_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P198_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P198_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P199_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P200_S0	The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P200_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P200_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P200_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P200_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P201_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P202_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P202_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P202_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P202_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P202_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P203_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P203_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P204_S0	On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P204_S1	FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation Breakthrough Therapy.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P204_S2	A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P205_S0	preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P206_S0	If a drug is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P206_S1	In the event that our POC study of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is successful, we will request Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P206_S2	The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is relatively new, and the majority of requests for designation have been denied.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P206_S3	We cannot predict the likelihood of success in seeking Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P207_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P207_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P207_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P207_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P207_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_14_ITEM1_P208_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P209_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P209_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P210_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P211_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P211_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P211_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P212_S0	In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, became law.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P212_S1	This legislation grants significant new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P212_S2	In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information, and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P212_S3	In addition, the new law significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P212_S4	Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P213_S0	The FDA has not yet implemented many of the provisions of the FDAAA, so we cannot predict the impact of the new legislation on the pharmaceutical industry or our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P213_S1	However, the requirements and changes imposed by the FDAAA may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P213_S2	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P213_S3	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P214_S0	As of March 26, 2014, we had six full-time employees, of whom three are executives, one is finance and investor relations, and two are administrative.
1430306_14_ITEM1_P214_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company and its prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of products that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, development and laboratory testing and clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We cannot assure you that we will ever have a product approved by the FDA, that we will bring any product to market or, if we are successful in doing so, that we will ever become profitable.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities increase.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are a development stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our operations to date have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or commercialized products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial condition has varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include other factors described elsewhere in this annual report and also include:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance policies.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Accordingly, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have no approved products on the market and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We currently have one lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM, and the success of our business currently depends on its successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	TNX-102 SL has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for this product candidate anywhere in the world.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The clinical development program for TNX-102 SL may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective or the clinical program may be put on hold due to unexpected safety issues with marketed CBP products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approval for TNX-102 SL in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because we have limited financial and human resources, we are currently focusing on the regulatory approval of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our spending on existing and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and clinical trials and marketing activities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next twelve months.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to initiate clinical trials or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our lead product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors' products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents on products we develop.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO") and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our success depends on our patents, patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine the priority of inventions.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, PTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Also, a third party may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	An adverse decision in litigation could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Interference proceedings brought before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to our patents or patent applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	During an interference proceeding, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Even if successful, an interference proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If preclinical testing or clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including CROs and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical testing or clinical trials involving our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical testing or clinical trials than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical testing or clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical trials, consistent with a clinical trial protocol.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Delays in preclinical and clinical testing could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Once a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If clinical trials are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	While we have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We will control only certain aspects of our CROs activities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that our clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA s current good clinical practices requirements, or cGCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with cGCPs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In addition, our clinical trials, including our Phase 2b/3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM, will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, our clinical trials may be delayed or we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our CROs are not our employees, and we are not able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P60_S3	As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for such product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for our clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have never conducted a pivotal clinical trial or submitted an NDA before, and may be unable to do so for TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If our Phase 2b/3 study of TNX-102 SL is successful, we then expect to conduct a Phase 3 confirmatory study in support of product registration.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As these trials are intended to provide evidence to support marketing approval by the FDA, they are considered pivotal trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The conduct of pivotal clinical trials and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Although members of our management team have extensive industry experience, including in the development, clinical testing and commercialization of drug candidates, our company has never conducted a pivotal clinical trial before, has limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings, and has not submitted an NDA before.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete these planned clinical trials in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials would prevent or delay commercialization of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our product candidates may cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects from TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The results of future clinical trials, including TNX-102 SL, may show that our product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If we are unable to file for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore possibly obtain a shortened review period for the applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013 to discuss the development of our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, in FM.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Although our interactions with the FDA have encouraged our efforts to continue to develop TNX-102 SL for FM, there is no assurance that we will satisfy the FDA s requirements for approval in this indication.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P70_S3	We have not come to any agreement with the FDA as to the nature and extent of studies we may be required to conduct in order to achieve approval of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P70_S4	The timeline for filing and review of our NDAs is based on our plan to submit those NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, wherein we will rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P70_S5	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our lead product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S7	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P71_S8	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications, and the FDA may not agree that our products qualify for marketing approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL, and we may need to fulfill the more extensive requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We will need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As we advance our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials and develop new product candidates, we will need to increase our product development, scientific and administrative headcount to manage these programs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	In addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	continue to improve our operational, manufacturing, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Sub since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Loss of the services of Dr. Lederman would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S3	We have key-man insurance on the lives of Dr. Lederman, Dr. Leland Gershell, our Chief Financial Officer, and Dr. Bruce Daugherty, our Chief Scientific Officer.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S4	We are also highly dependent on our directors and scientific team.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S5	We are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S6	While we have employment agreements with all our executives, they may terminate their employment at any time upon 30 days notice.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P78_S7	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P79_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Moreover, our work force is located in the "Pharmaceutical Corridor" that spans New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as in the San Francisco Bay Area, where competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in drug development, product registration, clinical and non-clinical research, quality compliance, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our trials, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We intend to rely on CMOs to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical trials and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates requires the manufacture of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P83_S3	We have contracted with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds, including TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P83_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P83_S5	Although we are in discussions with other manufacturers we have identified as potential alternative CMOs of TNX-102 SL, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms with any of them.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with many of these manufacturers.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P84_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for cGMP compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P87_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P88_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P91_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P95_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct "adequate and well controlled" clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P101_S1	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P101_S3	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials; the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or "clinical holds" requiring suspension or termination of the trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	The results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Our clinical trials may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our products are expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P103_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P103_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our products in clinical development.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P106_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to an NDA under the FDCA.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P106_S3	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P106_S4	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P107_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P107_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P107_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P107_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Following completion of clinical trials, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P111_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P111_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs-six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P111_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P111_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA is approved.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P113_S1	None of our product candidates has been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P116_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P117_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P120_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P121_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P122_S2	Physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P122_S3	If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P124_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our strategy with our lead product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S4	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S5	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P125_S6	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P126_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P126_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P129_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P129_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P129_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P130_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P130_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P130_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P130_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P130_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P130_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P131_S0	In the event that we are successful in bringing any products to market, our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products successfully may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P133_S0	other third party payors, including Medicare.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P134_S0	We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for health care products to be approved in the future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P134_S1	Third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P134_S2	Government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P134_S3	Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P135_S0	The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P135_S1	If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any prescription product we bring to market, doctors may not prescribe them or patients may ask to have their physicians prescribe competing drugs with more favorable reimbursement.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P136_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P136_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P136_S2	In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P136_S3	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P136_S4	Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P137_S0	If we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P138_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercialization outside of the United States, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P138_S1	We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P139_S0	difficulty in importing and exporting clinical trial materials and study samples.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P140_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators' drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S3	While we currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S4	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S5	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S6	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators' products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P141_S7	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P142_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P142_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P143_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P143_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P144_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P144_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P145_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P145_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P146_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P146_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P147_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P149_S0	We carry insurance for most categories of risk that our business may encounter, however, we may not have adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P149_S1	We currently maintain general liability, clinical trial, key man, property, workers compensation, products liability and directors and officers insurance, along with an umbrella policy, which collectively costs approximately $200,000 per annum.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P149_S2	We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to maintain existing insurance at current or adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P149_S3	Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P150_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P151_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Sales of additional shares of our common stock, including by us or our directors and officers following expiration or early release of the lock-up periods, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, by us or others, including the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P153_S1	In connection with a public offering in January 2014, our directors and officers have entered into lock-up agreements for 90 days following such offering (which period may be extended under certain circumstances).
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P153_S2	Our directors and officers may be released from lock-up prior to the expiration of the lock-up periods at the sole discretion of Roth Capital Partners, LLC.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P153_S3	We may sell additional shares and our directors and officers, upon expiration or earlier release of the lock-up, may sell shares into the market, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P155_S0	If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P155_S1	Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P155_S2	In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ s listing requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P156_S0	The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P157_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P157_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P157_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P158_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P159_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P160_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P160_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P161_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P162_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P162_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P162_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P162_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P162_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P163_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P164_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P164_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P164_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P165_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P166_S0	The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P167_S0	Our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P167_S1	As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P167_S2	Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P168_S0	The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P169_S0	Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create a series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P170_S0	Efforts to comply with recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and require additional management resources, and we still may fail to comply.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P171_S0	As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, in the event we are no longer a smaller reporting company, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements would be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P171_S1	Such attestation requirement by our independent registered public accounting firm would not be applicable to us until the report for the year ended December 31, 2014 at the earliest, if at all.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P171_S2	If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is required to, but is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P172_S0	Because certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P173_S0	As of March 24, 2014, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 21.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P173_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P173_S2	In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P173_S3	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P174_S0	discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P175_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P176_S0	The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P176_S1	Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P176_S2	Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
1430306_14_ITEM1A_P176_S3	If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1430306_14_ITEM1B_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	On February 11, 2014, we entered into a Lease Amendment and Expansion Agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	Including the additional premises, the total square footage of our office space is approximately 4,800.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	An increase to the original Letter of Credit will be required in the amount of $72,354.24.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The amended base rent is as follows:
1430306_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	Starting April 1, 2014, we will be renting two offices on a month-to-month basis at 900 E. Hamilton, Suite 100, Campbell, California 95008.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	The combined monthly rent will be approximately $3,240.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current business requirements.
1430306_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	We maintain websites at www.tonixpharma.com and www.krele.com and the information contained on those websites is not deemed to be a part of this annual report.
1430306_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1430306_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	On August 9, 2013, our common stock commenced trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Prior to August 9, 2013, our common stock was traded on the OTCQB under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Prior to July 23, 2012, our common stock was quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol TNXP.OB.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	Prior to February 2012, no public trades occurred in our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, the OTCQB or the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, as applicable.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	On March 24, 2014, the closing sale price of our common stock, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, was $11.13 per share.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	On March 24, 2014, there were 230 holders of record of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business.
1430306_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.
1430306_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may will, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and continue, or similar words.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P1_S5	Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company s services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel pharmaceutical products for challenging disorders of the CNS.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	We have a pipeline of product candidates led by TNX-102 SL, which is in pivotal development for FM and represents a new class of medication for this disorder.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect to report initial results from our ongoing Phase 2b/3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	TNX-102 SL is also in development for PTSD, and is expected to enter a Phase 2 trial in this indication in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	We are developing TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH, and we plan to begin clinical studies of TNX-201 in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	We hold worldwide commercialization rights to TNX-102 SL and TNX-201.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P2_S6	Our pipeline also includes a program for the treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence, and protection from smallpox and radiation exposure.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We are pursuing FM as our lead indication for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our therapeutic strategy is supported by positive results from a Phase 2a trial of TNX-102 capsules in FM patients, which demonstrated a significant decrease in pain and other symptoms after eight weeks of treatment.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Following the completion of this study, as well the completion of several clinical pharmacokinetic studies of TNX-102 SL, we met with the FDA and announced that the agency indicated that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled safety and efficacy studies as well as the fulfillment of long-term safety exposure requirements for chronic use would support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We are currently conducting a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL for the improvement of pain in people with FM (the BESTFIT trial), from which we expect to report initial results in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	We are also conducting a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL, into which patients who have completed the BESTFIT study may enroll.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	Following the completion of the BESTFIT trial, we plan to complete the remaining aspects of our development program that are needed for an NDA submission under Section 505(b)(2), including the conduct at least one more pivotal trial in FM.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	We believe that TNX-102 SL also has the potential to address a range of other neuropsychiatric conditions, including PTSD.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P3_S7	We have met with the FDA to discuss the development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD, and we plan to begin a Phase 2 trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety as a treatment for patients with PTSD in the third quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	We are developing another candidate, TNX-201, for the treatment of ETTH.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We have met with the FDA to discuss the development of TNX-201 for ETTH, and we plan to conduct a human pharmacology study in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Although the development of TNX-201 will be based on the available information of previously-approved, but currently-unapproved, products that contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient in TNX-201, we believe the marketing approval of TNX-201 will be required to conform with the NDA requirements under Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 under the 505(b)(2) provision as a treatment for alcohol abuse and dependence, and plan to begin formulation work on TNX-301 in 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We also recently acquired rights to intellectual property on two biodefense technologies: one relates to the development of novel smallpox vaccines, and the other the development of protective agents against radiation exposure.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We plan to perform non-clinical research and development on these programs in 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	As we interact with the United States Department of Defense and related biodefense agencies regarding our development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD, we believe these technologies will expand our interaction and cooperation with such agencies.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Commercializing certain biodefense products in the United States does not always require human efficacy studies, which leads us to believe the cost and risk of bringing these products to market will be reduced, related to other NCEs or new biologicals.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	On October 7, 2011, we executed and consummated the Share Exchange Agreement with Tonix Sub.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Pursuant to the Share Exchange, each share of Tonix Sub s common stock was exchanged for 0.045 shares of our common stock, and each share of Tonix Sub s Series A and B preferred stock was exchanged for 0.24 shares of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Sub shareholders, including holders of 1,396,982 restricted shares, which were subject to accelerated vesting, received in exchange for all of their shares, an aggregate of 1,133,334 shares of our common stock and our existing shareholders retained 200,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	The 1,133,334 shares issued to the Tonix Sub shareholders constituted approximately 85% of our 1,333,334 shares of common stock issued and outstanding after the Share Exchange.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	For accounting purposes, the acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of Tonix Sub, accompanied by the issuance of our common stock for the outstanding common stock of Toxic Sub, which was recorded at a nominal value.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S6	The historical financial statements are those of Tonix Sub.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S7	The accompanying financial statements give retroactive effect to the recapitalization as if it had occurred on June 7, 2007 (inception date).
1430306_14_ITEM7_P8_S8	Also, professional services expenses were allocated to research and development and general and administrative expenses in the cumulative from inception through December 31, 2012 statement of operations to be consistent with the current period s presentation.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing our lead product, TNX-102 SL, but we also expend increasing effort on our other pipeline programs, including TNX-201.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing work and the cost of drug ingredients used in such work, fees paid to consultants for work related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy and safety of our drugs.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are currently conducting our BESTFIT study, a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	We also plan to begin a Phase 2 trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD in the third quarter of 2014, as well as advance TNX-201 for ETTH into clinical studies in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Clinical trials can be very expensive.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	If these and additional necessary clinical trials are successful, we plan to prepare and submit applications to the FDA for marketing approval for our drug candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	As a result of these and other factors, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next 12 to 24 months.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We expect that a larger percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected patient recruitment, or government delays.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold .
1430306_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	We had no revenues or cost of goods sold during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 were $4,649,782, an increase of $2,066,474, or 80%, from $2,583,308 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	This increase is primarily due to increased development work related to TNX-102 SL, including formulation development, manufacturing, human safety and efficacy as well as pharmacokinetic studies, offset by a decrease in non-clinical studies.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	In 2013, we incurred $1,161,098, $1,418,589 and $431,871 in manufacturing cost, clinical activities and cost, and non-clinical activities and cost, respectively, as compared to $552,953, $836,278 and $468,509 in 2012, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 were $6,238,661, an increase of $2,160,559, or 53%, from $4,078,102 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	This increase is primarily due to payroll related expenses and professional services.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Payroll related expenses increased to $3,247,689 in the current year from $1,820,877 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $1,426,812, or 78%.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	We incurred $1,717,037 in stock based compensation in connection with the vesting of stock options issued to board members, officers and employees in 2013 as compared to $865,157 in stock based compensation in 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	The increase in cash payroll related costs of $574,932 was primarily a result of the hiring of new employees as well as employee bonuses.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Professional services for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $1,882,080, an increase of $437,625, or 30%, over the $1,444,455 recognized for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Of professional services, legal fees totaled $902,714 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $437,191, or 94%, from $465,523 incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	Of the legal fees incurred, $458,143 were patent related costs in the 2013 year as compared to $131,362 in 2012.

1430306_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	Accounting fees incurred in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $244,332 and $244,164, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 were $313,883, an increase of $205,635, or 190%, from $108,248 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to investor relations activities, which accounted for the primary increase from 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	Rent for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 totaled $116,569 and $116,732, respectively.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	Market research and analysis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 was $48,161, a decrease of $181,385 or 79% from $229,546 incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P20_S4	Depreciation expense in fiscal 2013 totaled $16,591, an increase of $2,262, or 16%, over the expense of $14,329 incurred in fiscal 2012, as a result of the purchase of new office computers.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Change in fair value of warrant liability .
1430306_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	In connection with our January and March 2012 financing, we issued warrants that contained certain reset provisions.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	As such, we were required to record the fair value as a liability and mark to market each reporting period.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	In June 2012, upon the effectiveness of our registration statement, these reset provisions expired.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Therefore we adjusted the fair value of the warrants from their initial issuance in January and March 2012, charged operations in 2012 for the increase in fair value of $1,177,026 and reclassified the fair value of warrants to equity.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Interest income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $4,400, as compared to interest expense of $1,613,043 incurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $1,617,443.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, our interest costs were comprised primarily of a beneficial conversion feature related to our issuance of convertible debentures in December 2012 charged to interest of $710,000, $196,166 of deferred financing costs related to the issuance of our secured convertible debentures in October 2011 and December 2012, allocated offering costs of $270,743 charged to interest as part of a financing, and the fair value of $426,152, net with prior period accrual, of common stock and warrants issued to convertible debentures holders in connection with the conversion to a financing.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	In addition, in 2012 we incurred interest expense related to our convertible debentures of $12,292, net with interest income of $2,310.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	As a result of the foregoing, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $10,884,043, compared to a net loss of $9,449,600 for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had working capital of $6,941,189, comprised primarily of cash of $8,201,622, offset by $765,417 of accounts payable, $1,165,670 of accrued expenses and $280,000 of promissory notes to related parties.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	A significant portion of the accounts payable and accrued expenses are due to work performed in relation to our ongoing Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we used approximately $8,517,000 and $5,713,000 of cash in operating activities, respectively, which represent cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	Increases in cash outlays principally resulted from manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical cost and activities, regulatory cost, and payroll.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2013, net proceeds from financing activities were from the sale of our common stock and warrants of approximately $10,042,000, the exercise of warrants of $4,581,000, and from the sale of promissory notes to related parties for $280,000.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S5	In the comparable 2012 period, approximately $6,933,000 was raised through the sale of shares of common stock and warrants, $320,000 from sale of notes payable and $390,000 from the sale of convertible debentures, net with $150,000 repayments.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P25_S6	At December 31, 2013, we had cash of $8,201,622 compared to $1,785,390 at December 31, 2012.

1430306_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $15,000 reflecting purchase of equipment as compared to cash used for the year ended December 31, 2012 of approximately $36,000 also reflecting purchase of equipment.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	On August 9, 2013, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement ) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as representative of the underwriters named therein (the Underwriters ) (the Underwriters ), pursuant to which we agreed to offer to the public through the Underwriters an aggregate of 2,680,000 units (each a Unit , and collectively, the Units ) at a public offering price of $4.25 per Unit in an underwritten public offering (the "Offering").
1430306_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Each Unit consists of (i) one share of our common stock and (ii) one Series A Warrant (the Warrants ) to purchase one share of common stock.

1430306_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Offering closed on August 14, 2013.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The Underwriters purchased the Units at an eight-percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of approximately $0.34.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	We received net cash proceeds of $10,038,013 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $440,787 payable by us associated with the Offering.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	On August 14, 2013, the Underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase additional Warrants to purchase 402,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Underwriters also received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 107,200 shares of Common Stock, or four percent of the total number of shares included in the Units.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $4.25 per share, subject to anti-dilutive adjustment, and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Warrants will be exercisable on a "cashless" basis in certain circumstances.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	As of March 26, 2014, 1,184,264 of the Warrants remain outstanding.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the Warrants.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	On January 24, 2014, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Second Underwriting Agreement ) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as representative of several underwriters (collectively, the Second Underwriters ), relating to the issuance and sale of 2,898,550 shares of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	The public offering price for each share of common stock was $15.00.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares of common stock was approximately $40.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Company granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 434,782 shares of Common Stock to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	The offering closed on January 29, 2014 and the over-allotment option expired unexercised.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to additional clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	We believe our existing cash is sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for at least the next 12 months.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	We presently do not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Due to our history and historical operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	We may need to obtain additional capital in order to fund future research and development activities.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P37_S5	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	We have entered into an agreement with Lederman Co., LLC ( Lederman Co ), a company under the control of Dr. Seth Lederman, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Effective October 15, 2013, Lederman Co received $325,000 per annum for its consulting services.

1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 550,000 shares of our common stock to officers, directors, employees and consultants.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Under the terms of the 2012 Plan, we may issue Incentive Stock Options, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and nonstatutory options.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The Board of Directors determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the options granted under the 2012 Plan.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option must be at least 100% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant (or 110% for any shareholder that owns 10% or more of our common stock).
1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	The fair market value of the common stock determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in a good faith.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the 2012 Plan should not be more than five years and expiration period not more than ten years.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P45_S7	We reserved 550,000 shares of our common stock for future issuance under the terms of the 2012 Plan.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	In May 2012, we issued options to purchase 175,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2012 Plan, with such options vesting 1/3 rd on May 9, 2013 and 1/36 th on the 9 th of each month thereafter for 24 months, having an exercise price of $30.00 and expiring 10 years from date of issuance.

1430306_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	In September 2010, we entered into a five-year lease for office space in New York City.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	We issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $60,000 for the benefit of the landlord, which is collateralized by a money market account.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	On February 11, 2014, we entered into a Lease Amendment and Expansion Agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Including the additional premises, the total square footage of the office space is approximately 4,776.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	An increase to the original Letter of Credit will be required in the amount of $72,354.24.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	Our future minimum lease payments under the amended operating lease are as follows:
1430306_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Tonix outsources its research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.

1430306_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We do not intend our use or display of other companies trade names or trademarks to imply an endorsement or sponsorship of us by such companies, or any relationship with any of these companies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	We were incorporated on November 16, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Tamandare Explorations Inc. From inception through October 2011, we were involved in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties in the State of Nevada.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	On October 7, 2011, we executed and consummated the share exchange transaction, or the Share Exchange, by and among the Company, Tonix Sub and the stockholders of Tonix Sub, or the Tonix Shareholders.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	In the Share Exchange, the Tonix Shareholders exchanged their shares of Tonix Sub for newly issued shares of common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	As a result, upon completion of the Share Exchange, Tonix Sub became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Upon completion of the Share Exchange, the Tonix Shareholders received an aggregate of 1,133,334 shares of our common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	75,000 shares of common stock were returned to us from the prior officer, which were retired, and our existing shareholders retained 200,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	The 1,133,334 shares issued to the Tonix Shareholders constituted approximately 85% of our 1,333,334 issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after the consummation of the Share Exchange.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	As a result of the Share Exchange, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Tonix Sub and consequently, control of the business and operations of Tonix Sub and Krele.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	From and after the consummation of the Share Exchange, our primary operations consist of the business and operations of Tonix Sub.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	On October 11, 2011, we changed our name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. to reflect our new business.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	In 1996, Seth Lederman, MD, and Donald Landry, MD, PhD, formed L L Technologies LLC, or L L, to develop medications for central nervous system, or CNS, conditions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Dr. Lederman is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Landry is a Director.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	L L was a founder of Janus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which later became Vela Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vela, which developed various therapeutics, including a very low dose, or VLD, version of cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, under an agreement with L L. Vela decided to focus its resources on other programs and transferred the rights to VLD CBP and certain other technologies to L L in March 2006.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Tonix Sub formed in June 2007 as Krele Pharmaceuticals, Inc. by L L and Plumbline LLC, or Plumbline.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Dr. Lederman is Managing Partner of Plumbline.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Plumbline possessed rights to certain technology for the treatment of alcohol dependence and abuse.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	In connection with founding Tonix Sub, L L and Plumbline entered into an intellectual property transfer and assignment agreement with Tonix Sub for the purpose of assigning patents and transferring intellectual property and know-how in exchange for shares of common stock of Tonix Sub.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	As a result of economic conditions related to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, Tonix Sub was not successful in raising money to fund its programs until 2009.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	As a result, Tonix Sub was unable to advance the development programs and had little activity except for prosecuting and maintaining patents and maintaining contracts.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	In 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation to analyze the sleep data from a Phase 2a trial of nighttime VLD CBP in fibromyalgia, or FM ( the Moldofsky Study ).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Moldofsky Study was conducted in Canada by the Toronto Psychiatric Research Foundation, and Tonix Sub obtained the data from this study from L L.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition, in 2009, Tonix Sub contracted with Caliper Life Sciences Inc., or Caliper, to analyze the interactions of CBP with certain receptors.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	In June 2010, Tonix Sub entered into consulting agreements with L L and Lederman Co., LLC, or Lederman Co, and also acquired certain rights to develop isometheptene mucate as a treatment for certain types of headaches from Lederman Co.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	Dr. Lederman is managing partner of Lederman Co. Between June 2010 and October 2011, Tonix Sub was active in recruiting new officers and directors and initiating preclinical and clinical development of novel CBP formulations.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	In July 2010, Tonix Sub changed its name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	In August 2010, we formed Krele to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate New Drug Application, or NDA, products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	We anticipate that when our branded products lose patent protection, Krele may market authorized generic versions of them.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Krele also may develop or acquire generic products approved under ANDAs and we may market branded versions (branded generics) of such products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Krele has been issued a state license in New York.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	On April 23, 2013, Tonix Sub formed Tonix Canada.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Tonix Canada is intended to perform research and development efforts in Canada.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	As a Canadian entity, we expect Tonix Canada will be entitled to receive certain reimbursable tax credits for research expenditures in Canada.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	On October 29, 2014, Tonix Sub formed Tonix International Holding for the purpose of acquiring the rights to develop and commercialize Tonix products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Tonix International Holding formed Tonix Ireland for the purpose of manufacturing, trading and developing Tonix products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	On December 15, 2014, Tonix Sub and Tonix International Holding entered into an intercompany license agreement whereby Tonix Sub granted Tonix International Holding a non-exclusive right to exercise certain product technologies and related intangible rights.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	As consideration, Tonix International Holding paid licensing fees to Tonix Sub.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	On October 24, 2013, Tonix Sub formed Tonix Barbados.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	Tonix Barbados had previously entered into a license agreement and a cost-sharing agreement with Tonix Sub, pursuant to which Tonix Barbados acquired the rights to develop and commercialize certain products (TNX-102 SL and TNX-201) for non-U.S. markets.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the first quarter of 2015, Tonix Barbados is expected to be dissolved and its assets are to be transferred to Tonix International Holding.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel prescription products for common yet challenging medical disorders.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our clinical-stage product candidates, TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablet) and TNX-201 ((R)-isometheptene mucate), are directed toward conditions affecting the CNS.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	In the second quarter of 2015, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of our most advanced candidate, TNX-102 SL, for the treatment of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	We are also developing TNX-102 SL as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and we commenced a Phase 2 trial for this indication in January 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	We expect to begin a Phase 2 trial of TNX-201 in episodic tension-type headache, or ETTH, in the second quarter of 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S5	Our pipeline includes a preclinical program for the treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence as well as two preclinical biodefense programs (for protection from smallpox virus and from radiation injury).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P24_S6	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our pipeline addresses disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies and represent large potential commercial opportunities.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	Our clinical-stage product candidates are as follows:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing cyclobenzaprine for sublingual administration that we are developing for two indications, both of which are underserved by currently available therapies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Fibromyalgia is a debilitating syndrome that occurs in up to 15% of U.S. adults and is associated with a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in careers or education.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for FM, or discontinue therapy due to poor tolerability.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Prescription pain and sleep medications not approved for FM are frequently taken for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic effect.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to broadly and effectively treat the core symptoms of FM with a tolerability profile that is suitable as a first-line therapy and for chronic use.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	An estimated 3.5% of adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD, and antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that TNX-102 SL may be ideally suited to address the need for a treatment for PTSD that is effective, safe, and well-tolerated.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	TNX-201 is an oral formulation of (R)-isometheptene mucate that we are developing for ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	It is estimated that approximately 75 million U.S. adults experience frequent ETTH episodes (one to 15 headaches per month over a three-month period), and although the majority of people who suffer ETTH are able to adequately manage their symptoms through the use of over-the-counter products, many seek prescription options, all of which contain barbiturates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Although the approved prescription products for ETTH may have some therapeutic value in treating the primary headache condition, they are associated with significant safety liabilities and pose a risk of abuse and addiction.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	We are developing TNX-201 with the goal of introducing a safe, effective, and non-addictive prescription treatment option for ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of FM, PTSD, ETTH and other central nervous system disorders.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including TNX-102 SL and TNX-201.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	The principal components of our strategy are to:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Develop TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 for multiple central nervous system disorders .
1430306_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	We currently are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for two separate indications, FM and PTSD, and we are developing TNX-201 for ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Maximize the commercial potential of TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 .
1430306_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	We plan to commercialize TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 for their respective indications either on our own or through collaboration with partners.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	We believe TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates .
1430306_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	In the case of TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	In the case of TNX-201, we own patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter as well as our discoveries which relate to its molecular target.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	In the cases of TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates .
1430306_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, TNX-201, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	In the future, we may explore the development of TNX-201 for the treatment of migraine headaches.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our product candidates address diseases that are not well served by currently available therapies and represent large potential commercial market opportunities.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Background information on the diseases and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates is set forth below.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	According to published estimates, there are approximately five to fifteen million people suffering from FM in the U.S.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	(Vincent et al, Arthritis Care Res 2013;65:786-792; Lawrence et al, Arthritis Rheum 2008;58:26-35).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The peak incidence of FM occurs between 20-50 years of age, and 80-90% of diagnosed patients are female.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	FM may have a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in careers or education.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Three drugs, pregabalin (Lyrica ), duloxetine (Cymbalta ), and milnacipran (Savella ), are approved by the FDA for the management of FM, and a variety of drugs are used off-label by FM patients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Despite these interventions, FM remains a significant unmet medical need.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the approved medications, or discontinue therapy due to poor tolerability.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	Prescription pain and sleep medications are widely used for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic effect.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	An important goal of FM treatment is to reduce the use of opiate analgesics as well as of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medications typically used by FM patients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	PTSD is a chronic syndrome that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	An estimated 3.5% of American adults, or approximately 8.5 million individuals, suffer from PTSD, of whom we believe only about half seek some form of treatment (Kessler et al, Arch Gen Psych 2005;62:617-627; Wang et al, Arch Gen Psych 2005;62:629-640).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	PTSD is a significant problem among armed forces veterans and other military personnel, but also occurs frequently in the civilian population.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The treatment of PTSD typically involves a multidimensional approach that includes pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Two antidepressant drugs, paroxetine (Paxil ) and sertraline (Zoloft ), are FDA-approved for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Other antidepressants, as well as sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics, are commonly prescribed off-label despite generally weak clinical evidence in support of their use.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	With the exception of certain antidepressants, there is also little evidence to support relapse prevention in the chronic setting for those who initially improve with acute pharmacotherapy.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Patients often take several medications concurrently to address multiple symptoms.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Sleep disturbances play a central role in PTSD, and present a difficult therapeutic challenge.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	For example, in 2009, although 30% of veterans with PTSD were prescribed benzodiazepines, a class of sedative-hypnotic medication (Lund et al, J Clin Psych 2012;73:292-296), evidence suggests that these drugs interfere with recovery from, and increase the incidence of, PTSD (van Minnen et al, Behav Res Ther 2002;40:439-57) and are not recommended per current guidelines (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2010).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Co-morbid alcohol and substance abuse and dependence, which occur frequently in the PTSD population, generally complicate the use of sedative-hypnotics in these patients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	ETTH is the most common type of headache, estimated to account for over 60% of headaches (Stovner et al, Cephalalgia 2007;27:193-210).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Tension-type headache pain is often described as a constant pressure on both sides of the head, and typically lasts from thirty minutes to several days.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	It is estimated that approximately 75 million U.S. adults experience frequent ETTH episodes, defined as one to 15 tension-type headaches per month over a three-month period (derived from Schwartz et al, JAMA 1998;279:381-383; Chowdhury, Ann Ind Acad Neurol 2012;15:83-88).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	Approximately 60% receive treatment (derived from Scher et al, Cephalalgia 2010;30:321-328).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P50_S4	Non-migraine headaches, of which approximately 80% are estimated to be ETTH (Stovner et al, 2007), lead to 9.2 million visits to emergency departments or physician offices each year (IMS Health, National Disease and Therapeutic Index, period 2008-2014).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	Many people who suffer from ETTH are able to adequately manage their symptoms through the use of over-the-counter products containing aspirin, acetaminophen, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	However, an analysis of IMS data (period 2008-2014) indicates that approximately 10 million prescriptions for medications intended to treat non-migraine headaches are issued each year in the U.S., a figure that excludes prescriptions for NSAIDs, indicating that many people who suffer from ETTH seek prescription options.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	All of the products that are FDA-approved for the treatment of ETTH contain butalbital, a barbiturate that is a Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule III substance.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Due to its potential for addiction and abuse, extended use of butalbital is not recommended, and this agent is banned in several European countries.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Although butalbital-containing products may have initial therapeutic value in treating the primary headache condition, they pose a significant risk of inducing analgesic-overuse headache over time due to their tendency for overuse, driven by tolerance and physical and psychological dependence (Young et al, Curr Pain Headache Rep 2002;6:151-155).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	We currently are focused on developing a portfolio of product candidates, including two product candidates in clinical development for registration in three indications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	The following table summarizes our most advanced product candidates, for which we plan to complete the required clinical and nonclinical studies to support their NDA filings:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	TNX-102 SL is a sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	We are developing TNX-102 SL for fibromyalgia and post-traumatic stress disorder.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	In addition to CBP, TNX-102 SL contains excipients, which are well-characterized, are listed in the Inactive Ingredient Guide and are approved for pharmaceutical use.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	TNX-102 SL contains sublingual absorption-enabling ingredients that promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	These include agents that favor a mildly basic salivary pH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	TNX-102 SL contains 2.8 mg of CBP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for chronic use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	TNX-102 SL is a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and we refer to it as a Serotonin and Norepinephrine receptor Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor, or SNARI.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	In FM, pregabalin is believed to exert its clinical benefit primarily by blocking calcium channels, and both duloxetine and milnacipran are believed to exert their clinical benefit mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	In PTSD, both paroxetine and sertraline are believed to exert their clinical benefit primarily by blocking serotonin reuptake.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	As such, TNX-102 SL acts upon cellular receptors that play important roles in the treatment of FM and PTSD, yet also acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for these indications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	CBP is the active ingredient of two products, or CBP products, that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: Flexeril (oral immediate-release tablet, 5 mg and 10 mg dosage forms) and Amrix (oral extended-release capsule, 15 mg and 30 mg dosage forms).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	CBP products are not indicated for the treatment of FM or PTSD, and are approved for acute use (two to three weeks) only.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Immediate-release, or IR, CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Extended-release CBP capsules mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day immediate-release CBP tablets.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	TNX-102 SL is intended for the treatment of chronic disorders for which poor sleep quality is recognized to play an intrinsic role, including FM and PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	We designed TNX-102 SL to be administered once-daily at bedtime in a chronic dosing regimen.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	We believe the dose and pharmacokinetic parameters of TNX-102 SL will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in FM and PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral immediate-release CBP tablets.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	TNX-102 SL was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in these studies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness on the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration, and other side-effects reported were similar to those reported with approved CBP products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	We expect that any applications we submit to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which we believe will allow for a shorter timeline of clinical and non-clinical development as compared to that needed to fulfill the requirements of Section 505(b)(1), under which new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States, are generally developed to meet the FDA s new drug registration requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	Currently, we are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for two separate indications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	These indications are fibromyalgia, for which TNX-102 SL is advancing into Phase 3 development, and post-traumatic stress disorder, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 2 development.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P62_S3	We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to effectively treat these and possibly other CNS indications that are underserved by currently marketed products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM under an effective investigational new drug, or IND, application.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	Our therapeutic approach to FM was initially supported by results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of TNX-102 immediate release capsules, or TNX-102 capsules, which we have also referred to as VLD CBP (Moldofsky et al, J Rheumatol 2011;38:2653-63).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	This study demonstrated significant decreases in pain and other symptoms in subjects treated with TNX-102 capsules daily between dinner and bedtime for eight weeks.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P63_S3	This study also demonstrated that treatment with TNX-102 capsules led to a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality, which we believe relates to the mechanism by which CBP leads to improvement of FM symptoms.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	At an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013, we discussed the design of our clinical program, including the acceptability of the pivotal study design and the proposed registration plan, to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	On the basis of our discussions with the FDA, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	In September 2013, we commenced enrollment of our BESTFIT trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	We reported preliminary top-line results from the BESTFIT trial in September 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	In the BESTFIT trial, 205 patients with FM were randomized at 17 U.S. centers to treatment with either TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	The primary outcome measure of the BESTFIT trial was the mean change in week 12 average daily pain intensity from baseline on the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale, using a daily telephonic diary.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	In the BESTFIT trial, TNX-102 SL did not achieve statistical significance in the primary outcome measure (p=0.172).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S3	However, the trial demonstrated that TNX-102 SL had a statistically significant effect on pain as measured by a 30% responder analysis of the primary pain data (p=0.033), in which a responder is defined as a subject for whom pain intensity was reduced by at least 30% at week 12 as compared to baseline.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S4	The 30% response rate in the final analysis was 34.0% in the active treatment arm as compared to 20.6% in the control arm.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S5	The BESTFIT trial also showed statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL in the declared secondary analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (p=0.025) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised, or FIQ-R (p=0.014).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S6	The study showed statistically significant improvement with TNX-102 SL on measures of sleep quality, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, or PROMIS, Sleep Disturbance instrument (p=0.005).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P66_S7	In addition, statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL were observed on several FIQ-R items (pain, sleep quality, anxiety, stiffness, and sensitivity) as well as on the overall symptom subdomain.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	TNX-102 SL was well tolerated in the BESTFIT trial.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	Among subjects randomized to the active and control arms, 86% and 83%, respectively, completed the 12-week dosing period.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	The most common adverse events were local in nature, with transient tongue or mouth numbness occurring in 42% of participants on TNX-102 SL vs. 1% on placebo, and bitter taste in 8% on TNX-102 SL compared to none on placebo.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	These local adverse events did not appear to affect either rates of retention of study participants or their compliance with taking TNX-102 SL.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	Systemic adverse events were similar between TNX-102 SL and placebo.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	No serious adverse events were reported.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Following our report of the results of the BESTFIT trial, we requested guidance from the FDA on our proposed use of a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint in our prospective Phase 3 clinical trial.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	In January 2015, we announced receipt of the written guidance, whereby the FDA accepted our proposal to use a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint in our Phase 3 trial to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	We expect to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in 500 patients with FM in the second quarter of 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	We expect to report top line results from this trial in the second half of 2016.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	In December 2013, we commenced Study F203, a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL in patients who had completed the BESTFIT trial.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	The goal of Study F203 is to obtain the prerequisite six- and 12-month safety exposure data to support NDA filing for approval for the management of FM, a chronic indication.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	We expect to complete Study F203 in August 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	We expect to conduct a second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL to support product registration.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	We may elect to conduct this trial in Europe to support our plan to seek European Medicines Agency registration for TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Since CBP will be used chronically in TNX-102 SL, we plan to study TNX-102 SL in comparison to IR CBP in a multiple-day dosing (once daily) study.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	The results of this study will provide information regarding blood levels of CBP resulting from use of the marketed IR tablet and our sublingual TNX-102 SL tablet when taken in a multiple day regimen.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P72_S2	We expect the data from this study to serve as a bridge , in that it will allow us to use the IR CBP tablet as the reference product in our submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	We plan to conduct a small study designed to evaluate next morning drowsiness and other cognitive measures following the bedtime use of TNX-102 SL and the bedtime use of CBP products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	The goal of this study is to determine the potential advantages of TNX-102 SL to CBP products on next morning drowsiness and on other cognitive functions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In addition to the clinical studies necessary to support the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA filing for the fibromyalgia indication, the FDA has accepted our proposal on the nonclinical studies to support the NDA filing, since the information from the reference product is either unavailable for reference or failed to meet the current regulatory standard.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	In 2014, we completed dose-ranging studies to identify the doses requested by the FDA for the chronic toxicity studies to improve the existing CBP labeling.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	In January 2015, we engaged an FDA-certified Good Laboratory Practices laboratory to conduct a six month repeated-dose toxicology study of TNX-102 SL in rats, a nine month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs and a peri- and post-natal Segment II study required for the NDA filing.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P74_S3	These studies will be performed concurrently with our Phase 3 studies and will be completed ahead of the NDA submission.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Based on the Flexeril labeling and post-marketing surveillance information, there is no evidence of abuse for CBP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	As a result, the FDA has advised we will not have to assess the abuse potential of TNX-102 SL for the NDA submission.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	The TNX-102 SL drug product manufactured for our BESTFIT study was manufactured in a small-scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	For Phase 3 trials and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	The product s comparability will be supported by the bioequivalence results from the multiple-dose bridging study, if necessary.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	We have submitted a Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, which contains a partial waiver of the requirement to submit pediatric assessments of TNX-102 SL per Section 505B(a)(4)(A)(i) of the FDCA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	Final PSP requirement will be determined at the time of NDA approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Based our discussions with the FDA and the FDA formal meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or a cardiovascular safety study to support the NDA filing.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for FM, the FDA requests no risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	We expect to register TNX-102 SL with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	This regulatory pathway may help to accelerate product development and reduce overall business risk.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	The 505(b)(2)-based product development plan for TNX-102 SL is designed to leverage the safety data that have been generated by other manufacturers for CBP-containing products and accepted by the FDA in support of their product registrations, in addition to the safety data we generate.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	TNX-102 SL contains significantly less CBP than other marketed products that contain CBP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	We believe that the safety data package from these products and the CBP prescriptions utilization database analyzed by IMS Health Incorporated will provide adequate safety margin to support TNX-102 SL development.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P80_S3	At our End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting we held with the FDA in February 2013, we discussed the nature and extent of the clinical trials we need to conduct in order to receive regulatory acceptance of our proposed NDA plan for TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	If NDA approval of TNX-102 SL is granted, in addition to the three-year marketing exclusivity provided by law, we expect this product to be protected by patents that extend through at least 2021, during which time it should not be subject to generic substitution.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	We plan to continue to support the TNX-102 SL program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and in FM patients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	For example, we have recently filed patent applications on TNX-102 SL which, if issued, would be expected to provide protection from generic substitution until at least 2033.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD under a separate IND allowed by the FDA in June 2014, and we are currently conducting our AtEase trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in military-related PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	The clinical presentations of FM and PTSD share a number of similarities and clinical overlap.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	For example, in a survey of males with PTSD or major depression, 49% of PTSD patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM compared to 5% of major depression patients (Amital et al, J Psychosom Res 2006;61:663-669).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	Conversely, in a different survey of FM patients, 57% of the patients had symptoms associated with PTSD (Cohen et al, Semin Arthritis Rheum 2002;32:38-50).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	As with FM, a core feature of PTSD is sleep disturbance.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Sleep disturbances are believed to exacerbate daytime symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, poor concentration, and diminished interest in significant activities.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	The sleep disturbances of PTSD, which include nightmares and night terrors, may be more pronounced than those typically experienced by FM patients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our rationale for developing TNX-102 SL for treatment of PTSD derives from the following:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	In research from peer-reviewed scientific publications, we have identified a number of compounds that are antagonists of the serotonin 2A or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that have been shown to have beneficial effects in treating PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Therefore, it is our belief that TNX-102 SL, a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, will have a therapeutic effect in treating PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	In January 2015, we commenced the AtEase trial, a 220-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 trial of TNX-102 SL in subjects with military-related PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	This trial will be conducted at approximately 25 U.S. centers.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	The AtEase trial is designed to study the efficacy and safety of two doses of TNX-102 SL (2.8 mg and 5.6 mg) administered once daily at bedtime.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	The primary objective of the AtEase trial is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg as compared to placebo sublingual tablet following eight weeks of treatment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	If the results of the AtEase trial are positive, we intend to meet with the FDA to finalize the design of the registration program that would be required to support approval of an NDA for this indication.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	Based on our communications with the FDA to date, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	If we achieve our primary outcome measure in the AtEase study, it could qualify as one of the two studies required to support the NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P89_S3	We expect that we can use the long-term safety exposure data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM to supplement the long-term safety exposure data required for the PTSD NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The approvals by the FDA of Paxil and Zoloft for treating PTSD established a regulatory approval pathway for symptom reduction in PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	We believe our clinical development program of TNX-102 SL and the long term safety data generated from the TNX-102 SL NDA for FM will result in a differentiated product suitable for chronic use for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	We believe that our ongoing and planned clinical trials in PTSD, if successful, will provide sufficient evidence of clinical efficacy and safety to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	We plan to meet with the FDA when we complete the AtEase study to further discuss our development plan for TNX-102 SL for PTSD, especially the proposed design of the pivotal studies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	If the results from the AtEase study are positive, we plan to seek a Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is a new and uncertain process, in which the majority of requests for designation have been denied.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Given TNX-102 SL s pharmacological mode of action, its ability to significantly improve sleep quality as demonstrated in the BESTFIT trial, and the lack of Drug Enforcement Agency scheduling of CBP, we believe TNX-102 SL, if approved, has the potential to serve as an important and differentiated new option for the management of PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	We are developing TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH under an IND cleared by the FDA in October 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	TNX-201 is an oral formulation of (R)-isometheptene mucate, a single isomer of isometheptene mucate, or IMH, which we are developing for episodic tension-type headache.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	We own all rights to TNX-201 in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	Although currently not approved for any indication, IMH has an extensive history of use as a prescription pharmaceutical in the U.S. as a racemic mixture, which consists of two mirror-image isomers, or IMH enantiomers.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	Racemic IMH has been marketed as Octin for conditions including tension and vascular headache.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P94_S2	In addition, racemic IMH has been marketed in combination products for the relief of tension and vascular headaches (examples include Midrin , MigraTen and Prodrin ).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	Between 1990 and 1998, Midrin was the second most-widely prescribed headache medication in the U.S. (Gibbs et al, Headache 2003;43:330-335).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Products containing IMH were first commercialized in the U.S. between 1938 and 1962.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	As introduced in 1938, the FDCA required that new drugs be approved for evidence of safety, with no requirement for evidence of efficacy.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA to require substantial evidence of efficacy, as well as safety, for a drug to be granted FDA approval, and at that time the FDA introduced the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation program, or DESI, to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs approved between 1938 and 1962.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P97_S2	Under the DESI, products containing IMH are currently sanctioned from marketing by the FDA, although certain combination drug products containing IMH remain on the market in the Unapproved Drug Other category.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Based on our evaluation studies, we believe that (R)-isometheptene mucate, which we are developing as TNX-201, is primarily responsible for the efficacy associated with racemic IMH in the treatment of headache, and that (S)-isometheptene mucate, the other IMH enantiomer, may be associated with toxic or undesirable pharmacologic effects.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	As a result, we believe that TNX-201 may possess an improved clinical profile as compared to the unapproved, but previously marketed, racemic IMH for headache indications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	According to the FDA s Stereoisomeric Drugs Development Policy, the development of a single enantiomer of a racemic drug is particularly desirable in cases in which one enantiomer has a toxic or undesirable pharmacologic effect and the other does not.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	Preclinical studies conducted under our direction have shown that TNX-201 significantly increases the pain threshold in standard animal models of acute pain response.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	These studies have also shown that TNX-201 strongly and selectively binds to receptors in the CNS known as imidazoline type-1 (I1) receptors, where it acts as a receptor agonist.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	In January 2014, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the regulatory pathway for the development of TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	We have completed a comparative Phase 1 single ascending dose safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of TNX-201 in 45 healthy volunteers, from which we reported top line results in January 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P101_S2	The clinical results showed that TNX-201 was well-tolerated at all doses studied (35 mg, 70 mg, and 140 mg), and pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated dose-proportionality of parameters including area under the curve and maximum concentration.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P101_S3	The absence of any appreciable amount of (S)-isometheptene in TNX-201 study samples indicated the lack of conversion of (R)-isometheptene to the other enantiomer, a finding which supports the rationale of developing TNX-201, a single isomer of IMH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are preparing to commence a 200-patient Phase 2 study in ETTH in the second quarter of 2015, in which patients will be randomized at approximately 10 U.S. centers to receive TNX-201 140 mg (4 x 35 mg) or placebo capsules.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P102_S1	The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the two study arms in the number of subjects who report complete relief from their headache pain at two hours following a dose of study medication.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P102_S2	We expect to report top line results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	Although the clinical development of TNX-201 can be accelerated based on the available information on racemic IMH, approval of any NDA will be as a new chemical entity pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	We are developing TNX-201 with the goal of introducing a safe, effective, and non-addictive treatment option for ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed dose combination drug product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P106_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for alcohol abuse and dependence, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P106_S2	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on two biodefense technologies: one relating to the development of novel smallpox vaccines; and the other to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P106_S3	We have begun non-clinical research and development on these programs.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	The FDA Animal Efficacy Rule provides a mechanism for product licensure when human efficacy studies are not feasible or ethical.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	As a result, the licensure of these biodefense products in the U.S. may not require human efficacy studies, which we believe will reduce our development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S5	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S6	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P108_S7	Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	The markets for medicines to treat FM, PTSD, ETTH and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P109_S1	Eli Lilly (Cymbalta), Forest Laboratories (Savella), and Pfizer (Lyrica) market FDA approved drugs for FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P109_S2	Cymbalta lost its U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil) and Pfizer (Zoloft) market FDA approved drugs for PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	Medications that are FDA approved for ETTH include Fiorinal, Fiorinal with Codeine, Fioricet, and their generic equivalents.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P111_S1	Non-prescription medications used for ETTH include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen and naproxen; acetaminophen; and aspirin.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	A number of companies are developing prescription medications for FM, including Allergan, Daiichi Sankyo, Meda, Merck, Pfizer, RiboCor and Theravance.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P112_S1	Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of FM include gabapentin; anti-depressants, such as amitriptyline, venlafaxine, and trazodone; muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine; tramadol; opioids; and benzodiazepine, as well as non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	A number of companies are developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Actavis, Johnson and Johnson, Lundbeck, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Otsuka, and Pfizer.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P114_S1	Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of PTSD include anti-depressants, such as nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; and certain atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and risperidone.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	A number of companies are developing prescription medications for ETTH, including Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of ETTH include simple and combination analgesics, which may include opioids, anti-depressants, such as amitriptyline, and drugs approved for the treatment of migraine, such as sumatriptan.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P117_S2	As of February 23, 2015, we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to five issued U.S. patents and 10 issued non-U.S. patents covering 26 jurisdictions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P117_S3	We are actively pursuing an additional 16 U.S. patent applications, of which six are provisional and 10 are non-provisional, three international patent applications, and 36 non-U.S./non-international patent applications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P118_S0	We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P118_S1	We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P118_S2	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P119_S0	Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P119_S1	We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P120_S0	We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P120_S1	For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P121_S0	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P121_S1	In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P122_S0	In the United States, a patent s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P123_S0	The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P123_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P123_S2	The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P123_S3	A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P123_S4	Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P123_S5	When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P124_S0	The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our three most advanced product candidates as of February 23, 2015 are summarized below.

1430306_15_ITEM1_P125_S2	U.S. Patent Nos. 6,541,523, 6,395,788 and 6,358,944 are expected to expire in 2020, unless they are eligible for patent term extensions on the basis of FDA approvals.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	The unique pharmacokinetic profile of TNX-102 SL was discovered by Tonix and its development partners and is termed the PK Technology.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P126_S1	The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the PK Technology includes patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing CBP, CBP formulations, and methods for treating FM and other CNS conditions utilizing CBP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P126_S2	The PK Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 13/918,692.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P126_S3	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2033, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	Certain eutectic compositions were discovered by development partners and are termed the Eutectic Technology.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P127_S1	The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the Eutectic Technology includes patent applications directed to eutectic compositions containing CBP, eutectic CBP formulations, methods for treating FM and other CNS conditions utilizing eutectic CBP compositions, and methods of manufacturing eutectic CBP compositions.

1430306_15_ITEM1_P127_S3	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	Our patent portfolio for TNX-201, relating to isometheptene isomers and termed the Isometheptene Technology , includes patent applications directed to a purified isomer of isometheptene, pharmaceutical compositions containing isometheptene, isometheptene formulations, methods for modulating headache and other CNS conditions and treating CNS conditions utilizing isometheptene isomers, and methods of manufacturing isometheptene isomers.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P128_S1	The Isometheptene Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 14/158,735 as well as U.S. Provisional Patent Application No 61/953,715.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P128_S2	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	Our patent portfolio for disulfiram and selegiline combinations includes patents and patent applications.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P129_S1	It includes claims directed to disulfiram and selegiline, pharmaceutical compositions containing disulfiram and selegiline, disulfiram and selegiline formulations, methods of treating an alcohol use disorder, and methods of modulating alcohol abuse and dependence.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P129_S2	It includes issued U.S. Patent Nos. 8,093,300 and 8,481,599.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P129_S3	The patent expiring last is expected to expire in 2024, excluding any patent term extensions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	In March 2014, we acquired the rights to develop two additional biodefense technologies: a new drug candidate that potentially protects humans from certain effects of radiation and a new vaccine candidate against smallpox.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P130_S1	With respect to the radioprotection drug candidate, we acquired U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,203,733 and related intellectual property rights.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	The radio- and chemo-protective technology relates to proprietary forms of a small molecular pharmaceutical agent, which is believed to protect against ionizing radiation after oral administration.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	With respect to the smallpox vaccine candidate, we acquired U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,207,727 and related intellectual property rights.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	The smallpox vaccine technology relates to proprietary forms of live vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P132_S2	We believe that these technologies, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P133_S1	For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S2	These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S3	We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S4	While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S5	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P134_S6	To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	Our current patents owned are as follows:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, U.K.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P137_S0	Our current pending patent applications are as follows:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P138_S0	We seek trademark and service mark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P138_S1	On December 16, 2014, we received U.S. registration number 4,656,463 as a service mark for Tonix Pharmaceuticals in the United States.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P139_S0	We have eight employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P139_S1	We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase several fold as we advance TNX-102 SL into late-stage clinical development and advance other candidates in our pipeline.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P139_S2	We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P139_S3	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY and San Jose, CA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P139_S4	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P140_S0	We have contracted with third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P140_S1	For TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P141_S0	All of our compounds are small molecules, synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P142_S0	The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P142_S1	These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P142_S2	The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P142_S3	Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P143_S1	The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P146_S2	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator s brochure.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P147_S1	An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P147_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P147_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P148_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P148_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P149_S1	Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P153_S1	Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P154_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease, but sometimes can include several thousand patients.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P154_S2	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P155_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P155_S2	Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P155_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P156_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P157_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P158_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S1	We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S2	Although the clinical development of TNX-201 can be accelerated due to existing marketing experience, we expect to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for TNX-201 and for certain other products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S3	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S4	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S5	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P159_S6	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P160_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P160_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P161_S0	Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P161_S1	As such, we plan to submit NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P161_S2	The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for FM or PTSD as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P161_S3	If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P161_S4	If the FDA requires full NDAs for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P161_S5	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P162_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P162_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed by the FDA for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P162_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P162_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P163_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P164_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P164_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P165_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_15_ITEM1_P165_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P166_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P166_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P166_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P167_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P168_S0	The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P168_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P168_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P168_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P168_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P169_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P170_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P170_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P170_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P170_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P170_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P171_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P171_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P172_S0	On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P172_S1	FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation Breakthrough Therapy.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P172_S2	A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P173_S0	preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P174_S0	If a drug is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P174_S1	In the event that our AtEase study of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is successful, we will request Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P174_S2	The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is relatively new, and the majority of requests for designation have been denied.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P174_S3	We cannot predict the likelihood of success in seeking Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P175_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P175_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P175_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P175_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P175_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_15_ITEM1_P176_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P177_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P177_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P178_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P179_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P179_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P179_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P180_S0	In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, became law.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P180_S1	This legislation grants significant new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P180_S2	In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information, and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P180_S3	In addition, the new law significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P180_S4	Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P181_S0	The FDA has not yet implemented many of the provisions of the FDAAA, so we cannot predict the impact of the new legislation on the pharmaceutical industry or our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P181_S1	However, the requirements and changes imposed by the FDAAA may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P181_S2	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P181_S3	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P182_S0	As of February 27, 2015, we had 16 full-time employees, of whom seven hold M.D., PharmD. and/or Ph.D. degrees.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P182_S1	We have eight employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P182_S2	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY and San Jose, CA.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P182_S3	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies as well as part-time employees.
1430306_15_ITEM1_P183_S0	None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company and its prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of products that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, development and laboratory testing and clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We cannot assure you that we will ever have a product approved by the FDA, that we will bring any product to market or, if we are successful in doing so, that we will ever become profitable.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, pre-clinical testing, and clinical trial activities increase.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our operations to date have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our clinical-stage product candidates, TNX-102 SL and TNX-201.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL, TNX-201 or any of our other product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or commercialized products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial condition has varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include other factors described elsewhere in this annual report and also include:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance policies.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Accordingly, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have no approved products on the market and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our clinical-stage product candidates, TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, and we cannot be certain that these product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We currently have two product candidates in clinical stages of development for three indications: TNX-102 SL for the management of FM and PTSD, and TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH, and the success of our business currently depends on their successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of TNX-102 SL and TNX-201.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 have not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for these product candidates anywhere in the world.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The clinical development programs for TNX-102 SL and TNX-201 may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that these product candidates are safe and effective or a clinical program may be put on hold due to unexpected safety issues.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL or TNX-201 in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because we have limited financial and human resources, we are currently focusing on the regulatory approvals of TNX-102 SL and TNX-201.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our spending on existing and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and clinical trials and marketing activities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next twelve months.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to commence clinical trials or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors' products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents on products we develop.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the PTO ) and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our success depends on our patents, patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine the priority of inventions.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, PTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Also, a third party may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	An adverse decision in litigation could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Interference proceedings brought before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to our patents or patent applications.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	During an interference proceeding, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Even if successful, an interference proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If preclinical testing or clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including CROs and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical testing or clinical trials involving our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical testing or clinical trials than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical testing or clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical trials, consistent with a clinical trial protocol.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Delays in preclinical and clinical testing could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Once a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If clinical trials are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	While we have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We will control only certain aspects of our CROs activities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that our clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA s current good clinical practices requirements, or cGCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with cGCPs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In addition, our clinical trials, including our planned Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM, will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, our clinical trials may be delayed or we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our CROs are not our employees, and we are not able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for such product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for our clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have never conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial or submitted an NDA before, and may be unable to do so for TNX-102 SL or other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If our planned Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM is successful, we then expect to conduct a second Phase 3 confirmatory study in support of product registration.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As these trials are intended to provide evidence to support marketing approval by the FDA, they are considered pivotal trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The conduct of pivotal clinical trials and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Although members of our management team have extensive industry experience, including in the development, clinical testing and commercialization of drug candidates, our company has never conducted a pivotal clinical trial before, has limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings, and has not submitted an NDA before.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete these planned clinical trials in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials would prevent or delay commercialization of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing .
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Our product candidates may cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects from TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The results of future clinical trials, including TNX-102 SL, may show that our product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	If we are unable to file for approval of TNX 102-SL under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore possibly obtain a shortened review period for the applications.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	We held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in February 2013 to discuss our most advanced development program, in which we are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In late 2014, following the results of the BESTFIT trial, we corresponded with the FDA to further discuss our Phase 3 registration program plan.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S3	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012 to discuss the development of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Although our interactions with the FDA have encouraged our efforts to continue to develop TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, there is no assurance that we will satisfy the FDA s requirements for approval in these indications.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S5	The timeline for filing and review of our NDAs for TNX-102 SL is based on our plan to submit those NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which would enable us to rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P70_S6	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S7	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P71_S8	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications for TNX-102 SL, and the FDA may not agree that any of our products qualify for marketing approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL, and we may need to fulfill the more extensive requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We will need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	As we advance our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials and develop new product candidates, we will need to increase our product development, scientific and administrative headcount to manage these programs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	In addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	continue to improve our operational, manufacturing, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Loss of the services of Dr. Lederman would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P78_S3	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P79_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P79_S4	Moreover, competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in drug development, product registration, clinical and non-clinical research, quality compliance, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our trials, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We intend to rely on CMOs to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical trials and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates requires the manufacture of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P83_S3	We have contracted with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds, including TNX-102 SL.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P83_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P83_S5	Although we are in discussions with other manufacturers we have identified as potential alternative CMOs of TNX-102 SL, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms with any of them.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with many of these manufacturers.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P84_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for cGMP compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P87_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P88_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P88_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P91_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P93_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P95_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct adequate and well controlled clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P100_S3	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P100_S4	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P100_S5	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials; the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our clinical trials may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our product candidates are expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P102_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our products in clinical development.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P103_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P105_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to an NDA under the FDCA.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P105_S3	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P105_S4	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P106_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P106_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P106_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P106_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Following completion of clinical trials, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P110_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P110_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs - six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P110_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P110_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA is approved.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P112_S1	None of our product candidates have been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P115_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P115_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P115_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P116_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P118_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P119_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P120_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P121_S1	Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P121_S3	If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P123_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Our strategy with our product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S4	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S5	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P124_S6	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P125_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P125_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P128_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P128_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P128_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P129_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P129_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P129_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P129_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P129_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P129_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P130_S0	In the event that we are successful in bringing any products to market, our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products successfully may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P132_S0	other third party payors, including Medicare.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P133_S0	We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for health care products to be approved in the future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P133_S3	Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P134_S0	The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P134_S1	If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any prescription product we bring to market, doctors may not prescribe them or patients may ask to have their physicians prescribe competing drugs with more favorable reimbursement.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P135_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P135_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P135_S2	In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P135_S3	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P135_S4	Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P136_S0	If we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P137_S0	If TNX-102 SL, TNX-201 or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercialization outside of the United States, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P137_S1	We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P138_S0	difficulty in importing and exporting clinical trial materials and study samples.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators' drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S3	While we currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S4	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S5	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S6	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators' products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P140_S7	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P141_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P142_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P142_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P143_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P143_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P144_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P144_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P144_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P145_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P145_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P146_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P147_S0	Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We carry insurance for most categories of risk that our business may encounter, however, we may not have adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P148_S1	We currently maintain general liability, clinical trial, key man, property, workers compensation, products liability and directors and officers insurance, along with an umbrella policy, which collectively costs approximately $200,000 per annum.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P148_S2	We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to maintain existing insurance at current or adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P148_S3	Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P149_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P150_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Sales of additional shares of our common stock, including by us or our directors and officers following expiration or early release of the lock-up periods, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, by us or others, including the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P152_S1	In connection with a public offering in February 2015, we and our directors and officers have entered into lock-up agreements for 90 days following such offering (which period may be extended under certain circumstances).
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P152_S2	We and our directors and officers may be released from lock-up prior to the expiration of the lock-up periods at the sole discretion of Roth Capital Partners, LLC and Oppenheimer Co., Inc.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Upon expiration or earlier release of the lock-up, we and our directors and officers may sell shares into the market, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P154_S0	The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P155_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P155_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P155_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P156_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P157_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P158_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P158_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P159_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P160_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P160_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P160_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P160_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P160_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P161_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P162_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P162_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P162_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P164_S0	The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P165_S0	Our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P165_S1	As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P165_S2	Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P166_S0	The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P167_S0	Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create a series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Efforts to comply with recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and require additional management resources, and we still may fail to comply.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P169_S0	As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. As a result of our public float at June 30, 2014, effective January 1, 2015, we transitioned from a smaller reporting company to an accelerated filer.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P169_S1	As a result, for the first time, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements attested to and opined on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in their report included in this 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P170_S0	If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P171_S0	Because certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P172_S0	As of February 24, 2015, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (those beneficially owning in excess of 5%), and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 30.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P172_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P172_S2	In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P172_S3	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P173_S0	discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P174_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P175_S0	The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P175_S1	Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P175_S2	Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
1430306_15_ITEM1A_P175_S3	If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1430306_15_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments at December 31, 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	On February 11, 2014, we entered into a lease amendment and expansion agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises for office space, commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	In connection therewith, the original letter of credit was increased by $72,354 to $132,417 and we deposited an additional $72,354 into the restricted cash account maintained at the bank that issued the letter of credit.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Including the additional premises, the total square footage of our principal office space is approximately 4,800.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	On April 28, 2014, we entered into a lease for approximately 3,578 square feet of office space in San Jose, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2014 and expiring on October 31, 2018 (51 months).
1430306_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $44,546.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	Future minimum lease payments under these two agreements are as follows:
1430306_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	Additionally, we rent a small office in Ireland on a month-to-month basis.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P5_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current business requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM2_P5_S1	We maintain websites at www.tonixpharma.com and www.krele.com and the information contained on those websites is not deemed to be a part of this annual report.
1430306_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1430306_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol TNXP since August 11, 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Previous to that date, our common stock was listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	Prior to August 9, 2013, our common stock was traded on the OTCQB under the symbol TNXP.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	On February 24, 2015, the closing sale price of our common stock, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, was $6.10 per share.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	On February 24, 2015, there were 237 holders of record of our common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table summarizes information about our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	On October 1, 2014, we issued 37,647 shares of common stock to one investor upon the exercise of Warrants for proceeds of $160,000.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	The shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	On December 17, 2014, we issued 3,530 shares of common stock to our Chief Financial Officer upon the exercise of Warrants for proceeds of $15,003.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P6_S1	The shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	On December 18, 2014, we issued 30,000 shares of common stock to one of our Directors upon the exercise of Warrants for proceeds of $127,500.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P7_S1	The shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1430306_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	We did not purchase any of our registered securities during the period covered by this Annual Report.
1430306_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may will, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and continue, or similar words.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P1_S5	Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company s services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel prescription products for common yet challenging medical disorders.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our clinical-stage product candidates, TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, are directed toward conditions affecting the CNS.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	In the second quarter of 2015, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of our most advanced candidate, TNX-102 SL, for the treatment of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	We are also developing TNX-102 SL as a potential treatment for PTSD, and we commenced a Phase 2 trial for this indication in January 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	We expect to begin a Phase 2 trial of TNX-201 in ETTH in the second quarter of 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	Our pipeline includes a preclinical program for the treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence as well as two preclinical biodefense programs (protection from smallpox virus and from radiation injury).
1430306_15_ITEM7_P2_S6	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our therapeutic strategy in FM is supported by results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b BESTFIT trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although the BESTFIT trial demonstrated only a positive trend and did not achieve statistical significance for TNX-102 SL in the primary efficacy analysis of change in mean pain intensity at week 12, it demonstrated statistical significance (p 0.05) in a 30% responder analysis of the primary pain data, a declared secondary endpoint in which a responder is defined as a subject for whom pain intensity was reduced by at least 30% at week 12 as compared to baseline.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	The BESTFIT trial also showed statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL in the declared secondary analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (p 0.05) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised, or FIQ-R (p 0.05).
1430306_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	In addition, the study showed statistically significant improvement with TNX-102 SL on measures of sleep quality as well as on several FIQ-R items.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	TNX-102 SL was well tolerated in the BESTFIT trial, and the most common adverse events were local in nature, with transient tongue or mouth numbness occurring in 42% of participants on TNX-102 SL vs. 1% on placebo, and bitter taste in 8% on TNX-102 SL compared to none on placebo.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	These local adverse events did not appear to affect either rates of retention of study participants or their compliance with taking TNX-102 SL.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Systemic adverse events were similar between TNX-102 SL and placebo.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	No serious adverse events were reported.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Among subjects randomized to the active and control arms, 86% and 83%, respectively, completed the 12-week dosing period.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are conducting a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL, into which patients who completed the BESTFIT study were eligible to enroll.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	On the basis of our discussions with the FDA, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Following the BESTFIT study, we received written guidance from the FDA which accepted our proposal to use a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint in our Phase 3 program to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	We expect to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in 500 patients with FM in the second quarter of 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	We expect to report top line results from this trial in the second half of 2016.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are evaluating TNX-102 SL for the treatment of military-related PTSD in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 AtEase study, from which we expect to report initial results in the first half of 2016.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The primary objective of the AtEase trial is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg as compared to placebo sublingual tablet following eight weeks of treatment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Based on our communications with the FDA to date, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	If we achieve our primary outcome measure in the AtEase study, it could qualify as one of the two studies required to support the NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	We expect that we can use the data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM to supplement the long-term safety exposure data required for the PTSD NDA.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	We are developing TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We are preparing to commence a 200-patient Phase 2 study in ETTH in the second quarter of 2015, in which patients will be randomized at approximately 10 U.S. centers to receive TNX-201 140 mg (4 x 35 mg) or placebo capsules.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the two study arms in the number of subjects who report complete relief from their headache pain at two hours following a dose of study medication.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	We expect to report top line results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Although the clinical development of TNX-201 can be accelerated based on available information on the active ingredient of TNX-201, approval of any NDA will be as a new chemical entity pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed dose CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for alcohol abuse and dependence, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on two biodefense technologies: one relating to the development of novel smallpox vaccines; and the other to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	We have begun non-clinical research and development on these programs.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The FDA Animal Efficacy Rule provides a mechanism for product licensure when human efficacy studies are not feasible or ethical.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	As a result, the licensure of these biodefense products in the U.S. may not require human efficacy studies, which we believe will reduce our development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, but we also expend increasing effort on our other pipeline programs, including TNX-301.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing work and the cost of drug ingredients used in such work, fees paid to consultants for work related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy and safety of our drugs.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	In the second quarter of 2015, we plan to begin both a Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM as well as a Phase 2 trial of TNX-201 in ETTH.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Clinical trials can be very expensive.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	If these and additional necessary clinical trials are successful, we plan to prepare and submit applications to the FDA for marketing approval for our drug candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result of these and other factors, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next 12 to 24 months.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	We expect that all of our research and development expenses in the near-term future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected patient recruitment, or government delays.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold .

1430306_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	The increase is due to additional work required in 2014 related to Sarbanes Oxley as well additional audit and accounting fees related to our additional subsidiaries.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	Investor and public relations fees totaled $874 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $219 or 33%, from $655 incurred in fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P25_S6	The increase is due to expenses incurred during our annual analyst day as well as costs incurred related to brand awareness and drug name development.

1430306_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	The increase is mainly due to updated company materials presented updated at investor relations events.

1430306_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	A significant portion of the accounts payable and accrued expenses are due to work performed in relation to our ongoing clinical trials of TNX-102 SL in FM and PTSD.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we used approximately $22,840 and $8,517 of cash in operating activities, respectively, which represents cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	Increases in cash outlays principally resulted from manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical cost and activities, regulatory cost, and payroll.

1430306_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	We believe our existing cash is sufficient to fund our operating expenses and planned clinical trials for at least the next 12 months.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	We presently do not have any available credit, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Due to our history and historical operating losses, our operations have not been a source of liquidity.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	We may need to obtain additional capital in order to fund future research and development activities.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P41_S5	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

1430306_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	On June 9, 2014, we approved the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holdings Corp. 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2014 ESPP ).
1430306_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The 2014 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Under the 2014 ESPP, on the first day of each offering period, each eligible employee for that offering period has the option to enroll for that offering period, which allows the eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at the end of the offering period.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	Each offering period under the 2014 ESPP is for six months, which can be modified from time-to-time.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	Subject to limitations, each participant will be permitted to purchase a number of shares determined by dividing the employee s accumulated payroll deductions for the offering period by the applicable purchase price, which is equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is less.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P55_S5	A participant must designate in his or her enrollment package the percentage (if any) of compensation to be deducted during that offering period for the purchase of stock under the 2014 ESPP, subject to the statutory limit under the Code.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	As of December 31, 2014, after giving effect to shares purchased as described below, there were 286,022 shares available for future purchase under the 2014 ESPP.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The 2014 ESPP is considered a compensatory plan with the related compensation cost written off over the six month offering period.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2014, approximately $91 of employee payroll deductions which have been withheld since July 1, 2014, the commencement of the offering period are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	The compensation expense related to the 2014 ESPP for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $35.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	In February 2015, 13,978 shares that were purchased as of December 31, 2014, were issued under the 2014 ESPP.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	On February 11, 2014, in connection with office space in New York City, we entered into a lease amendment and expansion agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises for office space, commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	In connection therewith, the original letter of credit was increased by $72 to $133 and we deposited an additional $72 into the restricted cash account maintained at the bank that issued the letter of credit.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	On April 28, 2014, we entered into a lease for approximately 3,578 square feet of office space in San Jose, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2014 and expiring on October 31, 2018 (51 months).
1430306_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $45.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Future minimum lease payments under these two agreements are as follows:
1430306_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Additionally, we rent a small office in Ireland on a month-to-month basis.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P62_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Tonix outsources its research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company records an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation , which was issued in June 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 (and interim periods therein), with early adoption allowed.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The amendments in this ASU eliminate the concept of a development stage entity from GAAP and remove the related incremental financial reporting requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	Accordingly, we elected early adoption and are no longer presenting cumulative inception-to-date along with our current period amounts in our statements of operations and cash flows.
1430306_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	There were various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of securities issued by the U.S. government, deposits, and money market deposits managed by commercial banks.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $38.2 million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the United States.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term money marketable funds.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the relatively low risk profile of our investments, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a 1% movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We do not hold any foreign currency denominated financial instruments.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs.
1430306_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We do not believe that inflation and changing prices during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 had a significant impact on our results of operations.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1430306_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	On October 24, 2013, Tonix Sub formed Tonix Pharmaceuticals (Barbados), Ltd.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	Tonix Barbados had previously entered into a license agreement and a cost-sharing agreement with Tonix Sub, pursuant to which Tonix Barbados acquired the rights to develop and commercialize certain products (TNX-102 SL and TNX-201) for non-US markets.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P7_S2	In the first quarter of 2015, Tonix Barbados is expected to be dissolved and its assets are to be transferred to Tonix International Holding.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	On April 23, 2013, Tonix Sub formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Tonix Pharmaceuticals (Canada), Inc.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	( Tonix Canada ), in the province of New Brunswick, Canada for the purpose of obtaining research and development credits from the Canadian government for any research and development studies performed in Canada.

1430306_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Krele is a limited liability corporation whose sole member is Tonix Pharmaceuticals Inc.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	Krele was established to commercialize products that are generic versions of predicate new drug application products or versions of drug efficacy study implementation products.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. expects that its relationship to Krele will be similar to that of several other pharmaceutical companies and their subsidiaries that market generic versions of the parent's branded products at different periods in their product life-cycle.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries referred to in Note 1 (hereafter referred to as the Company or Tonix ).
1430306_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation , which was issued in June 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 (and interim periods therein), with early adoption allowed.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	The amendments in this ASU eliminate the concept of a development stage entity from GAAP and remove the related incremental financial reporting requirements.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	Accordingly, the Company elected early adoption and is no longer presenting cumulative inception-to-date along with their current period amounts in its statements of operations and cash flows.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company's primary efforts are devoted to conducting research and development for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Further, the Company does not have any commercial products available for sale and has not generated revenues and there is no assurance that if approval of their products is received that the Company will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had working capital of $35,655,643, after raising $47,836,469 through the sale of common stock and $5,660,622 upon the exercise of previously issued warrants during 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	In addition, the Company raised approximately $29,000,000 in February 2015 through the sale of common stock (see Note 12).
1430306_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	Management believes that the Company has sufficient funds to meet its research and development and other funding requirements for at least the next 12 months.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company expects that cash used in operations for research and development will increase significantly over the next several years.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P15_S4	In the event the funding obtained is not sufficient to complete the development and commercialization of its current product candidates, the Company intends to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P15_S5	If the Company is unsuccessful in raising additional financing, it will need to reduce costs and operations in the future.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	Significant estimates include the useful life of fixed assets, assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation and other equity instruments, and the percent of completion of research and development contracts.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company outsources its research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, as well as licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired is expensed as research and development costs, as such property related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses (see note 11).
1430306_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life, which is three years for computer assets, five years for furniture and all other equipment and term of lease for lease improvements.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.

1430306_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits.

1430306_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	Translation adjustments resulting from this process, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet.

1430306_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	Other comprehensive income (loss) represents foreign currency translation adjustments.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss, by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock, adjusted to give effect to the 20-for-1 reverse stock split, which was effected on May 1, 2013 (see Note 6).

1430306_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	In computing diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, no effect has been given to such options and warrants as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
1430306_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Property and equipment as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 is summarized as follows:
1430306_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $35,559 and $16,591, respectively.

1430306_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1430306_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by EisnerAmper LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report below.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	We have audited the internal controls over financial reporting of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P9_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	In our opinion, Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
1430306_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1430306_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Tonmya is the proposed trade name for TNX-102 SL for fibromyalgia, or FM, and has been conditionally accepted by the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp., together with its subsidiaries (collectively we, our, us, Tonix or the Company ), is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the invention and development of next-generation medicines.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our most advanced drug development programs are directed toward disorders affecting the central nervous system, or CNS, and include FM and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	These disorders are characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of FM, PTSD and other central nervous system disorders.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) is in Phase 3 clinical development as a potential treatment for FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, TNX-102 SL is in Phase 2 clinical development as a potential treatment for PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	Our nonclinical pipeline includes a development program for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, or AUD, as well as two biodefense development programs for protection from smallpox virus and from radiation injury.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our clinical-stage product candidates are as follows:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, for sublingual administration and transmucosal absorption.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We are developing TNX-102 SL for two indications:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Fibromyalgia is a debilitating syndrome that occurs in five to 15 million U.S. adults and is associated with a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in careers or education.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for FM, or discontinue therapy due to poor tolerability.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Prescription pain and sleep medications not approved for FM are frequently taken for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic effect.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	An estimated 8.4 million adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	TNX-201 is an oral formulation of dexisometheptene mucate that we were developing for episodic tension-type headache, or ETTH.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	On February 16, 2016, we announced that we discontinued development of TNX-20 1 because it lacked efficacy.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	The principal components of our strategy are to:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Develop TNX-102 SL for multiple central nervous system disorders .
1430306_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We currently are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for two separate indications, FM and PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Maximize the commercial potential of TNX-102 SL .
1430306_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	We plan to commercialize TNX-102 SL for indications including FM and PTSD either on our own or through collaboration with partners.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe TNX-102 SL can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates .
1430306_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	In the case of TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	In the case of TNX-102 SL, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates .
1430306_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our product candidates address disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies and represent large potential commercial market opportunities.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Background information on the disorders and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates is set forth below.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	The peak incidence of FM occurs between 20-50 years of age, and 80-90% of diagnosed patients are female.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	FM may have a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in career or education.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	According to published estimates, there are approximately five to fifteen million people suffering from FM in the U.S.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	(Vincent et al, Arthritis Care Res 2013;65:786-792; Lawrence et al, Arthritis Rheum 2008;58:26-35).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Based on our market research, we believe that sales in the U.S. of FDA-approved medications for FM were approximately $1.2 billion in 2014, representing approximately 5.6 million prescriptions.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	According to a report by Frost and Sullivan that we commissioned, despite the availability of approved medications, the majority of patients fail therapy due to either insufficient efficacy or poor tolerability, or both.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Prescription pain and sleep medications are frequently prescribed off-label for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic benefit, and many of these medications carry significant safety risks and risk of dependence.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	PTSD is a chronic syndrome that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	Of those who experience significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S5	As of 2009, there were approximately 500,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P28_S6	Based on March 2014 VHA data, approximately 20% of military personnel involved in recent conflicts were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	The medications currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	We currently are focused on developing a portfolio of product candidates, including one product candidate in clinical development for registration in two indications.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	The following table summarizes our most advanced product candidates, for which we plan to complete the required clinical and nonclinical studies to support their NDA filings:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	TNX-102 SL is a sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	We are developing TNX-102 SL for fibromyalgia and post-traumatic stress disorder.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved for pharmaceutical use.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	TNX-102 SL contains 2.8 mg of CBP.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	TNX-102 SL is a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and we refer to it as a Serotonin and Norepinephrine receptor Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor, or SNARI.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	In FM, pregabalin is believed to exert its clinical benefit primarily by blocking calcium channels, and both duloxetine and milnacipran are believed to exert their clinical benefit mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	In PTSD, both paroxetine and sertraline are believed to exert their clinical benefit primarily by blocking serotonin reuptake.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P34_S3	As such, TNX-102 SL acts upon cellular receptors that play important roles in the treatment of FM and PTSD, including the receptors that mediate serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P34_S4	In addition, TNX-102 SL also acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for these indications, including the serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: FLEXERIL (oral immediate-release tablet, 5 mg and 10 mg dosage forms) and AMRIX (oral extended-release capsule, 15 mg and 30 mg dosage forms).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	FLEXERIL brand of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablet has been discontinued since May 2013.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	There are numerous generic versions of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablets on the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	CBP-containing products are not indicated for the treatment of FM or PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	Immediate-release, or IR, CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day immediate-release CBP tablets.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	We designed TNX-102 SL to be administered once-daily at bedtime and intended for long-term dosing regimen.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	We believe the selected dose of TNX-102 SL and its pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in FM and PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral immediate-release CBP tablets.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	In clinical studies, TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in these studies.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	We expect that any applications we submit to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for product candidates containing an active ingredient that is similar or identical to an already approved product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Currently, we are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for two separate indications.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	These indications are fibromyalgia, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 3 development, and post-traumatic stress disorder, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 2 development.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to provide clinical benefit to these and possibly other CNS indications that are underserved by currently marketed products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM under an effective investigational new drug, or IND, application.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our therapeutic approach to FM was initially supported by results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of TNX-102 immediate release capsules, or TNX-102 capsules, which we have also referred to as VLD CBP (Moldofsky et al, J Rheumatol 2011;38:2653-63).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	This study demonstrated significant decreases in pain and other symptoms in patients treated with TNX-102 capsules daily between dinner and bedtime for eight weeks.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	This study also demonstrated that treatment with TNX-102 capsules led to a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality, which we believe relates to the mechanism by which CBP leads to improvement of FM symptoms.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	At an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013, we discussed the design of our clinical program, including the acceptability of the pivotal study design and the proposed registration plan, to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	On the basis of our discussions with the FDA, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	In September 2013, we commenced enrollment of our BESTFIT trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	We reported preliminary top line results from the BESTFIT trial in September 2014.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	In the BESTFIT trial, 205 patients with FM were randomized at 17 U.S. centers to treatment with either TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	The primary outcome measure of the BESTFIT trial was the mean change in week 12 average daily pain intensity from baseline on the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale, using a daily telephonic diary.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	In the BESTFIT trial, TNX-102 SL did not achieve statistical significance in the primary outcome measure (p=0.172).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	However, the trial demonstrated that TNX-102 SL had a statistically significant effect on pain as measured by a 30% responder analysis of the primary pain data (p=0.033), in which a responder is defined as a subject for whom pain intensity was reduced by at least 30% at week 12 as compared to baseline.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S4	The 30% response rate in the final analysis was 34.0% in the active treatment arm as compared to 20.6% in the control arm.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S5	The BESTFIT trial also showed statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL in the declared secondary analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (p=0.025) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised, or FIQ-R (p=0.014).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S6	The study showed statistically significant improvement with TNX-102 SL on measures of sleep quality, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, or PROMIS, Sleep Disturbance instrument (p=0.005).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P44_S7	In addition, statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL were observed on several FIQ-R items (pain, sleep quality, anxiety, stiffness, and sensitivity) as well as on the overall symptom subdomain.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	TNX-102 SL was well tolerated in the BESTFIT trial.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	Among patients randomized to the active and control arms, 86% and 83%, respectively, completed the 12-week dosing period.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The most common adverse events were local in nature, with transient tongue or mouth numbness occurring in 44% of participants on TNX-102 SL vs. 2% on placebo, and bitter taste in 8% on TNX-102 SL compared to none on placebo.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	These local adverse events did not appear to affect either rates of retention of study participants or their compliance with taking TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	Systemic adverse events were similar between TNX-102 SL and placebo.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P46_S3	No serious adverse events were reported.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Following our report of the results of the BESTFIT trial, we requested guidance from the FDA on our proposed use of a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint in a prospective Phase 3 registration program.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	In January 2015, we announced receipt of the written guidance, whereby the FDA accepted our proposal to use a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	In the second quarter of 2015, we commenced the AFFIRM trial, a 500 patient, randomized, double-blind trial comparing TNX-102 SL to placebo (1:1 ratio), in which study medication is administered sublingually once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	The primary endpoint of the AFFIRM trial is the FDA-agreed upon 30% pain responder analysis.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	We expect to report top line results from the AFFIRM trial in the third quarter of 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	In August 2015, we completed Study F203, a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL in patients who had completed the BESTFIT study.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	The goal of Study F203 was to obtain the prerequisite long-term safety exposure data to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing for TNX-102 SL for the management of FM, a chronic medical condition.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	We believe that we have sufficient long-term exposure data from F203 to support an NDA filing for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We have completed the clinical phase of a Phase 1 bioequivalence pharmacokinetic study (F105) that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of single-doses of TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: the facility used to produce study medication for our Phase 2b BESTFIT study and the facility used to produce study medication for our ongoing Phase 3 AFFIRM study and the to-be-marketed product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	The study demonstrated that the TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at the two different facilities are bioequivalent.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	In the second quarter of 2016, we plan to commence the REAFFIRM trial, a second randomized, double-blind Phase 3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL, to support product registration.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	We currently expect that the size and design of the REAFFIRM trial will be similar to that of the AFFIRM trial.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Patients who successfully complete the AFFIRM or REAFFIRM studies are or will be eligible to enroll into the three-month open label extension study, or Study F303.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Study F303 is designed to capture additional safety and efficacy information after the patients completed the three month double-blind randomized treatment.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Since TNX-102 SL will be submitted as a 505(b)(2) NDA using CBP 5 mg IR tablets as our reference product, we plan to study TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg in comparison to CBP 5 mg IR tablets in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The results of this study will provide information regarding blood levels of CBP at steady state after repeated dosing of CBP 5 mg IR tablet and TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	We expect the data from this study to serve as a bridge to enable us to use the reference product labeling information to support the TNX-102 SL NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	In addition to the clinical studies necessary to support the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA filing for the management of fibromyalgia, we proposed, and the FDA has accepted, our nonclinical data package to support the NDA filing, as the NDA requires nonclinical information that is not completely available in the reference product labeling.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	In 2014, we completed dose-ranging studies to identify the doses for the chronic toxicity studies requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the CBP labeling which will be used to support the TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	In January 2015, we engaged an FDA-certified Good Laboratory Practices laboratory to conduct a six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of TNX-102 in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	The in-life portion of these studies has been completed and reports are being prepared.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	Based on the prescribing information of AMRIX and FLEXERIL (discontinued since May 2013) and the post-marketing surveillance information, there is no evidence of abuse for CBP.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	As a result, the FDA has advised that we will not have to assess the abuse potential of TNX-102 SL for the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA submission.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	The TNX-102 SL drug product manufactured for our Phase 2b BESTFIT study was manufactured in a small-scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	For Phase 3 trials and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	The product s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of the single-dose pharmacokinetic study (F105).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have an Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or iPSP, with the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	The iPSP contains (i) an agreement whereby we will submit a protocol to conduct a single dose, open-label pharmacokinetic study in adolescent patients (13-17 years of age) with fibromyalgia before our NDA filing and (ii) a partial waiver of the requirement to submit pediatric assessments of TNX-102 SL per Section 505B(a)(4)(A)(i) of the FDCA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	A Final Pediatric Study Plan requirement will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Based our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the NDA filing.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for FM, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	We expect to register TNX-102 SL with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	This regulatory pathway may help to accelerate product development and reduce overall business risk.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	The 505(b)(2)-based product development plan for TNX-102 SL is designed to leverage the safety data that have been generated by other manufacturers for CBP-containing products and accepted by the FDA in support of their product registrations, in addition to the safety data we generate.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	TNX-102 SL contains significantly less CBP than other marketed products that contain CBP.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	We believe that the nonclinical safety data package from these products, together with their marketing experience, will provide an adequate safety margin to support TNX-102 SL development and marketing application for FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	If NDA approval of TNX-102 SL is granted, in addition to the three-year marketing exclusivity provided by law, we expect this product to be protected by patents that extend through at least 2021, during which time it should not be subject to generic substitution.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	We plan to continue to support the TNX-102 SL program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and in FM patients.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	For example, we have recently filed patent applications on TNX-102 SL which, if issued, would be expected to provide protection from generic substitution until at least 2033.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD under a separate IND, cleared by the FDA in June 2014, and we are currently conducting our AtEase trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in military-related PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Patients who successfully complete the AtEase study are eligible to enroll into a three-month open-label extension study (P202).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The clinical presentations of FM and PTSD share a number of similarities and clinical overlap.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	For example, in a survey of males with PTSD or major depression, 49% of PTSD patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM compared to 5% of major depression patients (Amital et al, J Psychosom Res 2006;61:663-669).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Conversely, in a different survey of FM patients, 57% of the patients had symptoms associated with PTSD (Cohen et al, Semin Arthritis Rheum 2002;32:38-50).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	As with FM, a core feature of PTSD is sleep disturbance.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Sleep disturbances are believed to exacerbate daytime symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, poor concentration, and diminished interest in significant activities.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	The sleep disturbances of PTSD, which include nightmares and night terrors, may be more pronounced than those typically experienced by FM patients.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	Our rationale for developing TNX-102 SL for treatment of PTSD is supported by the following:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Results from our BESTFIT study, which showed that treatment with TNX-102 SL resulted in: 1) an observed statistically significant improvement of FM, a separate but related central nervous system disorder having significant overlap with PTSD (Chrousos, 2009); 2) an observed statistically significant improvement in sleep quality in FM, which is similarly impaired in PTSD and central to the neuropathology (Germain, 2013); and 3) statistically significant improvements in anxiety and sensory sensitivity, symptoms that are of particular relevance to PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	In research from peer-reviewed scientific publications, we have identified a number of compounds that are antagonists of the serotonin 2A and/or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that have been shown to have beneficial effects in treating PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Therefore, it is our belief that TNX-102 SL, a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, will have a therapeutic effect in treating PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced the AtEase trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 trial of TNX-102 SL in approximately 240 patients with military-related PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	In the AtEase study, patients are randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or placebo, respectively, sublingually once daily at bedtime.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	This trial is being conducted at approximately 25 U.S. centers.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	In December 2015, we announced that enrollment in AtEase has completed.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	The primary objective of the AtEase trial is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg as compared to placebo sublingual tablet following 12 weeks of treatment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	If the AtEase study achieves success in its primary outcome measure, it could serve as one of the two pivotal studies required to establish sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	We expect to report top line results from the AtEase study in the second quarter of 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	The TNX-102 SL drug product manufactured for our Phase 2 AtEase trial was manufactured in a small-scale cGMP facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	For Phase 3 trials and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	The product s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of single-dose pharmacokinetic study (F105).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	An End-of-Phase 2 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Meeting has been held in February 2016 to discuss the quality data requirement for the NDA filing.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	As of the date of this filing, we have not received the FDA official minutes from the meeting.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	We expect to register TNX-102 SL in PTSD with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The FDA approvals of paroxetine and sertraline for treating PTSD established a regulatory approval pathway for symptom reduction in PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	Based on our communications with the FDA to date, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies (F203 and P202) would support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	We plan to meet with the FDA after we complete the AtEase study to further discuss our development plan for TNX-102 SL for PTSD, including the proposed design of the registration program that would be required to support approval of an NDA for this indication.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	If we achieve our primary outcome measure in the AtEase study, it could qualify as one of the two studies required to support the NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	We expect that we can use the long-term safety exposure data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM (F203) to supplement the long-term safety exposure data required for the PTSD NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	If the results from the AtEase study are positive, we plan to seek Fast Track Development and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is a relatively new and uncertain process for drugs intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition, the preliminary clinical evidence of which indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies, in which the majority of requests for designation have been denied.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	We were developing TNX-201 for the treatment of episodic tension-type headache under an IND cleared by the FDA in October 2014.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	ETTH is the most common type of headache, estimated to account for over 60% of headaches.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a single-dose Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate the ability of TNX-201 140 mg to improve headache pain as well as its tolerability in patients with ETTH.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	This trial was conducted at approximately 10 U.S. centers and randomized approximately 150 patients to receive TNX-201 140 mg or placebo capsules.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	This trial assessed efficacy following a dose of study medication according to a variety of measures at several time points, including the difference between the two study arms in the number of subjects who report complete relief from their headache pain at two hours.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S4	This study was designed to test the activity and tolerability of TNX-201 to support possible future efficacy and safety studies.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S5	We reported top line results from this study on February 16, 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P78_S6	Since TNX-201 failed to show any efficacy, we abandoned development of TNX-201.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed dose combination drug product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	We held a Pre-IND Meeting with the FDA in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development of TNX-301 for AUD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P80_S3	As of the date of this filing, we have not received the FDA official minutes from the meeting.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on two biodefense technologies: one relating to the development of novel smallpox vaccines; and the other to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	We have begun non-clinical research and development on these programs.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	The FDA Animal Efficacy Rule provides a mechanism for product licensure when human efficacy studies are not feasible or ethical.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	As a result, the licensure of these biodefense products in the U.S. may not require human efficacy studies, which we believe will reduce our development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S5	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S6	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P83_S7	Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	The markets for medicines to treat FM, PTSD and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	Eli Lilly (Cymbalta), Forest Laboratories (Savella), and Pfizer (Lyrica) market FDA approved drugs for FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P84_S2	Cymbalta lost its U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil) and Pfizer (Zoloft) market FDA approved drugs for PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	A number of companies are developing prescription medications for FM, including Allergan, Daiichi Sankyo, Meda, Merck, Pfizer, RiboCor and Theravance.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov.

1430306_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	As of March 1, 2016, we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to five issued U.S. patents and 26 issued non-U.S. patents.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P89_S3	We are actively pursuing an additional 17 U.S. patent applications, of which six are provisional and 11 are non-provisional, five international patent applications, and 70 non-U.S./non-international patent applications.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P90_S2	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	In the United States, a patent s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P95_S2	The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P95_S3	A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P95_S4	Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P95_S5	When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our three most advanced product candidates as of March 1, 2016 are summarized below.

1430306_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	The patent expiring last is expected to expire in 2024, excluding any patent term extensions.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, which is a new vaccine candidate against smallpox.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	With respect to the smallpox vaccine candidate, we own U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,207,727 and related intellectual property rights.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P102_S2	The smallpox vaccine technology relates to proprietary forms of live vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P102_S3	We believe that this technology, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S2	These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S3	We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S4	While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S5	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P104_S6	To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	Our current patents owned are as follows:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, U.K.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	Our current pending patent applications are as follows:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	We seek trademark and service mark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	We are the owner of the following U.S. federally registered marks: TONIX PHARMACEUTICALS (Reg.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	No. 4656463, issued 12/16/2015) and TONMYA (Reg.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	We are the owner of the following marks for which applications for U.S. federal registration are currently pending: FYMRALIN (Serial No. 86/516046, filed 01/27/2015), MODALTIN (Serial No. 86/631228, filed 05/15/2015), RAPONTIS (Serial No. 86/631236, filed 05/15/2015), IMADAZIO (Serial No. 86/631242, filed 05/15/2015), PROTECTIC (Serial No. 86/636119, filed 05/20/2015) and TONIX PHARMACEUTICALS (Serial No. 86/400401, filed 09/19/2014).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	We have approximately 15 employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P111_S1	We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase several fold as we continue our late-stage clinical development of TNX-102 SL and advance other candidates in our pipeline.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P111_S2	We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P111_S3	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego, CA, San Jose, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P111_S4	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P112_S0	We have contracted with third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P112_S1	For TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P112_S2	Our manufacturing operations are managed and controlled in Dublin, Ireland.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P113_S0	All of our compounds are small molecules, synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P114_S0	The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P114_S1	These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P114_S2	The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P114_S3	Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P115_S0	The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of dr ugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P115_S1	The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P116_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P117_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P118_S0	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P118_S1	The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P118_S2	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P119_S0	The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator s brochure.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P119_S1	An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P119_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P119_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P120_S0	An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P120_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P120_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P121_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P121_S1	Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P122_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P123_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P124_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P125_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P125_S1	Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease, but sometimes can include several thousand patients.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P126_S2	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P127_S1	These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P128_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P128_S2	Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P128_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P129_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P130_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P130_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P131_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P132_S1	We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P132_S2	We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P133_S1	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P133_S2	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P133_S3	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P134_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P135_S0	Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P135_S1	As such, we plan to submit NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P135_S2	The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for FM or PTSD as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P135_S3	If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P135_S4	If the FDA requires full NDAs for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P135_S5	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P136_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P136_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P136_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P136_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P137_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P138_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P138_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P139_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_16_ITEM1_P139_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P140_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P140_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P140_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P141_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P142_S0	The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P142_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P142_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P142_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P142_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P143_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P144_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P144_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P144_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P144_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P144_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P145_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P145_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P146_S0	On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P146_S1	FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation Breakthrough Therapy.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P146_S2	A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P147_S0	preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P148_S0	If a drug is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P148_S1	In the event that our AtEase study of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is successful, we will request Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P148_S2	The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is relatively new, and the majority of requests for designation have been denied.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P148_S3	We cannot predict the likelihood of success in seeking Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P149_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P149_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P149_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P149_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P149_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_16_ITEM1_P150_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P151_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P151_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P152_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P153_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P153_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P153_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P154_S0	In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, became law.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P154_S1	This legislation grants significant new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P154_S2	In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information, and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P154_S3	In addition, the new law significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P154_S4	Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P155_S0	The FDA has not yet implemented many of the provisions of the FDAAA, so we cannot predict the impact of the new legislation on the pharmaceutical industry or our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P155_S1	However, the requirements and changes imposed by the FDAAA may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P155_S2	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P155_S3	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P156_S0	As of March 1, 2016, we had 28 full-time employees, of whom eight hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P156_S1	We have 15 employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P156_S2	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego and San Jose, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P156_S3	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies as well as part-time employees.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P157_S0	None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P158_S0	Our principal executive offices are located at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022, and our telephone number is (212) 980-9155.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P158_S1	Our website addresses are www.tonixpharma.com, www.tonix.com, and www.krele.com.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P158_S2	We do not incorporate the information on our websites into this annual report, and you should not consider such information part of this annual report.
1430306_16_ITEM1_P159_S0	We were incorporated on November 16, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Tamandare Explorations Inc. On October 11, 2011, we changed our name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company and its prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of products that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We cannot assure you that we will ever have a product approved by the FDA, that we will bring any product to market or, if we are successful in doing so, that we will ever become profitable.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, preclinical and nonclinical testing, and clinical trial activities increase.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our operations to date have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials of our clinical-stage product candidates, TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or commercialized products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial condition has varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include other factors described elsewhere in this annual report and also include:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance policies.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Accordingly, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have no approved products on the market and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next couple of years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our clinical-stage product candidate, TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We currently have one product candidate in clinical stages of development for two indications: TNX-102 SL for the management of FM and PTSD, and the success of our business currently depends on its successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	TNX-102 SL has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for these product candidates anywhere in the world.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The clinical development programs for TNX-102 SL for FM or PTSD may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that these product candidates are safe and effective or a clinical program may be put on hold due to unexpected safety issues.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL for FM or PTSD in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because we have limited financial and human resources, we are currently focusing on the regulatory approval of TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our spending on existing and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and nonclinical testing, clinical trials and marketing activities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next 12 months.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We may, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to commence clinical trials or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors' products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs using our technologies and patents in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights and intellectual property rights in these and other countries.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents related to them.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide us any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and countries other than the United States may have less robust patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products using our technologies and patents.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents or propriety technologies on products we develop.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages to us of the patent.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the innovations specifically exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our success depends on our patents and patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents and patent applications to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These patents, patent applications, and published literature may limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of present and future patents and other proceedings of our competitors.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Litigation may be necessary to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Third parties may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable in these proceedings.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Such litigation can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third parties may also assert that our patents are invalid in patent office administrative proceedings.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These proceedings include oppositions in the European Patent Office and inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the USPTO.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The success rate of these administrative challenges to patent validity in the United States is higher than it is for validity challenges in litigation.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Interference or derivation proceedings brought before the USPTO may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to innovations disclosed in our patents or patent applications.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	During these proceedings, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Even if successful, an interference or derivation proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference or derivation proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	An adverse decision in litigation or administrative proceedings could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If preclinical and nonclinical testing or clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including CROs and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials involving our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical and nonclinical testing activities and clinical trials than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical trials, consistent with a clinical trial protocol.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Delays in preclinical and nonclinical testing, and clinical trials could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Once a clinical trial has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	nonclinical or clinical safety observations, including adverse events and serious adverse events.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If clinical trials are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	While we have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We will control only certain aspects of our CROs activities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that our clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA s current good clinical practices requirements, or cGCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with cGCPs.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	In addition, our clinical trials, including our planned Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM, will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, our clinical trials may be delayed or we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our CROs are not our employees, and we are not able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for such product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for our clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We have never conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial or submitted an NDA before, and may be unable to do so for, TNX-102 SL or other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In addition to our ongoing AFFIRM trial of TNX-102 SL in FM, we plan to initiate a second Phase 3 confirmatory trial in support of product registration prior to completion of the ongoing AFFIRM trial.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As these trials are intended to provide evidence to support marketing approval by the FDA, they are considered pivotal, or registration, trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The conduct of pivotal clinical trials and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Although members of our management team have extensive industry experience, including in the development, clinical testing and commercialization of drug candidates, our company has never conducted a pivotal clinical trial before (other than the ongoing AFFIRM trial), has limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings, and has not submitted an NDA before.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete these planned clinical trials in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials would prevent or delay commercialization of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our product candidates may cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects from TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The results of future clinical trials, including TNX-102 SL, may show that our product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or suffer from quality control issues:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If we are unable to file for approval of TNX-102 SL under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore reduce the development time.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	We held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in February 2013 to discuss our most advanced development program, in which we are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In late 2014, following the results of the BESTFIT trial, we corresponded with the FDA to further discuss our Phase 3 registration program plan.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012 to discuss the development of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Although our interactions with the FDA have encouraged our efforts to continue to develop TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, there is no assurance that we will satisfy the FDA s requirements for approval in these indications.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S5	The timeline for filing and review of our NDAs for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD is based on our plan to submit those NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which would enable us to rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P73_S6	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S6	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S7	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P74_S8	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may not be able to realize shortened development timelines for TNX-102 SL for FM or PTSD, and the FDA may not agree that any of our products qualify for marketing approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any safety reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL, and we may need to fulfill the more extensive requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We will need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	As we advance our product candidates through preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and develop new product candidates, we will need to increase our product development, scientific, regulatory and compliance and administrative headcount to manage these programs.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	continue to improve our operational, manufacturing, quality assurance, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Loss of the services of Dr. Lederman would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P81_S3	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P82_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Moreover, competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in drug development, product registration, clinical, preclinical and nonclinical research, quality compliance, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our trials, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We intend to rely on CMOs to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical trials and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates requires the manufacture of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P86_S3	We have contracted with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds, including TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P86_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for nonclinical, preclinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P86_S5	Although we are in discussions with other manufacturers we have identified as potential alternative CMOs of TNX-102 SL, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms with any of them.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with many of these manufacturers.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P87_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical trials, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P89_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P90_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P91_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P91_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P92_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P94_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P96_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P98_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical trials, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P101_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P103_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct adequate and well controlled clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P103_S2	Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P103_S3	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P103_S4	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P103_S5	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of stable and qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical trial protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials; the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The results from early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our clinical trials may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our product candidates are expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P105_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P105_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our product candidates in clinical development.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P106_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P106_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P108_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P108_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to an NDA under the FDCA.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P108_S3	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P108_S4	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P109_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P109_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P109_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P109_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P109_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P110_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P111_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Following completion of clinical trials, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P113_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study and other commitments or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P113_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs: six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P113_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P113_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA is approved.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P115_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P115_S1	None of our product candidates have been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P116_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P118_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P118_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P119_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P121_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P122_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P123_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P124_S1	Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P124_S2	Physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P124_S3	If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P126_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S0	Our strategy with our product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S4	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S5	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P127_S6	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P128_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P131_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P131_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P131_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P132_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P132_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P132_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P132_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P132_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P132_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P133_S0	In the event that we are successful in bringing any products to market, our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products successfully may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P135_S0	other third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P136_S0	We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for health care products to be approved in the future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P136_S1	Third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P136_S2	Government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs whether approved under Section 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2), or 505(j) of the FDCA, through direct payment mechanisms and through cost containment programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P138_S0	The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P138_S1	If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any prescription product we bring to market, doctors may not prescribe them or patients may ask to have their physicians prescribe competing drugs with more favorable reimbursement.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P139_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P139_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P139_S2	In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P139_S3	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P139_S4	Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P140_S0	If we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P141_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercialization outside of the United States, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P141_S1	We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P142_S0	difficulty in importing and exporting clinical trial materials and study samples.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P143_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators' drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S3	While we currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S4	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S5	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S6	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators' products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P144_S7	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P145_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P146_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P146_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P146_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P147_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P147_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P147_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P148_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P148_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P148_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P149_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P149_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P150_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P152_S0	We carry insurance for most categories of risk that our business may encounter, however, we may not have adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P152_S1	We currently maintain general liability, clinical trial, property, workers compensation, products liability and directors and officers insurance, along with an umbrella policy, which collectively costs approximately $300,000 per annum.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P152_S2	We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to maintain existing insurance at current or adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P152_S3	Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P153_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P154_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Sales of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P156_S0	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, by us or others, including the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P156_S1	We and our directors and officers may sell shares into the market, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P157_S0	The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P158_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P158_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P158_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P159_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P160_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P161_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P162_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P163_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P163_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P163_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P163_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P163_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P164_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P165_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P165_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P165_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P166_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P167_S0	The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P168_S1	As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P168_S2	Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P169_S0	The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P170_S0	Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create a series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P171_S0	If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P172_S0	If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P173_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P173_S1	If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P173_S2	Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P173_S3	If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P174_S0	Because certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P175_S0	As of March 2, 2016, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (those beneficially owning in excess of 5%), and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 30.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P175_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P175_S2	In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P175_S3	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P176_S0	discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P177_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P178_S0	The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P178_S1	Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P178_S2	Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
1430306_16_ITEM1A_P178_S3	If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1430306_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments at December 31, 2015.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	On February 11, 2014, we entered into a lease amendment and expansion agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises for office space, commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	In connection therewith, the original letter of credit was increased by $72,354 to $132,417 and we deposited an additional $72,354 into the restricted cash account maintained at the bank that issued the letter of credit.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Including the additional premises, the total square footage of our principal office space is approximately 4,800.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	On April 28, 2014, we entered into a lease for approximately 3,578 square feet of office space in San Jose, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2014 and expiring on October 31, 2018.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $44,546.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	On June 19, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 2,450 square feet of office space in Dublin, Ireland, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing June 1, 2015 and expiring on May 31, 2018.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	On July 27, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 132 square feet of office space in Montreal, Canada, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2015 and expiring on July 31, 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P4_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $800.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	On August 24, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 2,762 square feet of office space in San Diego, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing September 1, 2015 and expiring on August 31, 2019.
1430306_16_ITEM2_P5_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $11,272.

1430306_16_ITEM2_P7_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current business requirements.
1430306_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1430306_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

1430306_16_ITEM7_P1_S5	Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company s services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the invention and development of next-generation medicines.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our clinical-stage product candidates, TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, are directed toward conditions affecting the CNS.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of our most advanced candidate, TNX-102 SL, for the treatment of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	We are also developing TNX-102 SL as a potential treatment for PTSD, and we commenced a Phase 2 trial for this indication in the first quarter of 2015.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	We completed a Phase 2 trial of TNX-201 in ETTH in the first quarter of 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	When the drug failed to show efficacy, development was terminated.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	Our pipeline includes a preclinical program for the treatment of AUD as well as two biodefense development programs for protection from smallpox virus and from radiation injury.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P2_S7	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our therapeutic strategy in FM is supported by results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b BESTFIT trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Although the BESTFIT trial demonstrated only a positive trend and did not achieve statistical significance for TNX-102 SL in the primary efficacy analysis of change in mean pain intensity at week 12, it did demonstrate statistical significance (p 0.05) in a 30% responder analysis of the primary pain data, a declared secondary endpoint in which a responder is defined as a subject for whom pain intensity was reduced by at least 30% at week 12 as compared to baseline.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The BESTFIT trial also showed statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL in the declared secondary analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (p 0.05) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised, or FIQ-R (p 0.05).
1430306_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	In addition, the study showed statistically significant improvement with TNX-102 SL on measures of sleep quality as well as on several FIQ-R items.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	TNX-102 SL was well tolerated in the BESTFIT trial, and the most common adverse events were local in nature, with transient tongue or mouth numbness occurring in 44% of participants on TNX-102 SL vs. 2% on placebo, and bitter taste in 8% on TNX-102 SL compared to none on placebo.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	These local adverse events did not appear to affect either rates of retention of study participants or their compliance with taking TNX-102 SL.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Systemic adverse events were similar between TNX-102 SL and placebo.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	No serious adverse events were reported.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Among subjects randomized to the active and control arms, 86% and 83%, respectively, completed the 12-week dosing period.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	In August 2015, we completed a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL, into which patients who completed the BESTFIT study were eligible to enroll.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	On the basis of our discussions with the FDA, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Following the BESTFIT study, we received written guidance from the FDA which accepted our proposal to use a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint in our Phase 3 program to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	We initiated the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 3 AFFIRM trial of TNX-102 SL in 500 patients with FM in the second quarter of 2015, from which we expect to report top line results from this trial in the third quarter of 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	We plan to initiate a second Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM in the second quarter of 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	An End-of-Phase 2 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the quality data requirement for the TNX-102 SL NDA submission.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	As of the date of this filing, we have not received the FDA official minutes from the meeting.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are evaluating TNX-102 SL for the treatment of military-related PTSD in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 AtEase study, from which we expect to report top line results in the second quarter of 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The primary objective of the AtEase trial is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg as compared to placebo sublingual tablet following 12 weeks of treatment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Based on our communications with the FDA to date, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	If we achieve our primary outcome measure in the AtEase study, it could qualify as one of the two studies required to support the NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	We expect that we can use the data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM to supplement the long-term safety exposure data required for the PTSD NDA.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We were developing TNX-201 for the treatment of ETTH.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We completed a 150-patient Phase 2 study in ETTH and announced results of the study on February 16, 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	In that study patients were randomized at approximately 10 U.S. centers to receive TNX-201 140 mg (4 x 35 mg) or placebo capsules.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference between the two study arms in the number of subjects who report complete relief from their headache pain at two hours following a dose of study medication.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	We reported top line results from this study on February 16, 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	Since TNX-201 failed to show efficacy, we abandoned development of TNX-201.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed dose CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	We have initiated pre-IND consultation with the FDA to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	As of the date of this filing, we have not received the FDA official minutes from the meeting.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on two biodefense development programs for protection from smallpox virus and from radiation injury.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P11_S6	We have begun non-clinical research and development on these programs.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The FDA Animal Efficacy Rule provides a mechanism for product licensure when human efficacy studies are not feasible or ethical.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	As a result, the licensure of these biodefense products in the U.S. may not require human efficacy studies, which we believe will reduce our development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, but we also expend increasing effort on our other pipeline programs, including TNX-301.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing work and the cost of drug ingredients used in such work, fees paid to consultants for work related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy and safety of our drugs.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in FM and a Phase 2 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	In the second quarter of 2016, we plan to begin a second Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in FM.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Clinical trials can be very expensive.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	If these and additional necessary clinical trials are successful, we plan to prepare and submit applications to the FDA for marketing approval for our drug candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	As a result of these and other factors, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next 12 to 24 months.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We expect that all of our research and development expenses in the near-term future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P16_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected patient recruitment, or government delays.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold .
1430306_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We had no revenues or cost of goods sold during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 were $35,504, an increase of $16,887, or 91%, from $18,617 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	This increase is primarily due to increased development work related to TNX-102 SL and TNX-201, including formulation development, manufacturing, human safety and efficacy trials as well as pharmacokinetic studies.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	In 2015, we incurred $14,596, $4,963, $4,111 and $2,991 in clinical, non-clinical, manufacturing and medical research, respectively, as compared to $5,948, $1,501, $3,743 and $1,560 in 2014, respectively.

1430306_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	The increase in cash compensation-related costs of $1,495 was primarily a result of annual salary increases and added personnel.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Regulatory and legal costs increased to $1,763 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, from $1,403 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $360, or 26%.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	The increase in regulatory and legal costs is primarily due to the increase in active trials.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs increased to $1,353 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, from $580 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $773, or 133%.

1430306_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete.

1430306_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	On June 9, 2014, we approved the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holdings Corp. 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2014 ESPP ).
1430306_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	The 2014 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares of our common stock.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	Under the 2014 ESPP, on the first day of each offering period, each eligible employee for that offering period has the option to enroll for that offering period, which allows the eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of the offering period.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	Each offering period under the 2014 ESPP is for six months, which can be modified from time-to-time.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	Subject to limitations, each participant will be permitted to purchase a number of shares determined by dividing the employee s accumulated payroll deductions for the offering period by the applicable purchase price, which is equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is less.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P78_S5	A participant must designate in his or her enrollment package the percentage (if any) of compensation to be deducted during that offering period for the purchase of stock under the 2014 ESPP, subject to the statutory limit under the Code.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	The 2014 ESPP is considered a compensatory plan with the related compensation cost written off over the six month offering period.

1430306_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows (in thousands):
1430306_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P89_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We outsource our research and development efforts and expenses related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and clinical research organizations and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We account for trial expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	We determine accrual estimates that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P93_S3	We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P93_S4	Our clinical trial accruals and prepaid assets are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P94_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	We record an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	We recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P95_S3	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	Lessees (for capital and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S4	The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S5	Lessees may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
1430306_16_ITEM7_P96_S6	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of securities issued by the U.S. government, deposits, and money market deposits managed by commercial banks.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $43.0 million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the United States.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our portfolio of marketable securities includes certificates of deposit, corporate notes and U.S. Treasury and government agency bonds classified as available-for-sale securities, with no security having a maturity in excess of two years.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the relatively low risk profile of our investments, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a 1% movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our investment portfolio.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We do not hold more than a de minimus amount of foreign currency denominated financial instruments.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs.
1430306_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We do not believe that inflation and changing prices during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 had a significant impact on our results of operations.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1430306_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	A reconciliation of the effect of applying the federal statutory rate to the net loss and the effective income tax rate used to calculate the Company's income tax provision is as follows:
1430306_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
1430306_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company has incurred research and development ( R D ) expenses, a portion of which may qualify for tax credits.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	The Company has not conducted an R D credit study to quantify the amount of credits and has not claimed an R D credit on its federal tax returns filed except for $6,000 in 2007.

1430306_16_ITEM8_P101_S3	In such event, the net operating loss carryforward will be correspondingly reduced by the amount of the credit.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company had available unused net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards of approximately $24 million that expire from 2027 to 2035 for federal tax purposes.

1430306_16_ITEM8_P102_S5	The NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2015 have been reduced to reflect IRC section 382 ownership changes through December 31, 2014 and the resultant inability due to annual limitations, to utilize a portion of the NOL prior to its expiration.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P102_S6	Additional adjustments may be required based on ownership activity during 2015.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P103_S3	As such, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets.

1430306_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	Because loss per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters does not equal the total loss per share amount for the year.
1430306_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	On February 9, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 411,125 shares of the Company s common stock to employees with an exercise price of $5.03, exercisable for a period of ten years, vesting 1/3 on the first anniversary and 1/36th each month thereafter for 24 months.

1430306_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

1430306_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible enhancements to controls and procedures.

1430306_16_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P12_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P12_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P13_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P13_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1430306_16_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1430306_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp., together with its subsidiaries (collectively we, our, us, Tonix or the Company ), is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative pharmaceutical products to address public health challenges.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our most advanced drug development program is focused on delivering an efficacious and safe long-term treatment for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	PTSD is characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of PTSD and other central nervous system disorders.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	In September 2016, we discontinued our fibromyalgia program in order to fully focus our resources on our PTSD program.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, a proprietary low-dose cyclobenzaprine sublingual tablet, designed for bedtime administration, is in Phase 3 development as a potential treatment for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our development pipeline includes: TNX-601 (tianeptine oxalate), a separate pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) candidate designed for daytime administration for the treatment of PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with steroid use; TNX-801, a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of horsepox virus, or HPXV; TNX-301 an IND candidate for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, or AUD; and TNX-701, a biodefense development program for protection from radiation injury.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, for sublingual administration and transmucosal absorption.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	TNX-102 SL has a proprietary, Protectic protective eutectic formulation of cyclobenzaprine that allows for rapid systemic exposure and increased bioavailability through the transmucosal delivery.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD under an IND cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in June 2014.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	An estimated 8.6 million adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by hyperarousal, avoidance, emotional numbing, and sleep disturbances.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Antianxiety drugs, also called anxiolytics, are not approved for PTSD, but are commonly prescribed despite the recommendations against their use by many experts.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	Anxiolytics are comprised of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs, which carry risks of tolerance and addiction and are also associated with potential serious side-effects, such as retrograde amnesia.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	The principal components of our strategy are to:
1430306_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Develop TNX-102 SL for PTSD .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	We currently are focusing on the development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Maximize the commercial potential of TNX-102 SL .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	We plan to commercialize TNX-102 SL for PTSD, either on our own or through collaboration with partners.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	We believe TNX-102 SL can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	In the case of TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	We recently received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, for patent claims the will protect the pharmaceutical eutectic composition of TNX-102 SL until 2034.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	In the case of TNX-102 SL, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our product candidates address disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies and represent large potential commercial market opportunities.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Background information on the disorders and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates is set forth below.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	PTSD is a chronic syndrome that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Of those who experience significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S4	According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S5	As of 2015, there were approximately 638,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P20_S6	Based on March 2015 VHA data, more than 19% of military veterans involved in recent conflicts were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	The medications currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	TNX-102 SL is a proprietary sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We are developing TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved for pharmaceutical use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The current TNX-102 SL sublingual tablets contain 2.8 mg of CBP.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	For the treatment of PTSD, 5.6 mg of TNX-102 SL, comprised of two TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets administered simultaneously at bedtime, is in Phase 3 development.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	TNX-102 SL is a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and we refer to it as a Serotonin and Norepinephrine receptor Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor, or SNARI.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	In PTSD, both paroxetine and sertraline are believed to exert their clinical benefit primarily by blocking serotonin reuptake.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	As such, TNX-102 SL acts upon cellular receptors that play important roles in the treatment of PTSD, including the transporters that mediate serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition, TNX-102 SL also acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for PTSD, including the serotonin 2A, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H-1 receptors.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: FLEXERIL (oral immediate-release tablet, 5 mg and 10 mg dosage forms) and AMRIX (oral extended-release capsule, 15 mg and 30 mg dosage forms).
1430306_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	The FLEXERIL brand of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablet has been discontinued since May 2013.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	There are numerous generic versions of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablets on the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	CBP-containing products are not indicated for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	Immediate-release, or IR, CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day immediate-release CBP tablets.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	We designed TNX-102 SL to be administered once-daily at bedtime and intended for long-term dosing regimen.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	We believe the selected dose of TNX-102 SL and its pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral immediate-release CBP tablets.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	In clinical studies, TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg were generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in these studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We expect that any applications we submit to the FDA for approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for product candidates containing an active ingredient that is similar or identical to an already approved product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	Currently, we are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 3 development.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to provide clinical benefit to this and possibly other CNS indications that are underserved by currently marketed products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	On March 10, 2017, we received a notice of allowance for the US patent application No. 14/214,433 Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride , which includes compositions of cyclobenzaprine HCl and methods of manufacturing the eutectic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	The allowed claims will protect the pharmaceutical composition, since it is based on the eutectic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	The allowed claims will also protect the method of manufacturing the eutectic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Eutectic tablets containing cyclobenzaprine HCl and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal s lattice.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The distance between the molecular units is not changed.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2034 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD under an effective IND application.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 study of TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related PTSD, which we refer to as the AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	We reported topline results from the AtEase study in May 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	In the AtEase study, patients were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	This study was conducted at 24 U.S. centers and enrolled 231 patients in the modified intent-to-treat population.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	The primary objective of the AtEase study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using TNX-102 SL to treat military-related PTSD at a dose of 2.8 mg or 5.6 mg.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5, or CAPS-5, between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	The CAPS-5 scale is a standardized structured clinician interview and is considered the gold standard in clinical research and regulatory approval for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	AtEase was adequately designed to evaluate whether a 2.8 mg dose would be efficacious, which would have provided an opportunity for this study to be used as one of the two pivotal efficacy studies required to support approval of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Although the 2.8 mg dose trended in the direction of a therapeutic effect, it did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	The 5.6 mg dose had a therapeutic effect as assessed by the CAPS-5 scale, which was statistically significant by Mixed-effect Model Repeated Measures, or MMRM, with Multiple Imputation, or MI, analysis (p-value = 0.031), even though this arm of the study, by design, included only approximately half the number of patients of the 2.8 mg and placebo arms.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg demonstrated a dose-effect on multiple efficacy and safety measurements in the AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	In the AtEase study, TNX-102 SL was well tolerated and the patient retention rate was 73% on placebo, 79% on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and 84% on TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Four distinct serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported in the study; three were in the placebo group, and one (proctitis/peri-rectal abscess) in the TNX-102 SL arm, which was determined to be unrelated to TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	The most common non-dose related adverse events were mild and transient local administration site conditions and of these oral hypoaesthesia, or numbness, was the most frequent and occurred in 39% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 36% of the patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 2% of the patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	Oral paresthesia, or tingling, occurred in 16% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 4% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 3% of the patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S4	Glossodynia, or a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth, occurred in 3% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 6% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 1% of patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S5	Systemic adverse events that were potentially dose-related and occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose or placebo included: somnolence in 16% versus 6% of the patients receiving placebo; dry mouth in 16% versus 11% of the patients receiving placebo; headache in 12% versus 4% of the patients receiving placebo; insomnia in 6% versus 9% of the patients receiving placebo; sedation in 12% versus 1% of the patients receiving placebo; upper respiratory tract infection in 4% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo; abnormal dreams in 2% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo; and weight increase in 2% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P39_S6	For the patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose, the incidence of the most common systemic adverse events reported above were less frequent than patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose with the exception of insomnia, which was 8%.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Patients who completed the AtEase study were eligible to enroll into a three-month open-label extension study with TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	We conducted this open-label extension study to obtain additional safety information from patients in the AtEase Study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	The clinical phase of this open-label extension study is complete.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg was well tolerated for up to six months of treatment and no new safety signals were revealed in this open-label extension study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	We have commenced a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in approximately 550 patients with military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	This first Phase 3 study, the HONOR study, is an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	The study design is very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study , except there will be one planned interim analysis and the involvement of an independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, to review unblinded interim analysis results.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	The IDMC will make a recommendation to continue as planned, to continue but increase the number of recruited patients or to stop for success.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	In addition, there will be one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) and the entrance criterion is CAPS-5 33 in this Phase 3 study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	The interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 50% (approximately 250 300 patients) of the initially planned patient enrollment is evaluable for efficacy.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S6	We received FDA acceptance of the Phase 3 HONOR study design in January of 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P41_S7	The HONOR study involves approximately 35 U.S. centers.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	As in the case of the AtEase study, the primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study is the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg and those receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	A second, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in approximately 550 predominantly civilian PTSD patients will follow.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	We expect this study to be conducted at approximately 35 U.S. centers.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	As in the case of the HONOR and AtEase studies, the primary efficacy endpoint of this second Phase 3 study will be the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg and those receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	We plan to conduct the registration-required open-label extension studies of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg in patients who complete either the HONOR study or the predominantly civilian PTSD Phase 3 study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	6- and 12-month safety exposure data from the maximum therapeutic dose to support the registration of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD, a chronic psychiatric condition.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Subsequent to reporting the Phase 2 AtEase study topline result, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in early August 2016 to discuss the Phase 3 program required to support the registration of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for the treatment of PTSD and the remaining data package for the NDA filing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Based on this meeting discussion and the official FDA meeting minutes, we expect that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support the clinical approval of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	As described below, the first Phase 3 study will be in patients with military-related PTSD and the second Phase 3 study will study predominately civilian PTSD patients.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	We held an End-of-Phase 2 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, meeting with the FDA in February 2016 to discuss the quality data requirement for an NDA submission for TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	In general, our proposed NDA CMC plan for TNX-102 SL was acceptable to the FDA and can be applied to the PTSD NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was based on the preliminary clinical evidence of TNX 102-SL on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA within six months instead of 10 months and rolling submission of portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA's senior managers contributing significant guidance.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our drug development program.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	In March 2017, we held the Initial Cross-Disciplinary Breakthrough Therapy Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the opportunity to accelerate the development and submission of the TNX-102 SL NDA for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, a single-study NDA approval could be possible based on topline data from the ongoing HONOR study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Additionally, due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of TNX-102 SL, the FDA agreed that studies in assessing abuse potential of TNX-102 SL are not required to support the TNX-102 SL NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or Agreed iPSP, is required for the initial NDA submission.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	We submitted an Agreed iPSP in the first quarter of 2017, which incorporated the FDA comments received on our Initial Pediatric Study Plan submitted in the third quarter of 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	A Final Pediatric Study Plan requirement will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the NDA filing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for PTSD and the long-term safety data (up to 15 months) on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg in a prior fibromyalgia program, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	Similarly, no drug abuse and dependence study is required for this NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We completed a Phase 1 bioequivalence study that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of single-dose of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: (i) the facility used to produce TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets for the Phase 2 AtEase study; and (ii) the facility used to produce TNX-102 SL 2.8.mg tablets for our clinical studies required to support the PTSD NDA submission and the to-be-marketed product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	This bioequivalence study demonstrated that the TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at these two facilities were bioequivalent, supporting the use of the AtEase study to support the Phase 3 studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	We intend to seek FDA marketing approval for TNX-102 SL pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA using AMRIX extended-release capsules (30 mg) as our reference listed drug, or RLD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	As agreed upon by the FDA, we plan to study TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (two 2.8 mg tablets) in comparison to AMRIX 30 mg extended-release capsules in a multiple-dose bridging PK study to provide a systemic exposure bridge.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	If the exposures of TNX-102 SL (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) are less than the RLD maximum approved dose (30 mg) for the initial dose and at steady state, the results of this study will provide the necessary systemic exposure bridge of TNX-102 SL 5.6.mg to AMRIX 30 mg extended-release capsules and the approval of TNX-102 SL for PTSD can rely on the safety findings (clinical and nonclinical) of the currently approved cyclobenzaprine drug products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	To support the TNX-102 SL product registration, a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, food-effect, comparative bioavailability study of TNX-102 SL following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions and a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, dose-proportionality, comparative bioavailability study of TNX-102 SL following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions will be completed for the TNX-102 SL NDA submission.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	The FDA has accepted our proposed nonclinical data package to support our PTSD NDA filing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	In October 2016, we completed the six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of TNX-102 in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S., if necessary.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	These chronic toxicity studies were requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the AMRIX approved prescribing information, or labeling, which is necessary to support the TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	Based on the prescribing information of AMRIX and the post-marketing surveillance information, there is no evidence of abuse for cyclobenzaprine.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P56_S4	As a result, the FDA has advised that we will not have to assess the abuse potential of TNX-102 SL to support the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA submission for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	The TNX-102 SL drug product was manufactured in a small-scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	For the HONOR study, the predominantly civilian PTSD Phase 3 study and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	The product s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of the single-dose pharmacokinetic study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including two pre-IND candidates, TNX-601 for PTSD and TNX-801, a biologic vaccine product for the prevention of smallpox, as well as an IND candidate, TNX-301, a potential treatment for AUD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	TNX-601 is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate in the pre-IND stage of development for the treatment for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Currently there is no tianeptine-containing product approved in the U.S., but tianeptine sodium (amorphous) has been marketed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America for the treatment of depression since 1987.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	It is effective in various depressive states and also improves depression-associated anxiety and somatic complaints.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have discovered a novel oxalate salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Like cyclobenzaprine, tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants, but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	Tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the neuroplastic changes that are observed during periods of stress and corticosteroid use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	It is a weak mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, but does not have significant affinity for other known neurotransmitter receptors.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Due to its use in Europe, Asia, and Latin America for several decades, tianeptine has an established safety profile.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition to being used to treat depression, several published studies support the potential of tianeptine as a potentially effective and safe therapy for patients with PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 is being developed for daytime usage as a first-line monotherapy for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Tianeptine s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	On April 19, 2016, we were issued US patent 9,314,469 B2 Method for treating neurocognitive dysfunction, which includes using tianeptine for cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	We intend to develop TNX-601 under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 has been initiated.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of HPXV grown in cell culture.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	TNX-801 was synthesized by Professor David Evans and Dr. Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta, Canada in collaboration with us.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	HPXV has protective vaccine activity in mice, using a model of lethal vaccinia infection.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	Vaccine manufacturing activities have been initiated to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for widespread immunization and for the U.S. strategic national stockpile.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P66_S3	Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique virulence properties that we believe may suggest lower toxicity and potential safety advantages over existing vaccinia-based vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	We intend to develop TNX-801 under 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, pursuant to which the FDA may grant marketing approval for a biological product for which safety has been established in humans and for which the requirements for efficacy are met based on adequate and well-controlled animal studies, where human studies are not ethical or feasible.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	This approval pathway has been described as the Animal Rule .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	In the 1970s, vaccination against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	In addition, 12 years of non-patent based exclusivity is expected under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon FDA approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P68_S4	We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed-dose combination drug product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	At that meeting, the FDA advised us of the nonclinical studies required for this CDP IND application to support the initiation of the first-in-man study with TNX-301.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	Similar to the regulatory pathway intended for TNX-801, we plan to develop TNX-701 under 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, or the Animal Rule .
1430306_17_ITEM1_P70_S3	We expect significant reduction in development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S5	Our competitors drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S6	We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P71_S7	Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The markets for medicines to treat PTSD and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil ) and Pfizer (Zoloft ) market FDA-approved drugs for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Certain other companies and institutions are known to be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Bionomics (BNC-201), Otsuka/Lundbeck (Rexulti [brexpiprazole]), Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (riluzole) and the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies ( methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]).
1430306_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	BNC-201 is in Phase 2 for civilian PTSD and is an allosteric modulator of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	Rexulti is in Phase 2 for PTSD and is an atypical antipsychotic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	Riluzole is in a Phase 2 trial for active duty military members and veterans with PTSD and is a blocker of certain sodium channels and a modulator of the glutamatergic system.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P74_S3	MDMA is Phase 3 ready for PTSD and is a Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, schedule 1 hallucinogen that is being studied for drug-assisted psychotherapy.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P74_S4	Brainsway Ltd., a medical device company, is currently recruiting patients for a pivotal Phase 3 trial using a deep transcranial magnetic stimulation device.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P74_S5	A number of other companies have or may be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Actavis, Johnson and Johnson, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Merck, and Pfizer.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of PTSD include: anti-depressants, such as nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; and certain atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and risperidone.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	Additionally, a number of companies are working on vaccines/treatments for smallpox, including Bavarian Nordic, SIGA and Chimerix.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Bavarian Nordic is developing Modified Virus Ankara, or MVA, which is a vaccine.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	SIGA is developing Arestvy (tecovirimat), which is an antiviral.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	Chimerix is developing brincidofovir (CMX001), which is an antiviral.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	As of March 31, 2017, the patents we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to include three issued U.S. patents and 16 issued non-U.S. patents.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	We are actively pursuing an additional 15 U.S. patent applications, of which four are provisional and 11 are non-provisional, one international patent application, and 71 non-U.S./non-international patent applications.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology.

1430306_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	In the United States, a patent s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the PTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P83_S2	The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P83_S3	A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P83_S4	Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P83_S5	When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our three most advanced product candidates as of March 31, 2017 are summarized below.

1430306_17_ITEM1_P86_S3	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034 or 2035, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	On March 10, 2017, we received a notice of allowance from the PTO for the US patent No. 14/214,433 Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride, which includes compositions of cyclobenzaprine HCl and methods of manufacturing the eutectic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	The allowed claims will protect the pharmaceutical composition since it is based on the eutectic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	The allowed claims will also protect the method of manufacturing the eutectic.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	Eutectic tablets containing cyclobenzaprine HCl and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal lattice.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	The distance between the molecular units is not changed.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	The unique pharmacokinetic profile of TNX-102 SL was discovered by Tonix and its development partners and is termed the PK Technology.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	The patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL relating to the PK Technology includes patent applications directed to compositions of matter of CBP, formulations containing CBP, and methods for treating PTSD and other CNS conditions utilizing these compositions and formulations.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P90_S2	The PK Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 13/918,692.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P90_S3	If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2033, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	Our patent portfolio for tianeptine oxalate includes U.S. provisional Patent Application No. 62/439,533.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	It includes claims directed to composition, including pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, TNX-801, a live HPXV that is a new vaccine candidate against smallpox.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	We have patent applications directed to synthetic chimeric poxviruses and methods of using these poxviruses to protect individuals against smallpox.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	These applications include U.S. provisional Patent Application Nos.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	We also own the rights to develop some different vaccine candidates against smallpox.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	With respect to this smallpox vaccine candidate, we own U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,207,727 and related intellectual property rights.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P93_S3	The smallpox vaccine technologies relate to proprietary forms of live HPXV and vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P93_S4	We believe that this technology, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our patent portfolio for disulfiram and selegiline combinations includes patents and patent applications.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	It includes claims directed to disulfiram and selegiline, pharmaceutical compositions containing disulfiram and selegiline, disulfiram and selegiline formulations, methods of treating AUD, and methods of modulating alcohol abuse and dependence.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	It includes issued U.S. Patent Nos. 8,093,300 and 8,481,599.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P94_S3	The patent expiring last is expected to expire in 2024, excluding any patent term extensions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, which is a potential radioprotective therapy.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	For protection of intellectual property, we have not disclosed the identity of the new development candidate.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S3	We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S4	While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S5	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P97_S6	To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, Switzerland, U.K.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	Our current pending patent applications are as follows:
1430306_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	We seek trademark and service mark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	We are the owner of the following U.S. federally registered marks: TONIX PHARMACEUTICALS (Reg.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	No. 4656463, issued December 16, 2014) and TONMYA (Reg.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P101_S2	No. 4868328, issued December 8, 2015).
1430306_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	We are the owner of the following marks for which applications for U.S. federal registration are currently pending: FYMRALIN (Serial No. 86/516046, filed January 27, 2015), MODALTIN (Serial No. 86/631228, filed May 15, 2015), RAPONTIS (Serial No. 86/631236, filed May 15, 2015), IMADAZIO (Serial No. 86/631242, filed May 15, 2015), PROTECTIC (Serial No. 86/636119, filed May 20, 2015), TONIX PHARMACEUTICALS (Serial No. 86/400401, filed September 19, 2014) and ANGSTRO-TECHNOLOGY (Serial No. 86/713402, filed August 3, 2015).
1430306_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	We have approximately 10 employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will decrease as we focus our efforts on our late-stage clinical development of TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P103_S2	We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P103_S3	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P103_S4	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	We have contracted with third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	For TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P104_S2	Our manufacturing operations are managed and controlled in Dublin, Ireland.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	All of our small molecules drug candidates are synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	Our smallpox-preventing vaccine candidate is a biologic uses live form of HPXV.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	Both the drug substance (horsepox virus and the cell bank) and the drug product (vaccine) will be manufactured by contract cGMP-compliant facilities capable of manufacturing for nonclinical/clinical testing and licensed product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P107_S2	The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P107_S3	Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P108_S1	The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
1430306_17_ITEM1_P109_S0	FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P110_S0	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P111_S0	Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P111_S1	The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P111_S2	Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P112_S0	The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator s brochure.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P112_S1	An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P112_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P112_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P113_S0	An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P113_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P113_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P114_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P114_S1	Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P115_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P116_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P117_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P118_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P118_S1	Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P119_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P119_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P120_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P121_S0	Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P121_S1	These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P122_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P122_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P122_S2	Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P122_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P123_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P124_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P124_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P124_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P125_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P126_S1	We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P126_S2	We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P127_S0	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P127_S1	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P127_S2	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P127_S3	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P128_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P128_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P129_S1	As such, we plan to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P129_S2	The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for PTSD as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P129_S3	If the FDA determines that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA is not appropriate and that a full NDA is required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P129_S4	If the FDA requires a full NDA for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P129_S5	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P130_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P130_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P130_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P132_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_17_ITEM1_P133_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P134_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P134_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P136_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P136_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P136_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P136_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P138_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P138_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P138_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P138_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P139_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P140_S1	FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation Breakthrough Therapy.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P140_S2	A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:
1430306_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was submitted based on the preliminary clinical evidence of TNX 102-SL on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P143_S1	The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA within six months instead of 10 months and rolling submission of portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA's senior managers contributing significant guidance.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P143_S2	The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our drug development program.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P144_S1	One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P144_S2	The Act created a new priority review voucher program for material threat medical countermeasures.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	The Act defines such countermeasures as drugs or vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, and botulism.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10 months to 6 months.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	We intend to seek a priority voucher for TNX-801 as a material threat medical countermeasure.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P147_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P147_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P147_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P147_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P147_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_17_ITEM1_P148_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P149_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P149_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P150_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P151_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P151_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P151_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S0	The FDCA is subject to routine legislative amendments with a broad range of downstream effects.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S1	In addition to new legislation, such as the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, or the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012, Congress introduces amendments to reauthorize drug user fees and address emerging concerns every five years.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S2	We cannot predict the impact of these new legislative acts and their implementing regulations on our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S3	The programs established or to be established under the legislation may have adverse effects upon us, including increased regulation of our industry.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S4	Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S5	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S6	For example, the 21st Century Cures Act establishes a number of requirements, such as the public disclosure of information on experimental treatments, which may be costly and take time to implement.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P152_S7	Additionally, the current legislative authority for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act expires in September 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P153_S0	The requirements and changes imposed by the legislation to reauthorize the act may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P153_S1	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P154_S0	As of April 12, 2017, we had 18 full-time employees, of whom five hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P154_S1	We have 10 employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P154_S2	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P154_S3	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies as well as part-time employees.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P155_S0	None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P156_S0	Our principal executive offices are located at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022, and our telephone number is (212) 980-9155.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P156_S1	Our website addresses are www.tonixpharma.com, www.tonix.com, and www.krele.com.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P156_S2	We do not incorporate the information on our websites into this annual report, and you should not consider such information part of this annual report.
1430306_17_ITEM1_P157_S0	We were incorporated on November 16, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Tamandare Explorations Inc. On October 11, 2011, we changed our name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We and our prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of products that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, nonclinical and CMC development, laboratory testing and clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We cannot assure you that we will ever have a product approved by the FDA, that we will bring any product to market or, if we are successful in doing so, that we will ever become profitable.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, preclinical and nonclinical testing, and clinical study activities increase.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our operations to date have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies of our clinical-stage product candidate, TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or commercialized products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our financial condition has varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include other factors described elsewhere in this annual report and also include:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance policies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Accordingly, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We have no approved products on the market and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next couple of years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our clinical-stage product candidate, TNX-102 SL for PTSD, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We currently have one product candidate, TNX-102 SL, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of PTSD, and the success of our business currently depends on its successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	TNX-102 SL has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for this product candidate anywhere in the world.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The clinical development program for TNX-102 SL for PTSD may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical studies fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective or a clinical program may be put on hold due to unexpected safety issues.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical study process.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical studies or obtaining regulatory approvals for TNX-102 SL for PTSD in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because we have limited financial and human resources, we are currently focusing on the regulatory approval of TNX-102 SL for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our spending on existing and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and nonclinical testing, clinical studies and marketing activities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next 12 months.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidate.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We will, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to commence or complete clinical studies or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current product candidates can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors' products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs using our technologies and patents in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights and intellectual property rights in these and other countries.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents related to them.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide us any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and countries other than the United States may have less robust patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products using our technologies and patents.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents or propriety technologies on products we develop.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages to us of the patent.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the innovations specifically exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our success depends on our patents and patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents and patent applications to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These patents, patent applications, and published literature may limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of present and future patents and other proceedings of our competitors.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Litigation may be necessary to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Third parties may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable in these proceedings.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Such litigation can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Third parties may also assert that our patents are invalid in patent office administrative proceedings.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	These proceedings include oppositions in the European Patent Office and inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the USPTO.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The success rate of these administrative challenges to patent validity in the United States is higher than it is for validity challenges in litigation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Interference or derivation proceedings brought before the USPTO may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to innovations disclosed in our patents or patent applications.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	During these proceedings, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Even if successful, an interference or derivation proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference or derivation proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	An adverse decision in litigation or administrative proceedings could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If preclinical and nonclinical testing or clinical studies for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including CROs and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies involving our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical and nonclinical testing activities and clinical studies than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical studies, consistent with a clinical study protocol.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Delays in preclinical and nonclinical testing, and clinical studies could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical studies may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The commencement of clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Once a clinical study has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	nonclinical or clinical safety observations, including adverse events and serious adverse events.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If clinical studies are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We rely on CROs and clinical study sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	While we have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	We will control only certain aspects of our CROs activities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA s current good clinical practices requirements, or cGCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical study participants are protected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators and clinical study sites.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical studies may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical studies before approving any marketing applications.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical studies did not comply with cGCPs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P62_S4	In addition, our clinical studies, including our ongoing Phase 3 HONOR study in military-related PTSD, will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, our clinical studies may be delayed or we may be required to repeat such clinical studies, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our CROs are not our employees, and we are not able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for such product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for our clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We have limited experience in completing a Phase 3 clinical study and have never submitted an NDA before, and may be unable to do so for TNX-102 SL or other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We initiated a Phase 3 study in military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As this study is intended to provide efficacy and safety evidence to support marketing approval by the FDA, it is considered a pivotal, confirmatory or registration, study.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The conduct of pivotal clinical studies and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Although members of our management team have extensive industry experience, including in the development, clinical testing and commercialization of drug candidates, we have conducted only one pivotal clinical study before (the AFFIRM study in fibromyalgia patients), have limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings, and have not submitted an NDA before.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete this planned clinical study in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical studies would prevent or delay commercialization of TNX-102 SL and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our product candidates may cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects from TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The results of future clinical studies, including TNX-102 SL, may show that our product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or suffer from quality control issues:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	If a competing drug shows efficacy in military-related PTSD prior to the FDA approval of TNX-102 SL or if TNX-102 SL fails to confirm the results of the AtEase Phase 2 study in showing activity in military-related PTSD in the Phase 3 HONOR study, then the FDA may rescind the Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	In December 2016, the FDA granted TNX-102 SL for PSTD Breakthrough Therapy designation based on several factors, including that TNX-102 SL has the potential to be an improvement over existing therapies for military-related PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If another therapy is shown to be effective in military-related PTSD before FDA approval of TNX-102 SL, then the FDA may rescind the designation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In addition, if TNX-102 SL fails to confirm the activity from the AtEase study in treating military-related PTSD, then the FDA may rescind the Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL may not lead to faster development or regulatory processes nor does it increase the likelihood that TNX-102 SL will receive marketing approval for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	There is no guarantee that the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation will result in a faster development, review or approval process for TNX-102 SL for PTSD or increase the likelihood that TNX-102 SL will be granted marketing approval for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Likewise, any future Breakthrough Therapy designation for any other potential indication of TNX-102 SL neither guarantees a faster development process, review or approval nor improves the likelihood of the granting of marketing approval by the FDA for any such potential indication of TNX-102 SL compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy designation for other of our product candidates, but the FDA may not grant this status to any of our proposed product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	If we are unable to file for approval of TNX-102 SL under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore reduce the development time.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012 to discuss the development of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Following the results of the AtEase Study, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in August 2016 to discuss our most advanced development program, in which we are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Although our interactions with the FDA have encouraged our efforts to continue to develop TNX-102 SL for PTSD, there is no assurance that we will satisfy the FDA s requirements for approval in this indication.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P77_S4	The timeline for filing and review of our NDA for TNX-102 SL for PTSD is based on our plan to submit this NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which would enable us to rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P77_S5	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S3	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S5	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S6	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S7	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P78_S8	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We may not be able to realize a shortened development timeline for TNX-102 SL for PTSD, and the FDA may not approve our NDA based on their review of the submitted data.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any safety reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for TNX-102 SL, and we may need to fulfill the more extensive requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our lead product candidate.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We will need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	As we advance our product candidates through preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and develop new product candidates, we will need to increase our product development, scientific, regulatory and compliance and administrative headcount to manage these programs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	continue to improve our operational, manufacturing, quality assurance, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Gregory M. Sullivan, our Chief Medical Officer.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Dr. Sullivan has served as our Chief Medical Officer since 2014 and directed the Phase 2 AtEase study and is directing the Phase 3 HONOR study.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Loss of the services of Drs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Lederman or Sullivan would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P87_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Moreover, competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P87_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in drug development, product registration, clinical, preclinical and nonclinical research, quality compliance, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our studies, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	We intend to rely on CMOs to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical studies and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Completion of our clinical studies and commercialization of our product candidates requires the manufacture of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P91_S3	We have contracted with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds, including TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P91_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical studies or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for nonclinical, preclinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P91_S5	Although we are in discussions with other manufacturers we have identified as potential alternative CMOs of TNX-102 SL, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms with any of them.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with many of these manufacturers.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P92_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical studies, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for cGMP compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P94_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical studies, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P95_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P96_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P96_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P96_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the DEA and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P99_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical studies, and our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P103_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical studies, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical studies, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P106_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Clinical studies required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct adequate and well controlled clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Conducting clinical studies is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P108_S3	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per study.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical studies may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical studies may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of stable and qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical studies; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical study protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical studies; the lack of effectiveness during clinical studies; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical studies due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P110_S0	The results from early clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P110_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical studies, we may not be able to confirm the results in future clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P110_S2	For example, in our Phase 3 AFFIRM trial in fibromyalgia, we were not able replicate the results we received from our Phase 2b BESTFIT trial.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P110_S3	Clinical studies may not demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Our clinical studies may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our product candidates are expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P111_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P111_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our product candidates in clinical development.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P112_S0	The failure of clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P112_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical studies would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical studies could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to an NDA under the FDCA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S3	The FDA applies the same standards for biologics, requiring an IND application, followed by a BLA prior to licensure.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S4	Other products, such as vaccines, are also regulated under the Public Health Service Act.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S5	FDA has conflated the standards for approval of NDAs and BLAs so that they require the same types of information on safety, effectiveness, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S6	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P114_S7	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P115_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P115_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P115_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P115_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P115_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P117_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Following completion of clinical studies, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P119_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study and other commitments or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P119_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs or BLAs: six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P119_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P119_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly, but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA or BLA is approved.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P121_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P121_S1	None of our product candidates have been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA or BLA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P122_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Our product candidates may face competition sooner than expected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S0	We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our product candidates provided under the FDCA and similar laws in other countries.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S1	We believe that TNX-801 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S2	Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product or BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S3	The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S4	The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing brand product.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S5	The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S6	While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for any of our product candidates that are biologics.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S7	There is also a risk that President Trump s administration could repeal or amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent protection.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S8	Although there is no current discussion of repeal or modification of the BPCIA, the future remains uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P124_S9	Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Our product candidates that are not, or are not considered, biologics that would qualify for exclusivity under the BPCIA may be eligible for market exclusivity as drugs under the FDCA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P126_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P127_S0	A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P127_S1	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P127_S2	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P127_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P127_S4	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Even if, as we expect, our product candidates are considered to be reference products eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA or five years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full BLA or full NDA for such product containing the sponsor s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Moreover, an amendment or repeal of the BPCIA could result in a shorter exclusivity period for our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P130_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P130_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical studies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P131_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P133_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P134_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P135_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P136_S1	Our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P136_S2	Physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P136_S3	If our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P138_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Our strategy with our product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S4	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S5	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P139_S6	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients' medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P140_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P140_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P142_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P143_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P143_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P143_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P144_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P144_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P144_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P144_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P144_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P144_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P145_S0	In the event that we are successful in bringing any products to market, our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payors.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P146_S0	Our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products successfully may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P147_S0	other third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P148_S0	We cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for health care products to be approved in the future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P148_S1	Third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs whether approved under Section 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2), or 505(j) of the FDCA, through direct payment mechanisms and through cost containment programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P150_S0	The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P150_S1	If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any prescription product we bring to market, doctors may not prescribe them or patients may ask to have their physicians prescribe competing drugs with more favorable reimbursement.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P151_S0	In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P151_S1	In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P151_S2	In addition, we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P151_S3	Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P151_S4	Further, cost control initiatives could impair our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P152_S0	If we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P153_S0	If TNX-102 SL or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercialization outside of the United States, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P153_S1	We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P154_S0	difficulty in importing and exporting clinical study materials and study samples.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P155_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators' drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical study participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S3	While we currently carry clinical study insurance and product liability insurance, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S4	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S5	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S6	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators' products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P156_S7	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P157_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P157_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P158_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P158_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P159_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P159_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P160_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P160_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P160_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P161_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P161_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P162_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P164_S0	We carry insurance for most categories of risk that our business may encounter, however, we may not have adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P164_S1	We currently maintain general liability, clinical study, property, workers compensation, products liability and directors and officers insurance, along with an umbrella policy, which collectively costs approximately $600,000 per annum.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P164_S2	We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to maintain existing insurance at current or adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P164_S3	Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P165_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P166_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P167_S0	We may be unsuccessful in obtaining a priority voucher for material threat medical countermeasures.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P168_S0	In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P168_S1	One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P168_S2	The Act created a new priority review voucher program for material threat medical countermeasures.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P169_S0	The Act defines such countermeasures as drugs or vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P169_S1	The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, and botulism.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P170_S0	A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10 months to 6 months.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P170_S1	The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P171_S0	We intend to seek a priority voucher for TNX-801 as a material threat medical countermeasure.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P171_S1	However, the structure of voucher programs limits the number of medical countermeasures eligible for a priority review voucher.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P171_S2	Further, the medical countermeasure must qualify for priority review in order to be eligible and may not include any commercially approved indication.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P171_S3	As such, the market for the TNX-801 will be limited if we are successful in obtaining a priority voucher.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P172_S0	There may not be market interest in TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P173_S0	The government is the only market for most medical countermeasures.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P173_S1	This is because unlike other drugs and vaccines, these products are not sold to doctors, hospitals, or pharmacies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P174_S0	The BioShield Special Reserve Fund, or SRF, has been the sole medical countermeasures market for the last decade; a 10 year advance appropriation of $5.6 billion was available to procure successful candidate medical countermeasures.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P174_S1	The SRF expired in 2013 and all funds were used to add 12 new medical countermeasures to the national stockpile.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P174_S2	Congress reauthorized the SRF but adequate funding has not yet followed; the SRF is now appropriated annually and has not kept pace with the need for purchasing products ready for stockpiling.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P174_S3	Further, similar products are being developed by other companies, such as Bavarian Nordic, which is developing MVA, which may compete with TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P174_S4	As such, even if TNX-801 were to receive FDA approval, the commercial success of TNX-801 remains uncertain.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P175_S0	If technology developed for the purposes of developing new medicines or vaccines can be applied to the creation or development of biological weapons, then our technology may be considered dual use technology and be subject to limitations on public disclosure or export.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P176_S0	Together with the University of Alberta, we are consulting with government authorities before publishing work that describes the synthesis of poxviruses, including TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P176_S1	Our research collaboration is dedicated not only to creating tools that better protect public health but also to safeguarding any information with broad, dual-use potential that could be inappropriately applied.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P177_S0	Dual use research is research conducted for legitimate purposes that generates knowledge, information, technologies, and/or products that can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat to public health, agricultural crops, or national security.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P177_S1	Because variola, the agent that causes smallpox, is a pox virus, the technology we created could be considered dual use and could be subject to export control, for example under the Wassenaar Arrangement.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P177_S2	Further, if federal authorities determine that our research is subject to institutional oversight, we will need to implement a risk-management plan developed in collaboration with the institutional review entity.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P177_S3	Failure to comply with the plan may result in suspension, limitation, or termination of federal funding or loss of future federal funding opportunities for any of our or the University of Alberta s research.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P178_S0	We face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P179_S0	We face a number of risks in connection with our current collaborations, including the University of Alberta.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P179_S1	Our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P179_S2	Our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively assist in the development of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P179_S3	Any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P179_S4	Further, disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the preferred course of development, might cause delays, might result in litigation or arbitration, or might result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P179_S5	Any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and costly.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P180_S0	We face risks in connection with the production and storage of the TNX-801 vaccine.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P181_S0	The TNX-801 vaccine candidate is a live form of HPXV.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P181_S1	We have initiated vaccine-manufacturing activities to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P182_S0	While it is safer than existing smallpox-preventing vaccines, the production and storage of the synthesized HPXV virus stock may carry risk of infection and harm to individuals.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P183_S0	HPXV, an equine disease caused by a virus and characterized by eruptions in the mouth and on the skin, is believed to be eradicated.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P183_S1	No true HPXV outbreaks have been reported since 1976, at which time the United States Department of Agriculture obtained the viral sample used for the sequence published in 2006 that allowed the synthesis of TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P184_S0	Sales of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P185_S0	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, by us or others, including the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P185_S1	We and our directors and officers may sell shares into the market, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P186_S0	The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P187_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P187_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P187_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P188_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P189_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P190_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P190_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P191_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P192_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P192_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P192_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P192_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P192_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P193_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P194_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P194_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P194_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P195_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P196_S0	The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P197_S0	Our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P197_S1	As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P197_S2	Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P198_S0	The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P199_S0	Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create a series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P200_S0	If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P201_S0	If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P202_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P202_S1	If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P202_S2	Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P202_S3	If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P203_S0	Because certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P204_S0	As of April 13, 2017, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (those beneficially owning in excess of 5%), and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 11.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P204_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P204_S2	In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P204_S3	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P205_S0	discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P206_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P207_S0	The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P207_S1	Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P207_S2	Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
1430306_17_ITEM1A_P207_S3	If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1430306_17_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments at December 31, 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	On February 11, 2014, we entered into a lease amendment and expansion agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises for office space, commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	In connection therewith, we executed a letter of credit, which has a remaining balance of $88,842 as of December 31, 2016, and we deposited such amount into the restricted cash account maintained at the bank that issued the letter of credit.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Including the additional premises, the total square footage of our principal office space is approximately 4,800.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	On April 28, 2014, we entered into a lease for approximately 3,578 square feet of office space in San Jose, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2014 and expiring on October 31, 2018.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $44,546.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	During December 2016, in an effort to reduce operating costs, we exited this facility and terminated this lease.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P2_S3	The total costs associated with exiting this facility were $0.1 million.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	On June 19, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 2,450 square feet of office space in Dublin, Ireland, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing June 1, 2015 and expiring on May 31, 2018.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	On July 27, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 132 square feet of office space in Montreal, Canada, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2015 and expiring on July 31 on an annual renewal basis.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P4_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $800.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	On August 24, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 2,762 square feet of office space in San Diego, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing September 1, 2015 and expiring on August 31, 2019.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P5_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $11,272.
1430306_17_ITEM2_P6_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows (in thousands):
1430306_17_ITEM2_P7_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current business requirements.
1430306_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1430306_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol TNXP .
1430306_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, after giving effect to the 1-for-10 reverse stock split, which was effected on March 17, 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	On April 12, 2017, the closing sale price of our common stock, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, was $4.75 per share.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	On April 12, 2017, there were 110 holders of record of our common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table summarizes information about our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our registered securities during the period covered by this Annual Report.
1430306_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may will, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and continue, or similar words.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P1_S5	Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to: substantial competition; our possible need for additional financing; uncertainties of patent protection and litigation; uncertainties of government or third party payor reimbursement; limited research and development efforts and dependence upon third parties; and risks related to failure to obtain FDA clearances or approvals and noncompliance with FDA regulations.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative pharmaceutical products to address public health challenges.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our most advanced drug development program is focused on delivering an efficacious and safe long-term treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	PTSD is characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of PTSD and other central nervous system disorders.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	In September 2016, we discontinued our fibromyalgia program in order to fully focus our resources on our PTSD program.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL, a proprietary low-dose cyclobenzaprine sublingual tablet, designed for bedtime administration, is in Phase 3 clinical development as a potential treatment for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	TNX-102 SL is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our therapeutic strategy in PTSD is supported by results from the AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We reported topline results from the AtEase study in May 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	In the AtEase study, patients were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	This study was conducted at 24 U.S. centers and enrolled 231 patients in the modified intent-to-treat population.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The primary objective of the AtEase study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using TNX-102 SL to treat military-related PTSD at a dose of 2.8 mg or 5.6 mg.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5, or CAPS-5, between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	The CAPS-5 scale is a standardized structured clinician interview and is considered the gold standard in clinical research and regulatory approval for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	AtEase was adequately designed to evaluate whether a 2.8 mg dose would be efficacious, which would have provided an opportunity for this study to be used as one of the two pivotal efficacy studies required to support approval of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Although the 2.8 mg dose trended in the direction of a therapeutic effect, it did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	The 5.6 mg dose had a therapeutic effect as assessed by the CAPS-5 scale, which was statistically significant by Mixed-effect Model Repeated Measures, or MMRM, with Multiple Imputation, or MI, analysis (p-value = 0.031), even though this arm of the study, by design, included only approximately half the number of patients of the 2.8 mg and placebo arms.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg demonstrated a dose-effect on multiple efficacy and safety measurements in the AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	In the AtEase study, TNX-102 SL was well tolerated and the patient retention rate was 73% on placebo, 79% on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and 84% on TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Four distinct serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported in the study; three were in the placebo group, and one (proctitis/peri-rectal abscess,) in the TNX-102 SL arm, which was determined to be unrelated to TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	The most common non-dose related adverse events were mild and transient local administration site conditions and of these oral hypoaesthesia, or numbness, was the most frequent and occurred in 39% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 36% of the patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 2% of the patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	Oral paresthesia, or tingling, occurred in 16% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 4% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 3% of the patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	Glossodynia, or a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth, occurred in 3% of patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 6% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 1% of patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Systemic adverse events that were potentially dose-related and occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose or placebo included: somnolence in 16% versus 6% of the patients receiving placebo; dry mouth in 16% versus 11% of the patients receiving placebo; headache in 12% versus 4% of the patients receiving placebo; insomnia in 6% versus 9% of the patients receiving placebo; sedation in 12% versus 1% of the patients receiving placebo; upper respiratory tract infection in 4% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo; abnormal dreams in 2% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo; and weight increase in 2% versus 5% of the patients receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	For the patients treated with the 2.8 mg dose, the incidence of the most common systemic adverse events reported above were less frequent than patients treated with the 5.6 mg dose with the exception of insomnia, which was 8%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including two pre-IND candidates, TNX-601 (tianeptine oxalate) for PTSD and TNX-801, a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine, an IND candidate, TNX-301, a potential treatment for AUD and TNX-701, a biodefense development program for protection from radiation injury.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	TNX-601 is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate in the pre-IND stage of development for the treatment for PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	We have discovered a novel salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 is being developed for daytime dosing as a first-line monotherapy for PTSD for daytime dosing.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Tianeptine s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than TNX-102 SL.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	On April 19, 2016, we were issued US patent 9,314,469 B2 Method for treating neurocognitive dysfunction which includes using tianeptine for cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	We intend to develop TNX-601 under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P15_S4	Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 has been initiated.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of HPXV grown in cell culture.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	TNX-801 was synthesized by Professor David Evans and Dr. Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta, Canada in collaboration with us.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	HPXV has protective vaccine activity in mice, using a model of lethal vaccinia infection.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Vaccine manufacturing activities have been initiated to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for widespread immunization and for the U.S. strategic national stockpile.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique virulence properties that we believe may suggest lower toxicity and potential safety advantages over existing vaccinia-based vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We intend to develop TNX-801 under 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, pursuant to which the FDA may grant marketing approval for a biological product for which safety has been established in humans and for which the requirements for efficacy are met based on adequate and well-controlled animal studies, where human studies are not ethical or feasible.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	This approval pathway has been described as the Animal Rule .
1430306_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	In the 1970s, vaccination against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	In addition, 12 years of non-patent based exclusivity is provided under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	It is unknown if a replacement bill will contain the 12 year exclusivity provision.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon FDA approval.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, quality to support an IND.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed-dose combination drug product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	At that meeting, the FDA advised us the nonclinical studies required for this CDP IND application to support the initiation of the first-in-man study with TNX-301.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Similar to the regulatory pathway intended for TNX-801, we plan to develop TNX-701 under 21 CFR 601 Subpart H, or the Animal Rule .
1430306_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	We expect significant reduction in development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing TNX-102 SL for PTSD, but we also expend increasing effort on our other pipeline programs, including TNX-601, TNX-801 and TNX-301.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing work and the cost of drug ingredients used in such work, fees paid to consultants for work related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy and safety of our drugs.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	We commenced a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in approximately 550 patients with military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	This first Phase 3 study, the HONOR study, is an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The study design is very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study , except there will be one planned interim analysis and the involvement of an independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, to review unblinded interim analysis results.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	The IDMC will make a recommendation to continue as planned, to continue but increase the number of recruited patients or to stop for success.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	In addition, there will be one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) and the entrance criterion is CAPS-5 33 in this Phase 3 study.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	The interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 50% (approximately 250 300 patients) of the initially planned patient enrollment is evaluable for efficacy.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P24_S6	We received FDA clearance of the first Phase 3 study design in January 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The HONOR study involves approximately 35 U.S. centers.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	As in the case of the AtEase study, the primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study is the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg and those receiving placebo.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We expect that all of our research and development expenses in the near-term future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected patient recruitment, lack of funding or government delays.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were $28.5 million, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 20%, from $35.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	This decrease is primarily due to decreased development work related to TNX-201 (dexisometheptene mucate) for episodic tension-type headache, including formulation development, manufacturing, human safety and efficacy trials as well as pharmacokinetic studies.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	This decrease is also due to decreased development work on TNX-102 SL for fibromyalgia.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	In 2016, we incurred $16.4 million, $1.4 million and $3.3 million in clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing, respectively, as compared to $16.8 million, $5.3 million and $4.4 million in 2015, respectively.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	Costs related to product development decreased to $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 67%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in active trials.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Compensation-related expenses increased to $4.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, from $4.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.4 million, or 10%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Cash compensation-related expenses were $3.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.7 million, or 24%, from $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	The increase was primarily a result of annual salary increases and increased personnel during parts of 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	We incurred $0.9 million in stock-based compensation in connection with the vesting of stock options in 2016, which were previously issued to officers and consultants, as compared to $1.2 million in stock-based compensation in 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	Regulatory and legal costs decreased to $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, from $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 28%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P32_S5	The decrease in regulatory and legal costs is primarily due to a shift in personnel related to then ongoing trials.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs decreased to $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, from $1.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 64%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to clinical development, including investigator meetings and medical-related conferences, whereas such activities decreased from 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	Other research and development costs were $0.8 million for both reporting periods.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	Other research and development costs include rent, insurance and other office-related expenses.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were $10.4 million, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 18%, from $12.7 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in activities related to compensation-related expenses and professional services.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Compensation-related expenses decreased to $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, from $5.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 10%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	We incurred $2.3 million in stock-based compensation in connection with the employee stock purchase plan and the vesting of restricted stock units and stock options in 2016, which were previously issued to board members, officers, employees and a consultant, as compared to $3.2 million in stock-based compensation in 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	Cash compensation-related expenses were $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.3 million, or 12%, from $2.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	The increase was primarily a result of annual salary increases and increased personnel during parts of 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Professional services for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $3.2 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 26%, over the $4.3 million incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Of professional services, legal fees totaled $1.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 44%, from $1.8 million incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	The decrease was mainly due to a reduction in international legal work and legal fees related to patent activity.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	Audit and accounting fees incurred in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 20%.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	Investor and public relations fees totaled $1.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 23%, from $1.3 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S5	The decrease is due to a reduction in non-deal roadshows and attending less investor-related conferences.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S6	Other consulting fees and other professional fees totaled $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 14%, from $0.7 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P36_S7	Other professional fees include human resources, finance and corporate consultants.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 67%, from $0.9 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to business development and investor relations activities, which were significantly reduced from 2015.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	Office and other administrative expenses include rent, depreciation, insurance, business taxes, dues and subscriptions and other office related expenses.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a result of the foregoing, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $38.8 million, compared to a net loss of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we had working capital of $25.0 million, comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million, short-term investments of $7.2 million and prepaid expenses and other of $1.0 million, offset by $0.9 million of accounts payable and $1.2 million of accrued expenses.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	A significant portion of the accounts payable and accrued expenses are due to work performed in relation to our phase 3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in PTSD.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we used approximately $37.3 million and $42.5 million of cash in operating activities, respectively, which represents cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	The decrease in cash outlays principally resulted from a reduction in clinical, non-clinical, manufacturing, medical research, and regulatory cost activities.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2016, net proceeds from financing activities were $20.5 million, predominately from the sale of our common stock and warrants.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	In the comparable 2015 period, approximately $47.7 million was raised through the sale of shares of common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S6	At December 31, 2015, we had cash of $19.2 million.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P39_S7	Our cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank deposit accounts and money market funds.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $16.6 million, predominately from the maturity of marketable securities, as compared to cash used for the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $24.2 million, of which $28.6 million related to the purchase of marketable securities, $0.1 million related to the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements and $0.1 million related to the purchase of an intangible asset, offset by maturities of marketable securities of $4.7 million.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	On March 30, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp., as representative of the several underwriters (collectively, the 2017 Underwriters ), relating to the issuance and sale of 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, in an underwritten public offering (the March 2017 Financing ).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The public offering price for each share of common stock was $4.45.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	We granted the 2017 Underwriters a 45-day (or as otherwise specified in the underwriting agreement) option to purchase up to an additional 270,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The March 2017 Financing closed on April 4, 2017.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The 2017 Underwriters purchased the shares at a seven percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of $0.6 million (or $0.31 per share).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	We also expect to incur offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $7.2 million.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	On April 13, 2017, the 2017 Underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 270,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million, net of an aggregate discount of $0.1 million (or $0.31 per share).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	On October 26, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc. ( Dawson ) relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 950,000 units ( Unit , and collectively, the Units ) at a public offering price of $5.50 per Unit in an underwritten public offering (the October 2016 Financing ).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Each Unit consisted of one share of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and a warrant to purchase one-half share of common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Because we are prohibited from issuing fractional shares, the warrants can only be exercised in lots of two, which means that each holder must exercise two warrants to receive one share of common stock, or an aggregate of 475,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	The warrants have an initial exercise price of $6.30 per share and have a term of five years.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the warrants.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	We also granted Dawson a 45-day option to purchase up to 142,500 additional shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to 71,250 shares of common stock, to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The October 2016 Financing closed on October 31, 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Dawson purchased the Units at an eight-percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of approximately $0.4 million (or $0.40 per Unit).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	Dawson also received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 47,361 shares of common stock, or approximately five percent of the total number of shares included in the Units.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	We received net proceeds from the October 2016 Financing of approximately $4.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses of approximately $0.6 million.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	Additionally, Dawson fully exercised the over-allotment option related to the warrants and purchased additional warrants to acquire 71,250 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $700.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	On June 15, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC and National Securities Corporation (collectively, the Underwriters ), relating to the issuance and sale of 500,000 shares of our common stock, in an underwritten public offering (the June 2016 Financing ).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The public offering price for each share of common stock was $20.00.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	We granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 75,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	The June 2016 Financing closed on June 21, 2016.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Underwriters purchased the shares at a seven percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of $0.7 million (or $1.40 per share).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	We also paid offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Unless otherwise terminated earlier, the Sales Agreement continues until all shares available under the Sales Agreement have been sold.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to additional clinical trials.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	We expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term, as we have taken certain measures to reduce costs in order to preserve cash to fund our ongoing Phase 3 HONOR study in military-related PTSD through at least the first interim analysis.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	We believe our existing cash and marketable securities are sufficient to fund our operating expenses and planned clinical trial through at least the next 12 months.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	We will need to obtain additional capital in order to fund future research and development activities.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	In February 2012, we approved the 2012 Incentive Stock Options Plan, which was amended and restated in February 2013 ( 2012 Plan ).

1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	The Board of Directors determined the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the options granted under the 2012 Plan.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option must have been at least 100% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant (or 110% for any shareholder that owned 10% or more of our common stock).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S5	The fair market value of the common stock was determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in a good faith.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S6	Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the 2012 Plan were not more than five years and the expiration period not more than ten years.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S7	We reserved 55,000 shares of our common stock for future issuance under the terms of the 2012 Plan.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P60_S8	All reserved shares under the 2012 Plan were subject to granted awards outstanding.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	The Board of Directors determined the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the grants under the 2014 Plan.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P61_S4	However, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may not have been less than 110% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10% or more shareholder and 100% of fair value for a grantee who was not a 10% shareholder.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P61_S5	The fair value of the common stock was determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in good faith.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Under the terms of the 2016 Plan, we may issue (1) stock options (incentive and nonstatutory), (2) restricted stock, (3) SARs, (4) RSUs, (5) other stock-based awards, and (6) cash-based awards.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The 2016 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 278,500 shares of common stock, which amount will be (a) reduced by awards granted under the 2014 Plan after December 31, 2015, and (b) increased to the extent that awards granted under the Plans are forfeited, expire or are settled for cash (except as otherwise provided in the 2016 Plan).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	In terms of calculating how many shares are reduced or increased based on activity under the Prior Plans after December 31, 2015, the calculation shall be based on one share for every one share that was subject to an option or SAR and 1.25 shares for every one share that was subject to an award other than an option or SAR.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	With respect to awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the 2016 Plan provides that, subject to adjustment as provided in the plan, no participant may, in any 12-month period (i) be granted options or SARs with respect to more than 75,000 shares of our common stock, (ii) earn more than 50,000 shares of our common stock under restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance awards and/or other share-based awards, or (iii) earn more than $5,000,000 under an award; provided, however, that each of these limitations shall be multiplied by two (2) with respect to awards granted to a participant during the first calendar year in which the participant commences employment with us or any of our subsidiaries.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	However, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may not be less than 110% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10% or more shareholder and 100% of fair value for a grantee who is not a 10% shareholder.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	We measure the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, based on a Binomial option pricing model using certain assumptions discussed in the following paragraph, and the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	Most stock options granted pursuant to the Plans typically vest 1/3rd 12 months from the date of grant and 1/36th each month thereafter for 24 months and expire ten years from the date of grant.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	In addition, we also issue performance-based options to executive officers, which options vest when the target parameters are met, subject to a one year minimum service period prior to vesting.

1430306_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P87_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	We outsource our research and development efforts and expense the related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and clinical research organizations and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	We account for trial expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	We determine accrual estimates that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	Our clinical trial accruals and prepaid assets are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of CROs and other third-party vendors.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P92_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We record an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	We recognized a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	Lessees (for capital and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S4	The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S5	Lessees may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P94_S6	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	In December 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-09, issued in March 2016, related to stock-based compensation.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	The new guidance simplifies the accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	In December 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to continue as a Going Concern, issued in August 2014.
1430306_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	ASU 2014-15 explicitly requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances.
1430306_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.

1430306_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	The financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1430306_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1430306_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company's primary efforts are devoted to conducting research and development of innovative pharmaceutical products to address public health challenges.
1430306_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.

1430306_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.

1430306_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1430306_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1430306_17_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible enhancements to controls and procedures.

1430306_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of PTSD, other central nervous system disorders and biodefense.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	In September 2016, we discontinued our fibromyalgia program in order to fully focus our resources on our PTSD program.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	In June 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, conditionally accepted the proposed trade name Tonmya for TNX-102 SL, for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	The FDA s final approval of Tonmya as a name for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD is subject to a, New Drug Application, or NDA, approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	A request for review of Tonmya as the proposed name for TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia has been withdrawn at the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, has granted the federal registration of the Tonmya mark.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our lead product candidate, Tonmya, or TNX-102 SL, a proprietary low-dose cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, sublingual tablet, designed for bedtime administration, is in Phase 3 development as a potential treatment for PTSD.

1430306_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Tonmya is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP for sublingual administration.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Tonmya employs a proprietary, Protectic protective eutectic formulation of CBP which enables rapid systemic exposure and increased bioavailability through transmucosal absorption.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	We are developing Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD under an effective Investigational New Drug application, or IND, cleared by the FDA in June 2014.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	Tonmya for PTSD was designated Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA in December 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	An estimated 8.6 million adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by hyperarousal, avoidance, emotional numbing, and sleep disturbances.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Antianxiety drugs, also called anxiolytics, are not approved for PTSD, but are commonly prescribed despite the recommendations against their use by many experts.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	Anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics are comprised of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs, which carry risks of tolerance and addiction and are also associated with potential serious side-effects, such as retrograde amnesia.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer s disease and held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in November 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	We expect to file an IND to support a Phase 2 efficacy study in March 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	An estimated 5.3 million people in the U.S suffer from Alzheimer s disease, with more than half that number expected to be affected by agitation.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Behavioral symptoms are a major clinical complication of Alzheimer s disease.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Sleep disturbances and agitation are common and co-morbid features of Alzheimer s disease.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	Agitation in Alzheimer s disease is associated with significant negative consequences for both patients as well as their caregivers.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	Development of agitation, or its worsening, is one of the most common reasons for patients having to transition to nursing homes and other long-term care settings.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for behavioral symptoms such as agitation and aggression which adversely affect the quality of life of both the patients and caregivers.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Off-label use of atypical anti-psychotic medications for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer s disease is a common practice, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and significant risks associated with their use in this population.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	The principal components of our strategy are to:
1430306_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Develop Tonmya for PTSD and TNX-102 SL for Other Indications .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	We currently are focusing on the development of Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Maximize the commercial potential of Tonmya .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	We plan to commercialize Tonmya for PTSD, either on our own or through collaboration with partners.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	We believe Tonmya can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	In the cases of Tonmya and TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the case of Tonmya, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our product candidates address disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies or have no approved treatment which represent large potential commercial market opportunities.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Background information on the disorders and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates is set forth below.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	PTSD is a chronic condition that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	Of those who experience significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S4	According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S5	As of 2012, there were approximately 638,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P26_S6	Based on March 2015 VHA data, more than 19% of military veterans involved in recent conflicts were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The medications currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and many have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Alzheimer s is a chronic neurodegenerative disease in which behavioral symptoms are a major clinical complication.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Sleep disturbances and agitation are common and co-morbid features of Alzheimer s disease.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Agitation, which includes emotional lability, restlessness, irritability, and aggression, is one of the most distressing and debilitating of these behavioral complications of Alzheimer s disease.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	Agitation is likely to affect more than half of the 5.3 million Americans who currently suffer from Alzheimer s disease, and this number is expected to nearly triple by 2050.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P28_S4	The presence of agitation nearly doubles the cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer s disease, and agitation is estimated to account for more than 12 percent of the $256 billion in healthcare and societal cost of associated with Alzheimer s disease for the year 2017 in the United States.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Agitation in Alzheimer s disease is associated with significant negative consequences for both patients as well as their caregivers.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Development of agitation, or its worsening, is one of the most common reasons for patients having to transition to nursing homes and other long-term care settings.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for behavioral symptoms such as agitation and aggression which affects the quality of life of both the patients and caregivers.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Off-label use of atypical anti-psychotic medications for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer s disease is a common practice, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and significant risks associated with their use in this population.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	We currently are focused on developing a portfolio of product candidates, including one product candidate in clinical development for registration in two indications.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	The following table summarizes our most advanced product candidates, for which we plan to complete the required clinical studies to support their NDA filings:
1430306_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Tonmya or TNX-102 SL is a proprietary sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	We are developing Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	We own all rights to Tonmya in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Excipients used in Tonmya are approved for pharmaceutical use.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The current Tonmya sublingual tablets contain 2.8 mg of CBP.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	For the treatment of PTSD, Tonmya, 5.6 mg (two 2.8 mg tablets) administered simultaneously at bedtime, is in Phase 3 development.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The active ingredient in Tonmya, is CBP, a serotonin-2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	In addition, Tonmya acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for PTSD, including the serotonin 2A, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H-1 receptors.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: FLEXERIL (5 mg and 10 mg oral immediate-release, or IR, tablet) and AMRIX (15 mg and 30 mg oral extended-release capsule).
1430306_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	The FLEXERIL brand of CBP IR tablet has been discontinued since May 2013.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	There are numerous generic versions of CBP IR tablets on the market.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	IR CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day IR CBP tablets.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We designed Tonmya to be administered once-daily at bedtime and intended for long-term use.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	We believe the selected dose of Tonmya and its pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, Tonmya results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral IR CBP tablets.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	It also showed that the sublingual route of administration, which largely bypasses the first pass metabolism that swallowed medications undergo, results in a higher plasma ratio of CBP to its main active metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	In clinical studies, Tonmya 2.8 mg and Tonmya 5.6 mg were generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported in these studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after Tonmya administration.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	We expect that any applications we submit to the FDA for approval of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for product candidates containing an active ingredient that is similar or identical to an already approved product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) NDA is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	Currently, we are pursuing the development of Tonmya for PTSD, for which Tonmya is in Phase 3 development.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	We believe that Tonmya and TNX-102 SL have the potential to provide clinical benefit to this and possibly other CNS (central nervous system) indications that are underserved by currently marketed products or have no approved treatment.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	On May 2, 2017, we were issued U.S. patent 9,636,408 Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride , which includes compositions of CBP and methods of manufacturing the eutectic.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	The Protectic protective eutectic and Angstro-Technology formulation claimed in the patent are important elements of our proprietary Tonmya or TNX-102 SL composition.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	The patent is expected to provide Tonmya or TNX-102 SL with U.S. market exclusivity until 2034.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Eutectic tablets containing CBP and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal s lattice.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	The distance between the molecular units is not changed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2034 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	On September 13, 2017, we were issued European patent 2,501,234 Methods and Compositions for Treating Symptoms Associated with PTSD Using Cyclobenzaprine .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	This patent recites the use of CBP for the treatment of PTSD, which covers the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD, since the active ingredient in Tonmya is CBP.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	The patent is expected to provide Tonmya with European market exclusivity until 2030 and may be extended based on the timing of the European marketing authorization of Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	On December 15, 2017 we were issued Japanese Patent No. 6259452, Compositions and Methods for Transmucosal Absorption, by the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) relating to the pharmacokinetic profile of Tonmya, or TNX-102 SL.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	On January 23, 2018, we were issued a Notice of Allowance from PTO for U.S. Patent Application 12/948,828, Methods and compositions for treating symptoms associated with PTSD using Cyclobenzaprine .
1430306_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	This patent protects the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD as well as its active ingredient CBP for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2030 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	This method of use patent for Tonmya extends upon previously granted patents related to the composition of matter (U.S. Patent No. 9,636,408) and the active ingredient in Tonmya (European Patent No. 2,501,234) as described above.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	On March 1, 2018, we received a Notice of Allowance from the JPO for Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-503239 Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride The allowed claims recite pharmaceutical compositions comprising the eutectics and methods of manufacturing these eutectic formulations.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	We are developing Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD under an effective IND application.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Tonmya for PTSD has been designated as Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 study of Tonmya in participants with military-related PTSD, which we refer to as the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using Tonmya to treat military-related PTSD at a dose of 2.8 mg or 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets).
1430306_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, or CAPS-5, between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	The CAPS-5 scale is a standardized structured clinician interview and is considered the gold standard in clinical research and regulatory approval for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	In the AtEase study, participants experienced their index trauma during military service in 2001 or later and had a baseline CAPS-5 score of 29 or higher, and were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to bedtime daily Tonmya 2.8 mg, Tonmya 5.6 mg, or placebo sublingual tablets for 12 weeks, respectively.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	The AtEase study was conducted at 24 U.S. centers and enrolled 231 participants in the modified intent-to-treat population.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	We reported topline results from the AtEase study in May 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	AtEase was adequately designed to evaluate whether a 2.8 mg dose would be efficacious, which would have provided an opportunity for this study to be used as one of the two pivotal efficacy studies required to support approval of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Although the 2.8 mg dose trended in the direction of a therapeutic effect, it did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	The 5.6 mg dose had a therapeutic effect as assessed by the CAPS-5 scale, which was statistically significant by MMRM with MI analysis (p-value = 0.031), even though this arm of the study, by design, included only approximately half the number of participants of the 2.8 mg and placebo arms.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Tonmya demonstrated a dose-effect on multiple efficacy and safety measurements in the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	In the AtEase study, Tonmya was well tolerated and the participant retention rate was 73% on placebo, 79% on Tonmya 2.8 mg and 84% on Tonmya 5.6 mg.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	Four distinct SAEs were reported in the study; three were in the placebo group, and one (proctitis/peri-rectal abscess) in the Tonmya arm, which was determined to be unrelated to Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	The most common not dose-related adverse events were mild and transient local administration site conditions and of these oral hypoaesthesia, or numbness, was the most frequent and occurred in 39% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 36% of the participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 2% of the participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S3	Oral paresthesia, or tingling, occurred in 16% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 4% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 3% of the participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S4	Glossodynia, or a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth, occurred in 3% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 6% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 1% of participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S5	Systemic adverse events that were potentially dose-related and occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose or placebo included: somnolence in 16% versus 6% of the participants receiving placebo; dry mouth in 16% versus 11% of the participants receiving placebo; headache in 12% versus 4% of the participants receiving placebo; insomnia in 6% versus 9% of the participants receiving placebo; sedation in 12% versus 1% of the participants receiving placebo; upper respiratory tract infection in 4% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo; abnormal dreams in 2% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo; and weight increase in 2% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P54_S6	For the participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose, the incidence of the most common systemic adverse events reported above were less frequent than participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose with the exception of insomnia, which was 8%.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Retrospective analysis of the AtEase study suggested that the subset of participants with CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher at baseline (80% of AtEase population) was equivalent to the population of PTSD subjects studied in prior FDA registration studies of paroxetine and sertraline using older versions of the CAPS.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	The effect size (Cohen s d ) of the PTSD symptom improvement by CAPS-5 in this subset, comparing Tonmya 5.6 mg with placebo, was larger at 0.53 than the effect size in the full set with CAPS-5 score of 29 or higher at baseline at 0.36.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	To confirm this efficacy evidence, our ongoing Phase 3 program enrolls participants with baseline CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	The beneficial effects of Tonmya 5.6 mg were preserved in the subgroup with PTSD from combat traumas (85% of AtEase population).
1430306_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	Also, continuing remission (i.e. satisfying remission criterion of CAPS-5 score less than 11 at both week 8 and week 12) was observed in 21% of participants receiving a 5.6 mg dose of Tonmya as compared to 5% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.02, logistic regression).
1430306_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	The AtEase study supported the hypothesized mechanism of sleep quality improvement, since additional retrospective analyses showed that in the CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher subset of participants, sleep improvement at week 4, measured by the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance instrument, predicted treatment response (by improvement in total CAPS-5 score without the sleep item) at week 12 in the Tonmya 5.6 mg group (p = 0.01, linear regression), whereas these measures were not related in placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Participants who completed the AtEase study were eligible to enroll into a 12-week open-label extension study with Tonmya 2.8 mg.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We conducted this open-label extension study to obtain additional safety information from participants in the AtEase Study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	The clinical phase of this open-label extension study is complete.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	Tonmya 2.8 mg was well tolerated for up to six months of treatment and no new safety signals were revealed in this open-label extension study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have commenced the HONOR study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of Tonmya in approximately 550 participants with military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	This study is an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	The study design is very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study, except there will be one planned interim analysis, or IA, and the involvement of the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, to review unblinded IA results.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	The IDMC will make a recommendation to continue as planned, to continue but increase the number of recruited participants or to stop for success.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	In addition, only one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) is being investigated and the entrance criterion is CAPS-5 33 in this Phase 3 study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	The IA will be conducted when approximately 50% (approximately 250 300 participants) of the initially planned participant enrollment is evaluable for efficacy.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	We received FDA acceptance of the Phase 3 HONOR study design in January of 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	The HONOR study is being conducted at approximately 40 U.S. sites.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	As in the case of the AtEase study, the primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study is the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	To obtain additional safety information from participants in the HONOR study, participants who completed the HONOR study are eligible to enroll into a 12-week open-label extension study with Tonmya 5.6 mg.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	This open-label extension study is ongoing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	A second, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of Tonmya 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) in approximately 550 PTSD participants may follow, if necessary.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	We expect this study to be conducted at approximately 40 U.S. sites.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	As in the case of the HONOR and AtEase studies, the primary efficacy endpoint of this second Phase 3 study will be the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	In addition to the ongoing 12-week open-label extension study for HONOR, we plan to conduct the registration-required open-label extension studies of Tonmya in participants who complete either the 12-week open-label extension study of HONOR study or the second PTSD Phase 3 study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	6- and 12-month safety exposure data from Tonmya 5.6 mg to support its registration for the treatment of PTSD as it is a chronic psychiatric condition.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Subsequent to reporting the Phase 2 AtEase study topline result, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in August 2016 to discuss the Phase 3 program required to support the registration of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD and the remaining data package for the NDA filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	As described below, the first Phase 3 stud, currently ongoing, is in participants with military-related PTSD and the second Phase 3 study, if needed, will be performed in participants suffering from PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was based on the preliminary clinical evidence of Tonmya 5.6 mg on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA in about six months instead of 10 months after submission and rolling submission of completed portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA s senior managers contributing significant guidance.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our Breakthrough Therapy development program.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	In March 2017, we held the Initial Cross-Disciplinary Breakthrough Therapy Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the opportunity to accelerate the development and submission of the Tonmya NDA for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, a single-study NDA approval could be possible based on statistically persuasive topline data from the ongoing HONOR study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	Additionally, due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of Tonmya, the FDA agreed that studies in assessing abuse and dependency potential of Tonmya are not required to support the Tonmya NDA filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	In June 2017, the FDA conditionally accepted the proposed trade name Tonmya for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	On September 7, 2017, we had a Breakthrough Therapy Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ( CMC ) guidance meeting with the FDA regarding the CMC data required to support the Tonmya NDA and commercial product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	We received the FDA formal minutes from that meeting in October 2017 that reflect our readiness to manufacture Tonmya commercial product at production scale if an NDA can be submitted based on the HONOR study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	This is critical to the successful launch of a potentially improved treatment option for PTSD patients, especially those with military-related PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	In principle, our proposed CMC data package to support Tonmya s NDA approval and commercial manufacturing plans was acceptable to the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or Agreed iPSP, is required for the initial NDA submission.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	We submitted a revised iPSP in the first quarter of 2017, which incorporated the FDA comments received on our iPSP submitted in the third quarter of 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	Additional comments from the FDA were received in second quarter of 2017 on our revised iPSP.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	We plan to submit an Agreed iPSP in the third quarter of 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P71_S4	A Final Pediatric Study Plan requirement will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the Tonmya NDA filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for PTSD and the long-term safety data (up to 15 months) on Tonmya 2.8 mg in a prior fibromyalgia program, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	We completed a Phase 1 bioequivalence study that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of a single-dose of Tonmya 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: (i) the facility used to produce Tonmya 2.8 mg tablets for the Phase 2 AtEase study; and (ii) the facility used to produce Tonmya 2.8.mg tablets for our clinical studies required to support the PTSD NDA submission and the to-be-marketed product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	This bioequivalence study demonstrated that the Tonmya 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at these two facilities were bioequivalent, supporting the use of the AtEase study to support the Phase 3 studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	We intend to seek FDA marketing approval for Tonmya or TNX-102 SL pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA using AMRIX extended-release or ER capsules (30 mg) as our reference listed drug, or RLD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	As agreed upon by the FDA, we have started to study Tonmya 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) in comparison to AMRIX 30 mg ER capsules in a randomized, open-label, parallel, multiple-dose bridging PK study to provide a systemic exposure bridge.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P74_S2	If the Tonmya initial dose and at steady state exposures are less than or comparable to the RLD maximum approved dose (30 mg) and the metabolic profile is similar to AMRIX, the results of this study will provide the necessary systemic exposure bridge of Tonmya to AMRIX.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P74_S3	The approval of Tonmya for PTSD NDA can thus rely on the safety findings (clinical and nonclinical) of the currently approved CBP drug products.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	To support the Tonmya product registration, a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, food-effect, comparative bioavailability study of Tonmya following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions and a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, dose-proportionality, comparative bioavailability study of a single dose Tonmya 2.8 mg vs 5.6 mg in healthy subjects under fasting conditions will be completed for the Tonmya NDA submission.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	The FDA has accepted our proposed nonclinical data package to support our PTSD NDA filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	In October 2016, we completed the six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of the active ingredient, CBP, in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S., if necessary.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	These chronic toxicity studies were requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the AMRIX approved prescribing information, or labeling, which is necessary to support the Tonmya or TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P76_S3	Due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of Tonmya, the FDA agreed that nonclinical study to assess CBP abuse and dependency potential is not required to support the Tonmya NDA filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	TNX-102 SL drug product for Phase 2 was manufactured in a small-scale cGMP facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	For the clinical trial materials for Phase 3 clinical and NDA required Phase 1 studies, and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	The product s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of the single-dose pharmacokinetic study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P77_S3	FDA has accepted our proposed CMC data package to support Tonmya s NDA approval and commercial manufacturing plans, reflecting our readiness to manufacture Tonmya commercial product at production scale.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	On November 6, 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed development of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer s disease.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	We received the formal minutes from that meeting in December 2017 that reflect that Tonix has the data needed to file an IND to support a Phase 2 study which can potentially be one of the pivotal efficacy studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	We plan to submit the TNX-102 SL IND for agitation in Alzheimer s disease in March 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including two pre-IND candidates, TNX-601, a daytime treatment for PTSD and TNX-801, a biologic vaccine product for the prevention of smallpox, as well as an IND candidate, TNX-301, a potential treatment for AUD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	TNX-601 is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate in the pre-IND stage of development for the treatment for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Currently there is no tianeptine-containing product approved in the U.S., but tianeptine sodium (amorphous) has been marketed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America for the treatment of depression since 1987.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	It is effective in various depressive states and also improves depression-associated anxiety and somatic complaints.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	We have discovered a novel oxalate salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Like CBP, tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants, but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the neuroplastic changes that are observed during periods of stress and corticosteroid use.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	It is a weak mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, but does not have significant affinity for other known neurotransmitter receptors.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	Due to its decades of use in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, tianeptine has an established safety profile.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	In addition to being used to treat depression, several published studies support the potential of tianeptine as an effective and safe therapy for patients with PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 is being developed for daytime usage as a first-line monotherapy for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P84_S3	Tianeptine s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	We intend to develop TNX-601 under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 has been initiated.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of horsepox virus, or HPXV, grown in cell culture.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	TNX-801 was synthesized by Professor David Evans and Dr. Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta, Canada in collaboration with us.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	Construction of an infectious horsepox virus vaccine from chemically synthesized DNA fragments.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	HPXV has protective vaccine activity in mice, using a model of lethal vaccinia infection.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	Discussions regarding vaccine manufacturing activities have been initiated to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P87_S3	We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for widespread immunization and for the U.S. strategic national stockpile.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P87_S4	Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique virulence properties that we believe may suggest lower toxicity and potential safety advantages over existing vaccinia-based vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the most efficient and appropriate investigational plan, e.g., the application of the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, or Animal Rule, or conducting active comparator studies using ACAM2000, the current licensed live vaccinia virus vaccine, to establish the safety and effectiveness evidence to support the licensure TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	In the 1970s, vaccination against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	In addition, 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity is expected under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S3	Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon receiving FDA licensure.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S4	However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S5	If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P89_S6	We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed-dose Combination Drug Product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P90_S3	At that meeting, the FDA advised us of the nonclinical studies required for this CDP IND application to support the initiation of the first-in-man study with TNX-301.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	We own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P91_S2	We plan to develop TNX-701 under the Animal Rule, which is applicable when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P91_S3	We expect significant reduction in development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P92_S3	Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P92_S4	Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance.

1430306_18_ITEM1_P141_S2	In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P141_S3	Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	An independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P142_S1	An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P142_S2	The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P143_S1	Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P147_S1	Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P148_S1	The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P150_S1	These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P151_S1	Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P151_S2	Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P151_S3	The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S1	An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S2	An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S3	The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S4	The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S5	In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P152_S6	Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P153_S0	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P153_S1	The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P153_S2	In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S0	After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S1	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S2	The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S3	Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S4	The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S5	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S6	In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P154_S7	Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P155_S0	There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P155_S1	We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for Tonmya for PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P155_S2	We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P156_S0	A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P156_S1	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P156_S2	A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P156_S3	Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P157_S0	The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant s drug and the reference drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P157_S1	In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P158_S1	As such, we plan to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P158_S2	The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for PTSD as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P158_S3	If the FDA determines that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA is not appropriate and that a full NDA is required for Tonmya, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for Tonmya could substantially and materially increase, and Tonmya might be less likely to be approved.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P158_S4	If the FDA requires a full NDA for Tonmya, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P158_S5	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for a safety reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated Tonmya 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P159_S1	With respect to every patent listed in the FDA s Orange Book, which is the FDA s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P159_S2	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P159_S3	If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P160_S0	If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P161_S0	The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P161_S1	However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P162_S0	Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2).
1430306_18_ITEM1_P162_S1	If the FDA s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P163_S0	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P163_S1	If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P163_S2	Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P164_S0	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P165_S0	The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P165_S1	This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P165_S2	However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7 years after the NCE approval date.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P165_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P165_S4	Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P166_S0	Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P167_S0	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P167_S1	Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P167_S2	Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P167_S3	Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P167_S4	This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P168_S0	NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P168_S1	They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P169_S0	On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P169_S1	FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation Breakthrough Therapy.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P169_S2	A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:
1430306_18_ITEM1_P170_S0	preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P171_S0	In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P171_S1	The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was submitted based on the preliminary clinical evidence of Tonmya on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P172_S0	Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P172_S1	The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA in about six months instead of 10 months after submission and rolling submission of completed portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA s senior managers contributing significant guidance.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P172_S2	The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our Breakthrough Therapy development program.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P173_S0	In 2016, the 21 st Century Cures Act, or Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P173_S1	One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P173_S2	The Act created a new priority review voucher program for material threat medical countermeasures.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P174_S0	The Act defines such countermeasures as drugs or vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P174_S1	The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, and botulism.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P175_S0	A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product application; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10-12 months to 6 months.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P175_S1	The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P175_S2	We intend to seek a priority review voucher for TNX-801 licensure as a material threat medical countermeasure.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P175_S3	However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P175_S4	If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P176_S0	Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P176_S1	Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P176_S2	In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P176_S3	The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P176_S4	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
1430306_18_ITEM1_P177_S0	complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P178_S0	In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P178_S1	There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P179_S0	Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P180_S0	The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P180_S1	The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P180_S2	In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S0	Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S1	Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S2	However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S3	Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S4	The position on a payor s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S5	Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P182_S6	Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our product candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P183_S0	Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P183_S1	Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P183_S2	The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P184_S0	In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P184_S1	Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S0	The FDCA is subject to routine legislative amendments with a broad range of downstream effects.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S1	In addition to new legislation, such as the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 or the FDASIA in 2012, Congress introduces amendments to reauthorize drug user fees and address emerging concerns every five years.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S2	We cannot predict the impact of these new legislative acts and their implementing regulations on our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S3	The programs established or to be established under the legislation may have adverse effects upon us, including increased regulation of our industry.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S4	Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S5	In addition, the FDA s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P185_S6	Additionally, the current legislative authority for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act expired in September 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P186_S0	The requirements and changes imposed by the legislation to reauthorize the act may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P186_S1	It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P187_S0	We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P188_S0	As of March 1, 2018, we had 14 full-time employees, of whom five hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P188_S1	We have nine employees dedicated to research and development.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P188_S2	Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P188_S3	We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies as well as part-time employees.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P189_S0	None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P190_S0	We lease the space for our principal executive offices, which are located at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022, and our telephone number is (212) 980-9155.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P190_S1	Our website addresses are www.tonixpharma.com, www.tonix.com, and www.krele.com.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P190_S2	We do not incorporate the information on our websites into this annual report, and you should not consider such information part of this annual report.
1430306_18_ITEM1_P191_S0	We were incorporated on November 16, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Tamandare Explorations Inc. On October 11, 2011, we changed our name to Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We are focused on product development, and we have not generated any revenues to date.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have incurred losses in each year of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These operating losses have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders equity.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We and our prospects should be examined in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by new and early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks include, among other things, the speed at which we can scale up operations, our complete dependence upon development of our product candidates that currently have no market acceptance, our ability to establish and expand our brand name, our ability to expand our operations to meet the commercial demand of our clients, our development of and reliance on strategic and customer relationships and our ability to minimize fraud and other security risks.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, nonclinical and CMC development, laboratory testing and clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and regulatory compliance activities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, preclinical and nonclinical testing, and clinical study activities increase.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, and might never generate revenues from the sale of products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; successfully commercializing our products; establishing a favorable competitive position; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Many of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We might not succeed at any of these undertakings.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our operations to date have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies of our clinical-stage product candidate, Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for Tonmya or any of our other product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or commercialized products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our financial condition has varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include other factors described elsewhere in this annual report and also include, among other things:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Accordingly, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our product candidates are novel and still in development.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates, all of which are still in development.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our drug development methods may not lead to commercially viable drugs for any of several reasons.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For example, we may fail to identify appropriate targets or compounds, our drug candidates may fail to be safe and effective in clinical studies, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue development efforts for our drug candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our drug candidates will require significant additional development, clinical studies, regulatory clearances and additional investment by us or our collaborators before they can be commercialized.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Further, we and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We currently have one product candidate, Tonmya, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of PTSD, and the success of our business currently depends on its successful development, approval and commercialization.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Any projected sales or future revenue predictions are predicated upon FDA approval and market acceptance of Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If projected sales do not materialize for any reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to continue operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As we have no approved products on the market, we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if at all.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	To date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next couple of years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are largely dependent on the success of our clinical-stage product candidate, Tonmya for PTSD, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Tonmya has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent or received marketing approval for this product candidate anywhere in the world.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The clinical development program for Tonmya for PTSD may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical studies fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective or a clinical program may be put on hold due to unexpected safety issues.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical study process.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any failure or delay in completing clinical studies or obtaining regulatory approvals for Tonmya for PTSD in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Successful development of our products is uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products, including: delays in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing, or manufacturing; failure to receive regulatory approvals; emergence of superior or equivalent products; inability to manufacture on its own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale; and failure to achieve market acceptance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because of these risks, our research and development efforts may not result in any commercially viable products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained or any approved products are not commercially successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Clinical studies required for our product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new pharmaceutical product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and effectiveness in humans.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To meet these requirements, we must conduct adequate and well controlled clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Conducting clinical studies is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per study.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting clinical studies may cause us to incur additional operating expenses.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The commencement and rate of completion of clinical studies may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of stable and qualified materials under cGMP, for use in clinical studies; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients; modification of clinical study protocols; changes in regulatory requirements for clinical studies; the lack of effectiveness during clinical studies; the emergence of unforeseen safety issues; delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical studies due to the ITB responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and government or regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The results from early clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Accordingly, even if we obtain positive results from early clinical studies, we may not be able to confirm the results in future clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	For example, in a Phase 3 trial for a product candidate for fibromyalgia, we were not able replicate the results we received from the Phase 2b trial for this product candidate, and as a result discontinued this program.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Clinical studies may not demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our clinical studies may be conducted in patients with CNS conditions, and in some cases, our product candidates are expected to be used in combination with approved therapies that themselves have significant adverse event profiles.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	During the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical events or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We cannot ensure that safety issues will not arise with respect to our product candidates in clinical development.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The failure of clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical studies would delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any change in, or termination of, our clinical studies could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Product candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities as drugs, subject to an NDA under the FDCA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The FDA applies the same standards for biologics, requiring an IND application, followed by a Biologic License Application, or BLA, prior to licensure.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Other products, such as vaccines, are also regulated under the Public Health Service Act.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	FDA has conflated the standards for approval of NDAs and BLAs so that they require the same types of information on safety, effectiveness, and CMCs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding United States regulation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product s safety and efficacy, and in the case of biologics also potency and purity, for each intended use.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The development and approval process takes many years, requires substantial resources, and may never lead to the approval of a product.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval may limit the indicated medical uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or may require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If we, our collaborators, or our CMOs fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and/or export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We do not have, and may never obtain, the regulatory approvals we need to market our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Following completion of clinical studies, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In responding to an NDA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose post-approval study and other commitments or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The FDA has established performance goals for review of NDAs or BLAs: six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	However, the FDA is not required to complete its review within these time periods.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Product sales in the United States may commence only when an NDA or BLA is approved.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	To date, we have not applied for or received the regulatory approvals required for the commercial sale of any of our products in the United States or in any foreign jurisdiction.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	None of our product candidates have been determined to be safe and effective, and we have not submitted an NDA or BLA to the FDA or an equivalent application to any foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	It is possible that none of our product candidates will be approved for marketing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, may adversely affect the successful commercialization of any drugs or biologics that we or our partners develop, may impose additional costs on us or our collaborators, may diminish any competitive advantages that we or our partners may attain, and/or may adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We have limited experience in completing a Phase 3 clinical study and have never submitted an NDA before, and may be unable to do so for Tonmya or other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We initiated a Phase 3 study in military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As this study is intended to provide efficacy and safety evidence to support marketing approval by the FDA, it is considered a pivotal, confirmatory or registration, study.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The conduct of pivotal clinical studies and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although members of our management team have extensive industry experience, including in the development and clinical testing of drug candidates and the commercialization of drug, we have conducted only one pivotal clinical study before (the AFFIRM study in fibromyalgia participants), have limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings, and have not submitted an NDA before.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete this planned clinical study in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of Tonmya and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical studies would prevent or delay commercialization of Tonmya and other product candidates we are developing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our product candidates may cause SAEs or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	SAEs or undesirable side effects from Tonmya or any of our other product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The results of future clinical studies, including Tonmya, may show that our product candidates cause SAEs or undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If Tonmya or any of our other product candidates cause SAEs or undesirable side effects or suffer from quality control issues:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If a competing drug shows efficacy in military-related PTSD prior to the FDA approval of Tonmya or if Tonmya fails to confirm the results of the AtEase Phase 2 study in showing activity in military-related PTSD in the Phase 3 HONOR study, then the FDA may rescind the Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In December 2016, the FDA granted Tonmya for PSTD Breakthrough Therapy designation based on several factors, including that Tonmya has the potential to be an improvement over existing therapies for military-related PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If another therapy is shown to be effective in military-related PTSD before FDA approval of Tonmya, then the FDA may rescind the designation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition, if Tonmya fails to confirm the activity from the AtEase study in treating military-related PTSD, then the FDA may rescind the Breakthrough Therapy designation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Breakthrough Therapy designation for Tonmya may not lead to faster development or regulatory processes nor does it increase the likelihood that Tonmya will receive marketing approval for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There is no guarantee that the receipt of Breakthrough Therapy designation will result in a faster development, review or approval process for Tonmya for PTSD or increase the likelihood that Tonmya will be granted marketing approval for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In some cases, the development program for the Breakthrough Therapy could be shorter than for other drugs intended to treat the disease being studied.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	However, the FDA notes that a compressed drug development program still must generate adequate data to demonstrate that the drug is safe, effective and meets the statutory standard for approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If a clinical development program granted Breakthrough Therapy designation does not continue to meet the criteria, the FDA may rescind the designation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Likewise, any future Breakthrough Therapy designation for any other potential indication of TNX-102 SL neither guarantees a faster development process, review or approval nor improves the likelihood of the granting of marketing approval by the FDA for any such potential indication of TNX-102 SL compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy designation for other of our product candidates, but the FDA may not grant this status to any of our proposed product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If we are unable to file for approval of Tonmya under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our current plans for filing NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates and therefore reduce the development time.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in October 2012 to discuss the development of Tonmya in PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Following the results of the AtEase Study, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in August 2016 to discuss our most advanced development program, in which we are developing Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S3	In March 2017, we had our initial Cross-disciplinary Breakthrough Therapy meeting with the FDA to discuss ways to expedite the development and NDA submission of Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Although our interactions with the FDA have encouraged our efforts to continue to develop Tonmya for PTSD, there is no assurance that we will satisfy the FDA s requirements for approval in this indication.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S5	The timeline for filing and review of our NDA for Tonmya for PTSD is based on our plan to submit this NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which would enable us to rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P51_S6	We have not yet filed an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result of the certification, the third-party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may not be able to realize a shortened development timeline for Tonmya for PTSD, and the FDA may not approve our NDA based on their review of the submitted data.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any safety reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for Tonmya, and we may need to fulfill the more extensive requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our lead product candidate.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Even if approved, our products will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Once a product is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted by the market.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept it or use it.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Even if physicians and patients would like to use our products, our products may not gain market acceptance among healthcare payors such as managed care formularies, insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug or device product; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	unfavorable publicity concerning our products or any similar products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Because we have limited financial and human resources, we are currently focusing on the regulatory approval of Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Our spending on existing and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm with an explanatory paragraph for the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	In their report dated March 9, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we have incurred losses since inception, have a negative cash flow from operations, and require additional financing to fund future operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If additional capital is not available or is available at unattractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In order to develop and bring our product candidates to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, preclinical and nonclinical testing, clinical studies and marketing activities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to maintain our current operations for at least the next 12 months.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	We anticipate using our cash and cash equivalents to fund further research and development with respect to our lead product candidate.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	We will, however, need to raise additional funding sooner if our business or operations change in a manner that consumes available resources more rapidly than we anticipate.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Our requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	In addition, if we obtain debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or curtail our operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	In addition, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or license rights to technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We will require substantial additional funds to support our research and development activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, regulatory approvals and eventual commercialization.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Such additional sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to commence or complete clinical studies or obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds needed to fund our business plan.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	If we are not able to raise sufficient capital in the near future, our continued operations will be in jeopardy and we may be forced to cease operations and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	On September 28, 2017, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $15,000,000 of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Upon the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 73,039 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as a fee for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The remaining shares of our common stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time through March 2020.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of our shares to Lincoln Park.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Additional sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some, or none of the additional shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	If and when we do sell shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We face intense competition in the markets targeted by our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our product candidates under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We expect that all of our product candidates under development, if approved, will face intense competition from existing and future drugs marketed by large companies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or cost less than our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Additionally, if a competitor receives FDA approval before we do for a drug that is similar to one of our product candidates, FDA approval for our product candidate may be precluded or delayed due to periods of non-patent exclusivity and/or the listing with the FDA by the competitor of patents covering its newly-approved drug product.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Periods of non-patent exclusivity for new versions of existing drugs such as our current drug product candidate, Tonmya, can extend up to three and one-half years.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	These activities would adversely affect our ability to commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	We compete with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing other forms of treatment for the same or similar indications we are pursuing and that have greater financial and other resources.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than us, obtaining FDA approval for products more rapidly, or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We face competition from companies that internally develop competing technology or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop competitive positions that may prevent, make futile, or limit our product commercialization efforts, which would result in a decrease in the revenue we would be able to derive from the sale of any products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be accepted by the marketplace as readily as these or other competing treatments.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Furthermore, if our competitors products are approved before ours, it could be more difficult for us to obtain approval from the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Even if our products are successfully developed and approved for use by all governing regulatory bodies, there can be no assurance that physicians and patients will accept our product(s) as a treatment of choice.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Furthermore, the pharmaceutical research industry is diverse, complex, and rapidly changing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	By its nature, the business risks associated therewith are numerous and significant.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P83_S2	The effects of competition, intellectual property disputes, market acceptance, and FDA regulations preclude us from forecasting revenues or income with certainty or even confidence.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs using our technologies and patents in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights and intellectual property rights in these and other countries.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We have received, and are currently seeking, patent protection for numerous compounds and methods of treating diseases.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents related to them.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	These risks and uncertainties include the following: patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide us any competitive advantage; our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and countries other than the United States may have less robust patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products using our technologies and patents.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Moreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent or narrow our patents.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Third parties may also independently develop products similar to our products, duplicate our unpatented products or design around any patents or propriety technologies on products we develop.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Additionally, extensive time is required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	While extensions of patent term due to regulatory delays may be available, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent, even with an extension, may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages to us of the patent.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	In addition, the PTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the innovations specifically exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our success depends on our patents and patent applications that may be licensed exclusively to us and other patents and patent applications to which we may obtain assignment or licenses.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our product candidates to us or our licensors, or by covering the same or similar technologies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P90_S2	These patents, patent applications, and published literature may limit the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Patent protection and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of present and future patents and other proceedings of our competitors.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Litigation may be necessary to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P95_S2	An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Competitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	Third parties may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable in these proceedings.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	Such litigation can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P96_S4	An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Third parties may also assert that our patents are invalid in patent office administrative proceedings.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	These proceedings include oppositions in the European Patent Office and inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the PTO.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P97_S2	The success rate of these administrative challenges to patent validity in the United States is higher than it is for validity challenges in litigation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Interference or derivation proceedings brought before the PTO may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to innovations disclosed in our patents or patent applications.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	During these proceedings, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Even if successful, an interference or derivation proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference or derivation proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P100_S2	An adverse decision in litigation or administrative proceedings could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	If we infringe the rights of third parties we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	If preclinical and nonclinical testing or clinical studies for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed, we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and outside consultants, to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies involving our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these preclinical and nonclinical testing activities and clinical studies than if we performed the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies on our anticipated schedule or, for clinical studies, consistent with a clinical study protocol.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Delays in preclinical and nonclinical testing, and clinical studies could significantly increase our product development costs and delay product commercialization.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P104_S4	In addition, many of the factors that may cause, or lead to, a delay in the clinical studies may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	The commencement of clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P106_S0	obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Once a clinical study has begun, it may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P108_S0	nonclinical or clinical safety observations, including adverse events and SAEs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P109_S0	If clinical studies are unsuccessful, and we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products, and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We rely on CROs and clinical study sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P111_S1	While we have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P111_S2	We will control only certain aspects of our CROs activities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P111_S3	Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA s cGCP for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical study participants are protected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators and clinical study sites.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P112_S2	If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical studies may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical studies before approving any marketing applications.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical studies did not comply with cGCPs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P112_S4	In addition, our clinical studies, including our ongoing Phase 3 HONOR study in military-related PTSD, will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P112_S5	Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of participants, our clinical studies may be delayed or we may be required to repeat such clinical studies, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our CROs are not our employees, and we are not able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P113_S1	These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P114_S0	If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P114_S1	As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for such product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P115_S0	We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for our clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P115_S1	Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We will need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P117_S0	As we advance our product candidates through preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and develop new product candidates, we will need to increase our product development, scientific, regulatory and compliance and administrative headcount to manage these programs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P117_S1	In addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we will need to increase our general and administrative capabilities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P117_S3	Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P118_S0	continue to improve our operational, manufacturing, quality assurance, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P119_S0	If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business, and our future success depends on our ability to retain them.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P121_S0	Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of Dr. Seth Lederman, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Gregory M. Sullivan, our Chief Medical Officer.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P121_S1	Dr. Lederman has overseen Tonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, since inception and provides leadership for our growth and operations strategy as well as being an inventor on many of our patents.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P121_S2	Dr. Sullivan has served as our Chief Medical Officer since 2014 and directed the Phase 2 AtEase study and is directing the Phase 3 HONOR study.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Loss of the services of Drs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P122_S1	Lederman or Sullivan would have a material adverse effect on our growth, revenues, and prospective business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P122_S2	The loss of any of our key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Any employment agreement we enter into will not ensure the retention of the employee who is a party to the agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P123_S1	In addition, we have only limited ability to prevent former employees from competing with us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P123_S2	Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P123_S3	We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P123_S4	Moreover, competition for personnel with the scientific and technical skills that we seek is extremely high and is likely to remain high.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P123_S5	Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P124_S0	If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Over time we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in drug development, product registration, clinical, preclinical and nonclinical research, quality compliance, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, financial matters and sales and marketing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P125_S1	We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P125_S2	Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P125_S3	Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P126_S0	We rely on third parties to manufacture the compounds used in our studies, and we intend to rely on them for the manufacture of any approved products for commercial sale.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P126_S1	If these third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P127_S0	We have no manufacturing facilities, and we have no experience in the clinical or commercial-scale manufacture of drugs or in designing drug manufacturing processes.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P127_S1	We intend to rely on CMOs to manufacture some or all of our product candidates in clinical studies and our products that reach commercialization.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P127_S2	Completion of our clinical studies and commercialization of our product candidates requires the manufacture of a sufficient supply of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P127_S3	We have contracted with outside sources to manufacture our development compounds, including Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P127_S4	If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical studies or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for nonclinical, preclinical, clinical, and commercial purposes.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P127_S5	Although we are in discussions with other manufacturers we have identified as potential alternative CMOs of Tonmya, we may not be successful in negotiating acceptable terms with any of them.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S0	We believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may be able to retain to produce these products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S1	However, once we retain a manufacturing source, if our manufacturers do not perform in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to develop or commercialize potential products as planned.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Certain specialized manufacturers are expected to provide us with modified and unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, including finished products, for use in our preclinical and nonclinical testing and clinical studies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S3	Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S4	Any interruption in or termination of service by such sole source suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S5	Any delay or interruption in manufacturing operations (or failure to locate a suitable replacement for such suppliers) could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, or results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S6	We do not have any short-term or long-term manufacturing agreements with many of these manufacturers.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S7	If we fail to contract for manufacturing on acceptable terms or if third-party manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our development programs could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S8	This may result in delays in filing for and receiving FDA approval for one or more of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P128_S9	Any such delays could cause our prospects to suffer significantly.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of clinical studies, the approval of any product candidates or the commercialization of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P130_S0	Such third-party manufacturers must be inspected by FDA for cGMP compliance before they can produce commercial product.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P130_S1	We may be in competition with other companies for access to these manufacturers facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P130_S2	If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance may be materially affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Manufacturers are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P131_S1	A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical studies, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution following FDA approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P131_S2	This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P132_S1	We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P132_S2	Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P132_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P132_S4	As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP requirements and other requirements under Federal drug laws, other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P133_S1	If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure by the government to grant marketing approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P134_S0	Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Our operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates is heavily dependent on our entering into collaborations with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S1	Our current strategy assumes that we will successfully establish these collaborations, or similar relationships; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful establishing such collaborations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S2	Some of our existing collaborations are, and future collaborations may be, terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S3	Replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S4	The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and may not be within our power to influence.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S5	There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from such collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S6	If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and may not be able to develop and market such products effectively, if at all.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P135_S7	In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P136_S0	Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading, or incomplete.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P137_S0	We rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical studies, and our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P137_S1	If such third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P138_S0	Our product candidates may face competition sooner than expected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S0	We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our product candidates provided under the FDCA and similar laws in other countries.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S1	We believe that TNX-801 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S2	Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product or BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S3	The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S4	The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing brand product.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S5	The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S6	While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for any of our product candidates that are biologics.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S7	There is also a risk that President Trump s administration could repeal or amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent protection.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S8	Although there is no current discussion of repeal or modification of the BPCIA, the future remains uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P139_S9	Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P140_S0	Our product candidates that are not, or are not considered, biologics that would qualify for exclusivity under the BPCIA may be eligible for market exclusivity as drugs under the FDCA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P141_S0	The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P142_S0	A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P142_S1	During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P142_S2	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P142_S3	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P142_S4	This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Even if, as we expect, our product candidates are considered to be reference products eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA or five years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full BLA or full NDA for such product containing the sponsor s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P143_S1	Moreover, an amendment or repeal of the BPCIA could result in a shorter exclusivity period for our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P144_S0	If we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties, we will not be able to create a market for our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Our strategy with our product candidates is to control, directly or through contracted third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, including marketing, sales and distribution.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P145_S2	In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P145_S3	The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P146_S0	To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P146_S1	These efforts may not be successful.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P146_S2	If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P147_S0	Sales of pharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P147_S1	Without the financial support of the government or third-party payors, the market for our products will be limited.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P147_S2	These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Recent proposals to change the health care system in the United States have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical products and services or subject the pricing of medical treatment products to government control.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P149_S1	Third-party payors may not reimburse sales of our products or enable our collaborators to sell them at profitable prices.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P150_S0	Our business strategy might involve out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P150_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P150_S2	To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third-parties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P150_S3	If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish and rely on our own in-house capabilities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P151_S0	We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P151_S1	To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P151_S2	The establishment of a marketing, sales, and distribution capability would significantly increase our costs, possibly requiring substantial additional capital.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P151_S3	In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we may not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P151_S4	There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P151_S5	If we are unable to, or choose not to establish these capabilities, or if the capabilities we establish are not sufficient to meet our needs, we will be required to establish collaborative marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Our relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors will be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P152_S1	If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P153_S1	Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other health care laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the law commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P153_S2	These laws will impact, among other things, our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P153_S3	In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct or may conduct our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P153_S4	The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P154_S0	state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P156_S0	It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P156_S1	If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P157_S0	The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P158_S1	Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P159_S0	The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our current or any future drug candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably, if approved.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S0	Market acceptance and sales of any drug candidates that we commercialize, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S2	Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S3	However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S4	One payor s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S5	Additionally, a third-party payor s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S6	Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S7	The position on a payor s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S8	Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P161_S9	Patients are unlikely to use our drugs unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P162_S0	A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P162_S1	Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P162_S2	We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P162_S3	Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any drug for which we obtain marketing approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P162_S4	If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our current and any future drug candidates that we develop.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Healthcare legislative reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P164_S0	In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P165_S0	Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P165_S1	In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P165_S2	In March 2010, the PPACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P165_S3	The PPACA, among other things: (i) addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (ii) increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (iii) establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; (iv) expands the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; and (v) establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P166_S0	In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the PPACA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P166_S1	The Budget Resolution is not a law, however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the PPACA.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P166_S2	Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P167_S0	The PPACA remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Recent efforts to repeal, modify or delay implementation of the ACA have resulted in some level of success.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P168_S1	If the PPACA is repealed or further modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the PPACA are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P168_S2	We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the PPACA on us at this time.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P168_S3	Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by CMS and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P169_S0	Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which will be fully implemented in 2019.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P169_S1	At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P169_S2	Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P170_S0	We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P171_S0	Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P172_S0	The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P173_S0	We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P174_S0	If we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P175_S0	If Tonmya or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercialization outside of the United States, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P175_S1	We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P176_S0	difficulty in importing and exporting clinical study materials and study samples.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P177_S0	We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S0	Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S1	If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators drugs harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical study participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S2	Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S3	While we currently carry clinical study insurance and product liability insurance, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S4	We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S5	If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S6	If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P178_S7	A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause our stock price to fall.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P179_S0	We use hazardous chemicals in our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P179_S1	Potential claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these chemicals could affect us and be time consuming and costly.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P180_S0	Our research and development processes and/or those of our third party contractors may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P180_S1	These hazardous chemicals are reagents and solvents typically found in a chemistry laboratory.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P180_S2	Our operations also produce hazardous waste products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P181_S0	Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P181_S1	While we attempt to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the outsourcing of the disposal of all hazardous chemicals and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination from or discharge of hazardous materials and any resultant injury.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P181_S2	In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P182_S0	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P182_S1	Current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P182_S2	We might have to pay civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P182_S3	We are not insured against these environmental risks.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P183_S0	If we enter into collaborations with third parties, they might also work with hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P183_S1	We may agree to indemnify our collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P184_S0	In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P185_S0	Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P186_S0	We carry insurance for most categories of risk that our business may encounter, however, we may not have adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P186_S1	We currently maintain general liability, clinical study, property, workers compensation, products liability and directors and officers insurance, along with an umbrella policy, which collectively costs approximately $600,000 per annum.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P186_S2	We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to maintain existing insurance at current or adequate levels of coverage.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P186_S3	Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P187_S0	If we retain collaborative partners and our partners do not satisfy their obligations, we will be unable to develop our partnered product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S0	In the event we enter into any collaborative agreements, we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our collaborative partners with respect to any of these product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S1	Any collaborative partner may not fulfill its obligations under these agreements.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S2	If a collaborative partner fails to fulfill its obligations under an agreement with us, we may be unable to assume the development of the products covered by that agreement or enter into alternative arrangements with a third party.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S3	In addition, we may encounter delays in the commercialization of the product candidate that is the subject of the agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S4	Accordingly, our ability to receive any revenue from the product candidates covered by these agreements will be dependent on the efforts of our collaborative partner.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S5	We could also become involved in disputes with a collaborative partner, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and commercialization programs and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S6	In addition, any such dispute could diminish our collaborators commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to developing and commercializing our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S7	Conflicts or disputes with our collaborators, and competition from them, could harm our relationships with our other collaborators, restrict our ability to enter future collaboration agreements and delay the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S8	If any collaborative partner terminates or breaches its agreement, or otherwise fails to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing these product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S9	We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us, or at all.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P188_S10	Our inability to enter into collaborative arrangements with collaborative partners, or our failure to maintain such arrangements, would limit the number of product candidates that we could develop and ultimately, decrease our sources of any future revenues.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P189_S0	We may be unsuccessful in obtaining a priority review voucher for material threat medical countermeasures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P190_S0	In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P190_S1	One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P190_S2	The Act created a new priority review voucher program for material threat medical countermeasures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P191_S0	The Act defines such countermeasures as drugs or vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P191_S1	The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, and botulism.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P192_S0	A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10-12 months to 6 months.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P192_S1	The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P193_S0	We intend to seek a priority review voucher for TNX-801 as a material threat medical countermeasure.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P193_S1	However, the structure of voucher programs limits the number of medical countermeasures eligible for a priority review voucher.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P193_S2	Further, the medical countermeasure must qualify for priority review in order to be eligible and may not include any commercially approved indication.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P193_S3	Moreover, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P193_S4	If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P193_S5	As such, the market for the TNX-801 will be limited if we are successful in obtaining a priority review voucher, assuming that the Priority Review Voucher Program is in effect at the time TNX-801 is available for licensing.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P194_S0	There may not be market interest in TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P195_S0	The government is the only market for most medical countermeasures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P195_S1	This is because unlike other drugs and vaccines, these products are not sold to doctors, hospitals, or pharmacies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P196_S0	The BioShield Special Reserve Fund, or SRF, has been the sole medical countermeasures market for the last decade; a 10 year advance appropriation of $5.6 billion was available to procure successful candidate medical countermeasures.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P196_S1	The SRF expired in 2013 and all funds were used to add 12 new medical countermeasures to the national stockpile.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P196_S2	Congress reauthorized the SRF but adequate funding has not yet followed; the SRF is now appropriated annually and has not kept pace with the need for purchasing products ready for stockpiling.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P196_S3	Further, similar products are being developed by other companies, such as Bavarian Nordic, which is developing Modified Virus Ankara, or MVA, which may compete with TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P196_S4	As such, even if TNX-801 were to receive FDA licensure, the commercial success of TNX-801 remains uncertain.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P197_S0	If technology developed for the purposes of developing new medicines or vaccines can be applied to the creation or development of biological weapons, then our technology may be considered dual use technology and be subject to limitations on public disclosure or export.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P198_S0	Together with the University of Alberta, we are consulting with government authorities before publishing work that describes the synthesis of poxviruses, including TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P198_S1	Our research collaboration is dedicated not only to creating tools that better protect public health but also to safeguarding any information with broad, dual-use potential that could be inappropriately applied.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P199_S0	Dual use research is research conducted for legitimate purposes that generates knowledge, information, technologies, and/or products that can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat to public health, agricultural crops, or national security.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P199_S1	Because variola, the agent that causes smallpox, is a pox virus, the technology we created could be considered dual use and could be subject to export control, for example under the Wassenaar Arrangement.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P199_S2	Further, if federal authorities determine that our research is subject to institutional oversight, we will need to implement a risk-management plan developed in collaboration with the institutional review entity.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P199_S3	Failure to comply with the plan may result in suspension, limitation, or termination of federal funding or loss of future federal funding opportunities for any of our or the University of Alberta s research.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P200_S0	We face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P201_S0	We face a number of risks in connection with our current collaborations, including the University of Alberta.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P201_S1	Our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P201_S2	Our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively assist in the development of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P201_S3	Any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P201_S4	Further, disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the preferred course of development, might cause delays, might result in litigation or arbitration, or might result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P201_S5	Any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and costly.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P202_S0	We face risks in connection with the production and storage of the TNX-801 vaccine.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P203_S0	The TNX-801 vaccine candidate is a live form of HPXV.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P203_S1	We have initiated vaccine-manufacturing activities to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P204_S0	While it is potentially safer and possibly better tolerated than existing smallpox-preventing vaccines, the production and storage of the synthesized HPXV virus stock may carry risk of infection and harm to individuals.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P205_S0	HPXV, an equine disease caused by a virus and characterized by eruptions in the mouth and on the skin, is believed to be eradicated.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P205_S1	No true HPXV outbreaks have been reported since 1976, at which time the United States Department of Agriculture obtained the viral sample used for the sequence published in 2006 that allowed the synthesis of TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P206_S0	Sales of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P207_S0	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale, by us or others, including the issuance of common stock upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P207_S1	We and our directors and officers may sell shares into the market, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P208_S0	The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P209_S0	The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P209_S1	The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P209_S2	This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P210_S0	The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P211_S0	the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P212_S0	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P212_S1	Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P213_S0	We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P214_S0	We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P214_S1	The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P214_S2	You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P214_S3	The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P214_S4	There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P215_S0	We expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P216_S0	Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P216_S1	These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P216_S2	The nature of our business involves variable factors, such as the timing of the research, development and regulatory pathways of our product candidates, which could cause our operating results to fluctuate.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P217_S0	Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P218_S0	The rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P219_S0	Our articles of incorporation give our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P219_S1	As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P219_S2	Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P220_S0	The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P221_S0	Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create a series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P222_S0	If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P223_S0	If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P224_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P224_S1	If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P224_S2	Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P224_S3	If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P225_S0	Because certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P226_S0	As of March 1, 2018, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (those beneficially owning in excess of 5%), and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 20.33% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P226_S1	As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P226_S2	In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P226_S3	Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P227_S0	discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P228_S0	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P229_S0	The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P229_S1	Our research coverage by industry and financial analysts is currently limited.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P229_S2	Even if our analyst coverage increases, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P229_S3	If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P230_S0	Other companies may have difficulty acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, due to provisions under our corporate charter and bylaws, as well as Nevada law.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P231_S0	Provisions in our articles of incorporation, our bylaws, and under Nevada law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P231_S1	Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party:
1430306_18_ITEM1A_P232_S0	We are also subject to provisions of Nevada law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns 10 percent or more of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of time after the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors and stockholders.
1430306_18_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved staff comments at December 31, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We maintain our principal office at 509 Madison Avenue, Suite 306, New York, New York 10022.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our telephone number at that office is (212) 980-9155 and our fax number is (212) 923-5700.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	On February 11, 2014, we entered into a lease amendment and expansion agreement, whereby we agreed to lease additional premises for office space, commencing May 1, 2014 and expiring on April 30, 2019.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	In connection therewith, we executed a letter of credit, which has a remaining balance of $89,040 as of December 31, 2017, and we deposited such amount into the restricted cash account maintained at the bank that issued the letter of credit.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Including the additional premises, the total square footage of our principal office space is approximately 4,800.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	On April 28, 2014, we entered into a lease for approximately 3,578 square feet of office space in San Jose, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2014 and expiring on October 31, 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $44,546.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P2_S2	During December 2016, in an effort to reduce operating costs, we exited this facility and terminated this lease.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P2_S3	The total costs associated with exiting this facility were $0.1 million.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	On June 19, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 2,450 square feet of office space in Dublin, Ireland, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing June 1, 2015 and expiring on May 31, 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	During August 2017, in an effort to reduce operating costs, we terminated this lease and exited the premises in November 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	On July 27, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 132 square feet of office space in Montreal, Canada, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing August 1, 2015 and expiring on July 31 on an annual renewal basis.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P4_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $800.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	On August 24, 2015, we entered into a lease for approximately 2,762 square feet of office space in San Diego, California, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing September 1, 2015 and expiring on August 31, 2019.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P5_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $11,272.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P6_S0	On August 22, 2017, we entered into a lease for approximately 450 square feet of office space in Dublin, Ireland, whereby we agreed to lease premises, commencing November 20, 2017 and expiring on November 30, 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P6_S1	In connection therewith, we paid a security deposit of $7,067.
1430306_18_ITEM2_P7_S0	Future minimum lease payments are as follows (in thousands):
1430306_18_ITEM2_P8_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current business requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1430306_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
1430306_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol TNXP .
1430306_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, after giving effect to the 1-for-10 reverse stock split, which was effected on March 17, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	On March 7, 2018, the closing sale price of our common stock, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, was $3.59 per share.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 7, 2018, there were 106 holders of record of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements of our business.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table summarizes information about our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	We did not purchase any of our registered securities during the period covered by this Annual Report.
1430306_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	Not required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect Management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may will, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and continue, or similar words.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based and should be read together with the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly those under Risk Factors. .
1430306_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Tonix is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing pharmaceutical products to treat serious neuropsychiatric conditions and to improve biodefense through the development of potential medical counter-measures.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our most advanced drug development program is focused on delivering a safe and effective long-term treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	PTSD is characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of PTSD, other central nervous system disorders and biodefense.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	In June 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, conditionally accepted the proposed trade name Tonmya for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The FDA s final approval of Tonmya as a name for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD is subject to an New Drug Application, or NDA, approval.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	A request for review of Tonmya as the proposed name for TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia has been withdrawn at the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, has granted the federal registration of the Tonmya mark.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our lead product candidate, Tonmya or TNX-102 SL, a proprietary low-dose cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, sublingual tablet, designed for bedtime administration, is in Phase 3 development as a potential treatment for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	TNX-102 SL is also being developed as a treatment for agitation in Alzheimer s disease, or AAD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	The FDA has designated Tonmya a Breakthrough Therapy for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our therapeutic strategy in PTSD is supported by results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 study of Tonmya in participants with military-related PTSD, which we refer to as the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We reported topline results from the AtEase study in May 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	In the AtEase study, participants experienced their index trauma during military service in 2001 or later and had a baseline Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, or CAPS-5, score of 29 or higher and were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to Tonmya 2.8 mg, Tonmya 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets), or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks, respectively.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	This study was conducted at 24 U.S. centers and enrolled 231 participants in the modified intent-to-treat population.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	The primary objective of the AtEase study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tonmya in the treatment of military-related PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by CAPS-5 between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	The CAPS-5 scale is a standardized structured clinician interview and is considered the gold standard in clinical research and regulatory approval for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	AtEase was adequately designed to evaluate whether a 2.8 mg dose would be efficacious, which would have provided an opportunity for this study to be used as one of the two pivotal efficacy studies required to support approval of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Although the 2.8 mg dose trended in the direction of a therapeutic effect, it did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	The 5.6 mg dose had a therapeutic effect as assessed by the CAPS-5 scale, which was statistically significant by MMRM with MI analysis (p-value = 0.031), even though this arm of the study, by design, included only approximately half the number of participants of the 2.8 mg and placebo arms.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Tonmya demonstrated a dose-effect on multiple efficacy and safety measurements in the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	In the AtEase study, Tonmya was well tolerated and the participant retention rate was 73% on placebo, 79% on Tonmya 2.8 mg and 84% on Tonmya 5.6 mg.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Four distinct SAEs were reported in the study; three were in the placebo group, and one (proctitis/peri-rectal abscess,) in the Tonmya arm, which was determined to be unrelated to Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	The most common not dose-related adverse events were mild and transient local administration site conditions and of these oral hypoaesthesia, or numbness, was the most frequent and occurred in 39% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 36% of the participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 2% of the participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	Oral paresthesia, or tingling, occurred in 16% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 4% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 3% of the participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	Glossodynia, or a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth, occurred in 3% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 6% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 1% of participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Systemic adverse events that were potentially dose-related and occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose or placebo included: somnolence in 16% versus 6% of the participants receiving placebo; dry mouth in 16% versus 11% of the participants receiving placebo; headache in 12% versus 4% of the participants receiving placebo; insomnia in 6% versus 9% of the participants receiving placebo; sedation in 12% versus 1% of the participants receiving placebo; upper respiratory tract infection in 4% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo; abnormal dreams in 2% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo; and weight increase in 2% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	For the participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose, the incidence of the most common systemic adverse events reported above were less frequent than participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose with the exception of insomnia, which was 8%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Retrospective analysis of the AtEase study suggested that the subset of participants with CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher at baseline (80% of AtEase population) was equivalent to the population of PTSD subjects studied in prior FDA registration studies of paroxetine and sertraline using older versions of the CAPS.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The effect size (Cohen s d ) of the PTSD symptom improvement by CAPS-5 in this subset, comparing Tonmya 5.6 mg with placebo, was larger at 0.53 than the effect size in the full set with CAPS-5 score of 29 or higher at baseline, 0.36.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	To confirm this efficacy evidence, our ongoing Phase 3 program is enrolling participants with baseline CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	The beneficial effects of Tonmya 5.6 mg were preserved in the subgroup with PTSD from combat traumas (85% of AtEase population).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Also, continuing remission (i.e. satisfying remission criterion of a CAPS-5 score less than 11 at both week 8 and week 12) was observed in 21% of participants in the Tonmya 5.6 mg group as compared to 5.2% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.02, logistic regression).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	The AtEase study supported the hypothesized mechanism of sleep quality improvement, since additional retrospective analyses showed that in the subset of participants with CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher, sleep improvement at week 4, measured by the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance instrument, predicted treatment response (by improvement in total CAPS-5 score without the sleep item) at week 12 in the Tonmya 5.6 mg group (p = 0.01, linear regression).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	On December 16, 2016, the FDA designated Tonmya a Breakthrough Therapy for the treatment of PTSD based on data derived from a population with military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We received FDA agreement of the first Phase 3 study design in January 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	We commenced the HONOR study, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of Tonmya in approximately 550 participants with military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	This study is an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	The study design is very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study, except there will be one unblinded interim analysis, or IA, and the involvement of the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, to review unblinded IA results.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	The IDMC will make a recommendation to continue as planned, to continue but increase the number of recruited participants or to stop for success.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P15_S5	In addition, only one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) is investigated and the entrance criterion is CAPS-5 33 in this Phase 3 study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The IA will be conducted when approximately 50% of the initially planned participants (approximately 275 participants) are randomized.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The HONOR study is being conducted at approximately 40 U.S. sites.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	As in the case of the AtEase study, the primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study is the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with Tonmya 5.6 mg and those receiving placebo.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	At the Initial Cross-disciplinary Breakthrough Therapy meeting on March 9, 2017, the FDA confirmed that a single-study NDA approval is possible if the topline data of the Phase 3 HONOR study is statistically persuasive and no additional abuse and dependency study is necessary to support the NDA filing.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	On May 2, 2017, we were issued U.S. patent 9,636,408 Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride , which includes compositions of cyclobenzaprine HCl and methods of manufacturing the eutectic.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Protectic protective eutectic and Angstro-Technology formulation claimed in the patent are important elements of our proprietary Tonmya composition.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	The patent is expected to provide Tonmya with U.S. market exclusivity until 2034.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	On September 7, 2017, we had a Breakthrough Therapy Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ( CMC ) guidance meeting with the FDA regarding the CMC data required to support the Tonmya NDA and commercial product.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	We received the FDA formal minutes from that meeting in October 2017 that reflect our readiness to manufacture Tonmya commercial product at production scale if a single-study NDA can be submitted based on the HONOR study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	This is critical to the successful launch of a potentially improved treatment option for PTSD patients, especially those with military-related PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	In principle, our proposed CMC data package to support Tonmya s NDA approval and commercial manufacturing plans was acceptable to the FDA.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	On September 13, 2017, we were issued European patent 2,501,234 Methods and Compositions for Treating Symptoms Associated with PTSD Using Cyclobenzaprine .
1430306_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	This patent recites the use of CBP for the treatment of PTSD, which covers the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD, since the active ingredient in Tonmya is CBP.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	The patent is expected to provide Tonmya with European market exclusivity until 2030 and may be extended based on the timing of the European marketing authorization of Tonmya for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	On November 6, 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed development of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of Agitation in Alzheimer s Disease.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	We received the formal minutes from that meeting in December 2017 that reflect that Tonix has the data needed to file an IND to support a potentially pivotal efficacy study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	We plan to submit the TNX-102 SL IND for agitation in Alzheimer s disease by the end of March 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	On December 15, 2017 we were issued Japanese Patent No. 6259452, Compositions and Methods for Transmucosal Absorption, by the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) relating to the pharmacokinetic profile of Tonmya, or TNX-102 SL.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	On January 23, 2018, we were issued a Notice of Allowance from PTO for U.S. Patent Application 12/948,828, Methods and compositions for treating symptoms associated with PTSD using Cyclobenzaprine .
1430306_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	This patent protects the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD as well as its active ingredient CBP for the treatment of PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2030 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	This method of use patent for Tonmya extends upon previously granted patents related to the composition of matter (U.S. Patent No. 9,636,408) and the active ingredient in Tonmya (European Patent No. 2,501,234) as described above.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	On March 1, 2018, we received a Notice of Allowance from the JPO for Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-503239 Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride The allowed claims recite pharmaceutical compositions comprising the eutectics and methods of manufacturing these eutectic formulations.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including two pre-IND candidates, TNX-601 (tianeptine oxalate) for PTSD and TNX-801, a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine, an IND candidate, TNX-301, a potential treatment for AUD, and TNX-701, a biodefense development program for protection from radiation injury.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	TNX-601 is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate in the pre-IND stage of development for the daytime treatment for PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	We have discovered a novel salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 is being developed as a first-line monotherapy for PTSD for daytime use.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Tianeptine s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than Tonmya.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	On April 19, 2016, we were issued U.S. patent 9,314,469 B2 Method for treating neurocognitive dysfunction which includes using tianeptine for cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	We intend to develop TNX-601 under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential daytime treatment for PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 has been initiated.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of HPXV grown in cell culture.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Professor David Evans and Dr. Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta, Canada in collaboration with us, synthesized the HPVX, which demonstrated protective vaccine activity in mice, using a model of lethal vaccinia infection (Noyce RS, et.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for widespread immunization and for the U.S. strategic national stockpile.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique virulence properties that we believe may suggest lower toxicity and potential safety advantages over existing vaccinia-based vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the most efficient and appropriate investigational plan, e.g., the application of the Animal Rule, or conducting active comparator study using ACAM2000, to establish the safety and effectiveness evidence to support the licensure TNX-801.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	In the 1970s, vaccination against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	In addition, 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity is provided under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	It is unknown if a replacement for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, if enacted, would contain the 12-year exclusivity provision.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon FDA approval.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	TNX-301 is a fixed-dose CDP containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	At that meeting, the FDA advised us the nonclinical studies required for this CDP IND application to support the initiation of the first-in-man study with TNX-301.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	We plan to develop TNX-701 under the Animal Rule.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	We expect significant reduction in development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing Tonmya for PTSD, but we also expend effort on our other pipeline programs, including TNX-601, TNX-801 and TNX-301.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Our research and development expenses consist of manufacturing work and the cost of drug ingredients used in such work, fees paid to consultants for work related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy and safety of our drugs.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity, and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	We expect that all of our research and development expenses in the near-term future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	We test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and efficacy.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	At the appropriate time, subject to the approval of regulatory authorities, we expect to conduct early-stage clinical trials for each drug candidate.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	We anticipate funding these trials ourselves, and possibly with the assistance of federal grants, contracts or other agreements.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors, including lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, slower than expected participant recruitment, lack of funding or government delays.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates, perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately estimate the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials or a determination by the FDA that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval, insofar as cash in-flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $13.3 million, a decrease of $15.2 million, or 53%, from $28.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	This decrease is predominately due to the discontinuation of development work related to the episodic tension-type headache and fibromyalgia programs.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2017, we incurred $7.9 million, $0.3 million and $1.3 million in clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing, respectively, as compared to $16.4 million, $1.4 million and $3.3 million in 2016, respectively.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Costs related to product development decreased to $0 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 100%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in active clinical trials.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Compensation-related expenses decreased to $2.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, from $4.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 53%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	Cash compensation-related expenses were $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 53%, from $3.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	The decrease was primarily a result of personnel decreases during 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	We incurred $0.4 million in stock-based compensation in connection with the vesting of stock options in 2017, which were previously issued to officers and consultants, as compared to $0.9 million in stock-based compensation in 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P44_S4	Regulatory and legal costs decreased to $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, from $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 31%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P44_S5	The decrease in regulatory and legal costs is primarily due to the reduction in active trials.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs increased to $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, from $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.1 million, or 20%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to clinical development, including investigator meetings and medical-related conferences.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	Such activities increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 related to recruitment for the ongoing Honor study.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P45_S3	Other research and development costs were $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, after offsetting an insurance refund received of $0.2 million, from $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 75%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P45_S4	The decrease is primarily a result of lower insurance expense as a result of having fewer active trials, as well as lower rent and office-related expenses due to the closure of our San Jose facility.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P45_S5	Other research and development costs include rent, insurance and other office-related expenses.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.0 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 23%, from $10.4 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in personnel and professional services.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Compensation-related expenses decreased to $3.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, from $5.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 37%.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	We incurred $1.4 million in stock-based compensation in connection with the employee stock purchase plan and the vesting of restricted stock units and stock options in 2017, which were previously issued to board members, officers, employees and a consultant, as compared to $2.3 million in stock-based compensation in 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Cash compensation-related expenses were $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 34%, from $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	The decrease was primarily a result of personnel decreases during 2017 and 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Professional services for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $3.0 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 6%, over the $3.2 million incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Of professional services, legal fees totaled $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.1 million, or 10%, from $1.0 million incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	The increase was mainly due to SEC filings during 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Audit and accounting fees incurred in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 both amounted to $0.6 million.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	Investor and public relations fees totaled $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 50%, from $1.0 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in external investor and public relations activities as most of these roles were moved internally.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	Other consulting fees and other professional fees totaled $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.2 million, or 33%, from $0.6 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S7	Other professional fees include human resources, finance and corporate consultants.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P48_S8	The increase in primarily driven by additional spend on corporate consultants.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Travel, meals and entertainment costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 40%, from $0.5 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Travel, meals and entertainment costs include travel related to business development and investor relations activities, which were significantly reduced from 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Office and other administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.4 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 7%, from $1.5 million incurred in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	Office and other administrative expenses include rent, depreciation, insurance, business taxes, dues and subscriptions and other office related expenses, which were reduced from 2016 due to less personnel.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	As a result of the foregoing, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21.1 million, compared to a net loss of $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $24.3 million, comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $25.5 million and prepaid expenses and other of $0.9 million, offset by $1.3 million of accounts payable and $0.8 million of accrued expenses.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	A significant portion of the accounts payable and accrued expenses are due to work performed in relation to our phase 3 clinical trial of Tonmya in PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we used approximately $19.1 million and $37.3 million of cash in operating activities, respectively, which represents cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	The decrease in cash outlays principally resulted from a reduction in clinical, non-clinical, manufacturing and regulatory cost activities.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2017, net proceeds from financing activities were $18.5 million, predominately from the sale of our common stock and warrants.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	In the comparable 2016 period, approximately $20.5 million was raised through the sale of shares of common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $7.2 million and $16.5 million, respectively, both predominately related to the maturity of marketable securities.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	We believe that our cash resources will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through the end of 2018, but we not have enough resources to meet our operating requirements for the one-year period from the date of filing of this Form 10-K .
1430306_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We continue to face significant challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, our available capital resources may be consumed more rapidly than currently expected due to changes we may make in our research and development spending plans.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the one year period from the date of filing of this Form 10-K. We have the ability to obtain additional funding through public or private financing or collaborative arrangements with strategic partners to increase the funds available to fund operations.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our research and development activities, or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	If any of these events occurs, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	On September 28, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) and a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement ) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park has agreed to purchase from us up to $15,000,000 of our common stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares that have been or may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, at the time we signed the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, we issued 73,039 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The commitment shares were valued at $300,000, recorded as an addition to equity for the issuance of the common stock and treated as a reduction to equity as a cost of capital to be raised under the Purchase Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Under the Purchase Agreement, on any business day selected by us, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 30,000 shares of our common stock on any such business day (a Regular Purchase ), provided, however, that (i) the Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 40,000 shares, provided that the closing sale price is not below $5.00 on the purchase date, (ii) the Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 50,000 shares, provided that the closing sale price is not below $6.00 on the purchase date, (iii) the Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 60,000 shares, provided that the closing sale price is not below $7.50 on the purchase date, (iv) the Regular Purchase may be increased to up to 70,000 shares, provided that the closing sale price is not below $10.00 on the purchase date, and (v) we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase shares in a Regular Purchase only if at least one business day has passed since the most recent Regular Purchase, as applicable, was completed.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	In each case, the maximum amount of any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $1,000,000 per purchase.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	In addition to Regular Purchases described above, we may also direct Lincoln Park, on any business day on which we have properly submitted a Regular Purchase notice and the closing sale price of our common stock is not below $3.00 (subject to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction as provided in the Purchase Agreement), to purchase an additional amount of our common stock on the next business day (an Accelerated Purchase ), not to exceed the lesser of:
1430306_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Three (3) times the number of purchase shares purchased pursuant to the corresponding Regular Purchase.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	In addition to the Regular Purchases described above, we had the option, on the first day that we were able to begin selling shares to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement, to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 300,000 shares (the Initial Purchase ), provided, however, that Lincoln Park s committed obligation under the Initial Purchase could not exceed $1,000,000.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Lincoln Park made an initial purchase of 218,340 shares.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	In addition to the Regular Purchases, Accelerated Purchases and the Initial Purchase described above, from time to time we may also direct Lincoln Park, on any business day that the closing price of ours common stock is not below $3.00, to purchase additional amounts of its common stock (an Additional Purchase ), provided, however, that (i) we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase shares in an Additional Purchase only if at least 15 business days have passed since the most recent Additional Purchase, as applicable, was completed, (ii) we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase shares in an Additional Purchase only if at least 30 business days have passed since the Initial Purchase, if exercised, was completed, (iii) Lincoln Park s committed obligation under any single Additional Purchase shall not exceed $500,000, and (iv) Lincoln Park s committed obligation under all Additional Purchases shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Through March 1, 2018, we have sold an aggregate of 248,340 shares of common stock, including the initial purchase, under the Purchase Agreement, for gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 million, at an average selling price of $4.56 per share.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	On March 30, 2017, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp., as representative of the several underwriters (collectively, the 2017 Underwriters ), relating to the issuance and sale of 1,800,000 shares of our common stock, in an underwritten public offering (the April 2017 Financing ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The public offering price for each share of common stock was $4.45.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	We granted the 2017 Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 270,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	The April 2017 Financing closed on April 4, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	The 2017 Underwriters purchased the shares at a seven percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of $0.6 million (or $0.31 per share).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	We incurred offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	We received net proceeds of approximately $7.2 million.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P64_S4	On April 13, 2017, the 2017 Underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 270,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million, net of an aggregate discount of $0.1 million (or $0.31 per share).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	On April 28, 2016, we entered into a sales agreement (the 2016 Sales Agreement ) with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen ), as sales agent, pursuant to which we could have, from time to time, issued and sold common stock with an aggregate value of up to $15.0 million in at-the-market ( ATM ) sales.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	On the same day, we filed a prospectus supplement under our existing shelf registration relating to the 2016 Sales Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	Cowen acted as sole sales agent for any sales made under the 2016 Sales Agreement for a 3% commission on gross proceeds.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our common stock was sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, and, as a result, prices varied.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 500,889 shares of common stock using the ATM, resulting in net proceeds of $5.4 million, net of expenses of approximately $0.2 million of Cowen s commission.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold an aggregate of 1,486,474 shares of common stock using the ATM, resulting in net proceeds of $9.1 million, net of expenses of approximately $0.3 million of Cowen s commission.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	With these sales, we sold all $15 million of shares under the 2016 Sales Agreement, and the 2016 Sales Agreement was terminated.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	On August 1, 2017, we entered into a new sales agreement (the 2017 Sales Agreement ) with Cowen, as sales agent, pursuant to which we could, from time to time, issue and sell common stock with an aggregate value of up to $9.0 million in ATM sales.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	No shares of common stock have been sold under the 2017 Sales Agreement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	On September 15, 2017, we withdrew the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 11, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	We will not make sales under the 2017 Sales Agreement until a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 is filed and declared effective.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	On October 26, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Dawson James Securities, Inc. ( Dawson ) relating to the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 950,000 units ( Unit , and collectively, the Units ) at a public offering price of $5.50 per Unit in an underwritten public offering (the October 2016 Financing ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Each Unit consisted of one share of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and a warrant to purchase one-half share of common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Because we are prohibited from issuing fractional shares, the warrants can only be exercised in lots of two, which means that each holder must exercise two warrants to receive one share of common stock, or an aggregate of 475,000 shares of common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	The warrants have an initial exercise price of $6.30 per share and have a term of five years.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the warrants.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	We also granted Dawson a 45-day option to purchase up to 142,500 additional shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to 71,250 shares of common stock, to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The October 2016 Financing closed on October 31, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Dawson purchased the Units at an eight-percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of approximately $0.4 million (or $0.40 per Unit).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	Dawson also received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 47,361 shares of common stock, or approximately five percent of the total number of shares included in the Units.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	We received net proceeds from the October 2016 Financing of approximately $4.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses of approximately $0.6 million.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P70_S4	Additionally, Dawson fully exercised the over-allotment option related to the warrants and purchased additional warrants to acquire 71,250 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $700.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	On June 15, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC and National Securities Corporation (collectively, the Underwriters ), relating to the issuance and sale of 500,000 shares of our common stock, in an underwritten public offering (the June 2016 Financing ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	The public offering price for each share of common stock was $20.00.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	We granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 75,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The June 2016 Financing closed on June 21, 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Underwriters purchased the shares at a seven percent discount to the public offering price, for an aggregate discount of $0.7 million (or $1.40 per share).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	We also paid offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	We received net proceeds of approximately $9.1 million.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P73_S3	On July 12, 2016, the Underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 75,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1.4 million, net of an aggregate discount of $0.1 million (or $1.40 per share).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to additional clinical trials.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	We expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term, as we have taken certain measures to reduce costs in order to preserve cash to fund our activities through at least the end of the ongoing Phase 3 HONOR study in military-related PTSD.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	Our existing cash is sufficient to fund our operating expenses and planned clinical trial through the end of 2018, but we do not have enough resources to meet our operating requirements for the one-year period from the date of filing of this Form 10-K.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	We will need to obtain additional capital in order to fund future research and development activities.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have issued awards under our 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	No future awards are issuable under these Prior Plans.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	On June 16, 2017, our stockholders approved the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan and together with the Prior Plans, the Plans ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	As a result of adoption of the 2017 Plan by the stockholders, no further grants may be made under the Prior Plans.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Under the terms of the 2017 Plan, we may issue (1) stock options (incentive and nonstatutory), (2) restricted stock, (3) SARs, (4) RSUs, (5) other stock-based awards, and (6) cash-based awards.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The 2017 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,280,000 shares of common stock, which amount will be (a) reduced by awards granted under the Prior Plans after March 31, 2017, and (b) increased to the extent that awards granted under the Plans are forfeited, expire or are settled for cash (except as otherwise provided in the 2017 Plan).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	In terms of calculating how many shares are reduced or increased based on activity under the Prior Plans after March 31, 2017, the calculation shall be based on one share for every one share that was subject to an option or SAR and 1.15 shares for every one share that was subject to an award other than an option or SAR.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	With respect to awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the 2017 Plan provides that, subject to adjustment as provided in the plan, no participant may, in any 12-month period (i) be granted options or SARs with respect to more than 750,000 shares of our common stock, (ii) earn more than 500,000 shares of our common stock under restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance awards and/or other stock-based awards, or (iii) earn more than $5,000,000 under an award; provided, however, that each of these limitations shall be multiplied by two (2) with respect to awards granted to a participant during the first calendar year in which the participant commences employment with us or any of our subsidiaries.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Board of Directors determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the grants under the 2017 Plan.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	However, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may not be less than 110% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10% or more shareholder and 100% of fair value for a grantee who is not a 10% shareholder.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	The fair value of the common stock is determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in good faith.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P83_S3	Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the 2017 Plan may not be more than five years and expiration period not more than ten years.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P83_S4	We reserved 1,280,000 shares of our common stock for future issuance under the terms of the 2017 Plan.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P83_S5	As of December 31, 2017, 1,185,702 shares were available for future grants under the 2017 Plan.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We measure the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, based on a Binomial option pricing model using certain assumptions discussed in the following paragraph, and the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	Most stock options granted pursuant to the Plans typically vest 1/3rd 12 months from the date of grant and 1/36th each month thereafter for 24 months and expire ten years from the date of grant.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	In addition, we also issue performance-based options to executive officers, which options vest when the target parameters are met, subject to a one-year minimum service period prior to vesting.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Stock-based compensation expense related to awards is amortized over the applicable vesting period using the straight-line method.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted was $2.92 in 2017 and $46.58 in 2016.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Stock-based compensation expense relating to options granted of $1.7 million and $2.9 million was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $0.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards granted under the Plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.01 years.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	On June 9, 2014, our Stockholder s approved the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holdings Corp. 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2014 ESPP ).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The 2014 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase up to an aggregate of 30,000 shares of our common stock.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S2	Under the 2014 ESPP, on the first day of each offering period, each eligible employee for that offering period has the option to enroll for that offering period, which allows the eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of the offering period.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S3	Each offering period under the 2014 ESPP is for six months, which can be modified from time-to-time.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S4	Subject to limitations, each participant will be permitted to purchase a number of shares determined by dividing the employee s accumulated payroll deductions for the offering period by the applicable purchase price, which is equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is less.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S5	A participant must designate in his or her enrollment package the percentage (if any) of compensation to be deducted during that offering period for the purchase of stock under the 2014 ESPP, subject to the statutory limit under the Code.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P89_S6	As of December 31, 2017, there were 1,689 shares available for future issuance under the 2014 ESPP.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	The 2014 ESPP is considered a compensatory plan with the related compensation cost written off over the six month offering period.

1430306_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P96_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P96_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	We outsource our research and development efforts and expense the related costs as incurred, including the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and clinical research organizations and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	We account for trial expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by participant progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	We determine accrual estimates that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P100_S3	We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P100_S4	Our clinical trial accruals and prepaid assets are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	Restricted stock payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	We record an estimated valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	We recognized a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P102_S3	The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changes the existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, a change in the treatment of operating loss carryforwards as well as other changes.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	As a result of enactment of the legislation, the Company anticipates a one-time change to its deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	As the Company has a full valuation allowance such change is not expected to impact the Company s results of operations or financial position.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	All impacts of the Tax Act have been measured in the Company s income tax provision.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	Lessees (for capital and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S4	The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S5	Lessees may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P105_S6	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	In November 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, to provide guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows, thereby reducing the diversity in presentation.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted this guidance and have reclassified certain balances on the consolidated cash flow statement in accordance with this adoption.
1430306_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Other than contractual obligations incurred in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retain or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.

1430306_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has continuing losses and negative cash flows from operating activities which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P1_S3	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.

1430306_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P3_S3	As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P3_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P4_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2010.

1430306_18_ITEM8_P9_S4	The Company believes that these resources, will be sufficient to meet its projected operating requirements through the end of 2018 but it does not have enough resources to meet its operating requirements for the one-year period from the date of filing of the 10-K. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company continues to face significant challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, the Company s available capital resources may be consumed more rapidly than currently expected due to changes the Company may make in its research and development spending plans.

1430306_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The Company has the ability to obtain additional funding through public or private financing or collaborative arrangements with strategic partners to increase the funds available to fund operations.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	However, the Company may not be able to raise capital with terms acceptable to the company.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P11_S2	Without additional funds, the Company may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of its research and development activities, or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue its operations.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P11_S3	If any of these events occurs, the Company s ability to achieve its development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected.

1430306_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.

1430306_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	The operations and management of Tonix Holding Pharma Limited are located in Bermuda, and accordingly, are not subject to income taxes in Ireland, which is its country of incorporation.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	The operations of Tonix Holding Pharma Limited are not subject to income tax in Bermuda.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	A reconciliation of the effect of applying the federal statutory rate to the net loss and the effective income tax rate used to calculate the Company s income tax provision is as follows:
1430306_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):
1430306_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company has incurred research and development ( R D ) expenses, a portion of which qualifies for tax credits.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company conducted an R D credit study to quantify the amount of credits and has claimed an R D credit on its 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax returns.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P94_S2	A portion of these R D credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations in their use in accordance with Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) section 383.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P94_S3	The R D credit carryforwards at December 31, 2017 have been reduced to zero to reflect IRC section 383 ownership changes through December 31, 2017 and the resulting inability to utilize a portion of the R D credit prior to its expiration.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	At December 31, 2017, the Company had available unused net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards of approximately $0.3 million that expire between 2030 and 2036 for federal tax purposes.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Company also has approximately $0.0 million of NOL carryforwards for New York State and $0.1 million for New York City purposes expiring between 2035 and 2036.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	Additionally, the Company has $4.2 million of Ireland NOL carryforwards that do not expire and $0.1 million of Quebec NOL which expires between 2035 and 2037.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	A portion of the federal, New York State, and New York City NOL carryforwards are subject to annual limitations in their use in accordance with IRC section 382.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	The NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2017 have been reduced to reflect IRC section 382 ownership changes through December 31, 2017 and the resultant inability due to annual limitations, to utilize a portion of the NOL prior to its expiration.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P97_S3	As such, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly, has provided a full valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P97_S4	The (decrease)/increase in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were ($13.9) million, and $1.8 million respectively.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	However, as of December 31, 2016 there are no unrecognized tax benefits recorded.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P98_S3	As of December 31, 2017, the Company s tax returns remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities for the tax years 2014 and after.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
1430306_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense; creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax ( BEAT ), a new minimum tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The change to a modified territorial tax system resulted in a one-time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the Transition Tax ), with future distributions not subject to U.S. federal income tax when repatriated.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	A majority of the provisions in the Tax Act are effective January 1, 2018.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company has reflected the impact of the changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The adjustment of the tax rates reduced the gross deferred tax asset by $4.8 million with a corresponding $4.8 million adjustment to the valuation allowance.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P101_S2	This has no impact to the net tax expense.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	In connection with the Company s analysis of the impact of the Transition Tax, the Company determined that the foreign subsidiaries are in a net accumulated deficit so the Company has recorded no tax expense for the period ending December 31, 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	All impacts of the Tax Act have been measured in the Company s income tax provision.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	On February 13, 2018, the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 534,008 shares of the Company s common stock to employees with an exercise price of $3.40, with a term of ten years, vesting 1/3 on the first anniversary and 1/36th each month thereafter for 24 months.
1430306_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	Additionally, the Company granted options to purchase 293,626 shares of the Company s common stock to employees with an exercise price of $4.25, with a term of ten years, vesting 1/3 on the first anniversary and 1/36th each month thereafter for 24 months.

1430306_18_ITEM9_P1_S0	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P1_S1	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P1_S2	In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P2_S0	Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

1430306_18_ITEM9_P6_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P6_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1430306_18_ITEM9_P7_S0	(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P8_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P8_S2	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible enhancements to controls and procedures.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P9_S0	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P9_S1	Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer conclude that, at December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P10_S0	This annual report does not include an attestation report by EisnerAmper LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P10_S1	As a smaller reporting company, our management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

1430306_18_ITEM9_P63_S1	Officers serve at the discretion of the Board.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P64_S0	The Board has determined that (i) Seth Lederman has a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and is not an independent director as defined in the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market and (ii) Margaret Smith Bell, Patrick Grace, David Grange, Donald Landry, Ernest Mario, Charles Mather, John Rhodes and Samuel Saks are each an independent director as defined in the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P64_S1	Prior to his resignation in February 2018, the Board found that Mr. Davidson was also an independent director.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S0	Our CEO also serves as the chairman of the Board.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S1	An independent director serves as the Board s lead director.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S2	This structure allows one person to speak for and lead both the Company and the Board, while also providing for effective independent board oversight through an independent lead director.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S3	Having Dr. Lederman, our CEO, serve as Chairman creates clear and unambiguous authority, which is essential to effective management.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S4	Our Board and management can respond more effectively to a clearer line of authority.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S5	By designating our CEO as its Chairman, our Board also sends as an important signal to our employees and shareholders about who is accountable.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P65_S6	Further, since Dr. Lederman is the founder of our Company and is an inventor on key patents and patent applications underlying our programs, we believe that Dr. Lederman is best-positioned to set our Board s agenda and provide leadership.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P66_S0	We have established the position of lead director, which is filled by Mr. Rhodes.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P66_S1	The lead director has the following responsibilities, as detailed in the Lead Director charter, adopted by the Board (and also performs any other functions the Board may request):
1430306_18_ITEM9_P67_S0	Advisors and consultants recommends to the Board the retention of outside advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board on Board-wide issues.

1430306_18_ITEM9_P78_S2	In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for developing, recommending and evaluating corporate governance standards and a code of business conduct and ethics.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P79_S0	As provided in its charter and our Company s corporate governance principles, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become directors.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P79_S1	The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify director candidates based on input provided by a number of sources, including (1) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members, (2) our other directors, (3) our shareholders, (4) our Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, and (5) third parties such as professional search firms.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P79_S2	In evaluating potential candidates for director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the entirety of each candidate s credentials.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P80_S0	Qualifications for consideration as a director nominee may vary according to the particular areas of expertise being sought as a complement to the existing composition of the Board.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P80_S1	However, at a minimum, candidates for director must possess:
1430306_18_ITEM9_P81_S0	the appropriate and relevant business experience and acumen.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P82_S0	In addition to these minimum qualifications, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also takes into account when considering whether to nominate a potential director candidate the following factors:
1430306_18_ITEM9_P83_S0	the importance of diversified Board membership, in terms of both the individuals involved and their various experiences and areas of expertise.

1430306_18_ITEM9_P86_S0	All candidates submitted by shareholders will be evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee according to the criteria discussed above and in the same manner as all other director candidates.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P87_S0	We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P88_S0	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC reports regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our securities.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P88_S1	We believe that, during fiscal 2017, our directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P89_S0	Due to administrative errors, each of Drs.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P89_S1	Landry, Mario and Saks, and Messrs. Grace, Mathers and Rhodes failed to timely file a Form 4 with respect to two transactions, pertaining to the vesting of restricted stock units, during the most recent fiscal year.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P89_S2	This error was corrected in later filings.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P89_S3	Also due to an administrative error, Dr. Mario failed to timely file Form 4s with respect to 4 additional transactions, a series of sales of common stock, during December 2017.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P89_S4	This error was corrected in a later filing.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P90_S0	Except as disclosed below, our directors and executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years:
1430306_18_ITEM9_P91_S0	being subject of or party to any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization, any registered entity or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P92_S0	In January 2013, the Chief Operating Officer filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of Title 11 under the United States Code in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, New York.
1430306_18_ITEM9_P92_S1	The petition was discharged in April 2013.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P0_S0	We believe that the performance of our executive officers significantly impacts our ability to achieve our corporate goals.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P0_S1	We, therefore, place considerable importance on the design and administration of our executive officer compensation program.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P0_S2	This program is intended to enhance stockholder value by attracting, motivating and retaining qualified individuals to perform at the highest levels and to contribute to our growth and success.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P1_S0	Our executive officer compensation program is designed to provide compensation opportunities that are tied to individual and corporate performance.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P2_S0	Our compensation packages are also designed to be competitive in our industry.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P2_S1	The Compensation Committee from time-to-time consults with compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors in designing our compensation program, including in evaluating the competitiveness of individual compensation packages and in relation to our corporate goals.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P3_S0	Our overall compensation philosophy has been to pay our executive officers an annual base salary and to provide opportunities, through cash and equity incentives, to provide higher compensation if certain key performance goals are satisfied.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P3_S1	We believe that many of our key practices and programs demonstrate good governance.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P3_S2	The main principles of our fiscal year 2017 compensation strategy included the following:
1430306_18_ITEM11_P4_S0	An emphasis on pay for performance .
1430306_18_ITEM11_P5_S0	Performance results are linked to Company and individual performance .
1430306_18_ITEM11_P5_S1	When looking at performance over the year, we equally weigh individual performance as well as that of the Company as a whole.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	Equity as a key component to align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	While the Compensation Committee considers the level of compensation paid by the companies in our peer group as a reference point that provides a framework for its compensation decisions, in order to maintain competitiveness and flexibility, the Compensation Committee does not target compensation at a particular level relative to the peer group; nor does the Compensation Committee employ a formal benchmarking strategy or rely upon specific peer derived targets.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	In 2017, we also continued practices that demonstrate good governance and careful stewardship of corporate assets, including:
1430306_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	Our executive officers are eligible for the same benefits as our non-executive salaried employees, and they do not receive any additional perquisites.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P10_S0	We do not provide our executive officers with a traditional retirement plan, or with any supplemental deferred compensation or retirement benefits.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	We do not provide our executive officers with any tax gross-ups.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	No single-trigger cash change in control benefits .
1430306_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	We do not provide cash benefits to our executives upon a change in control, absent an actual termination of employment.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	At our annual meeting in May 2016, we conducted our tri-annual advisory vote on executive compensation, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P13_S1	At that time, approximately 95% of the votes affirmatively cast on the advisory say-on-pay proposal were voted in favor of the compensation of our named executive officers.
1430306_18_ITEM11_P13_S2	The Compensation Committee understood this level of approval to indicate strong stockholder support for our executive compensation policies and programs generally, and as a result, our Compensation Committee made no fundamental changes to our executive compensation programs.
