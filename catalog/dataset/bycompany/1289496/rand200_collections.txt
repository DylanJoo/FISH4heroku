1289496_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Cord Blood America, Inc. ("CBAI"), formerly D A Lending, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Florida on October 12, 1999.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	In October, 2009, CBAI re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	CBAI is primarily a holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiaries include Cord Partners, Inc., CorCell Co. Inc., CorCell Ltd., ( Cord ), CBA Professional Services, Inc.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	D/B/A BodyCells, Inc. ("BodyCells"), CBA Properties, Inc. ("Properties"), and Career Channel Inc D/B/A Rainmakers International ("Rain").
1289496_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	In March 2010, CBAI purchased a majority interest in Stellacure GmbH ( Stellacure ).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	In September 2010, CBAI purchased a majority interest in Biocordcell Argentina S.A. ( Bio ).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	CBAI and its subsidiaries engage in the following business activities:
1289496_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Cord specializes in providing private cord blood stem cell preservation services to families.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	Stellacure GmbH specializes in providing cord blood stem cell preservation services to families in Germany, Spain and Italy.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Biocordcell Argentina S.A. specializes in providing cord blood stem cell preservation to families in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	BodyCells is a developmental stage company and intends to be in the business of collecting, processing and preserving peripheral blood and adipose tissue stem cells allowing individuals to privately preserve their stem cells for potential future use in stem cell therapy.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Properties was formed to hold the corporate trademarks and other intellectual property.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Rain has specialized in creating direct response television and radio advertising campaigns, including media placement and commercial production.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Management has reduced the activities of Rain, terminated its former employees, and by the end of 2010, was no longer seeking additional business.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	This is consistent with management s decision to focus its attention exclusively on the stem cell storage business and related activities.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	On January 22, 2010, we officially opened our new stem cell storage facility.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	On March 1, 2010, we commenced processing cord blood at this new facility and on March 8, 2010, our cryogenic freezers arrived, which allows us to store cord blood specimens in our own facility.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	We intend to continue our organic growth through continued improvement of internal processes, continued improvement and expansion of our relationships with health insurance providers, and by leveraging those relationships in the pregnancy programs with those providers.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	We will expend more limited effort on expanded print, direct response and internet marketing efforts to facilitate increased prospective customer contact.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S4	Additionally, we will be concentrating our efforts on building additional sales channels through obstetrics and gynecological practices and other healthcare professionals, hospitals and other health care influencers.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S5	We also hope to leverage our growth through continued mergers and/or acquisitions of other stem cell preservation companies.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S6	We are currently exploring various acquisition opportunities and will continue to do so.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P9_S7	We intend to continue to fund mergers and acquisitions to the extent that we identify opportunities and are able to obtain capital on commercially reasonable terms for this purpose from placements of equity, debt or convertible debt.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	In an effort to raise more capital, on July 2, 2009, the Company executed a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and Warrant Agreement with Optimus Capital Partners, LLC, which contemplates a $7.5 million capital commitment which may be drawn down in increments in the future by the Company under certain conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement registering common shares issuable upon Warrant exercise and certain common shares issued as a fee at the outset.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	On November 2, 2009, the Company filed its registration statement for these common shares as required by these agreements.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	However, the Company is reassessing whether to follow through with the implementation of this capital commitment.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	In the mean time, on January 27, 2010, the Company elected to withdraw its registration statement filed with the SEC.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	At the end of March 2010, the Company acquired 138,712 Series B Shares (the Shares) in Stellacure GmbH, a German Limited Liability Company which is in the business of collecting, processing and storing cord blood samples as a private bank for use in current or future medical therapies in Germany, Spain, and other European and Middle Eastern Countries.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our shares represent 51% of the total outstanding shares of Stellacure.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Cord believes this acquisition may serve as a strategic footprint into the growth of the stem cell business throughout Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition to Germany, where Stellacure started processing and storing in 2006, additional Stellacure sales channels established in 2009 in Spain and Italy provide immediate market penetration and an opportunity for growth.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Cord Blood views the established relationship Stellacure has with the German Red Cross as a potential catalyst for expansion of Cord Blood services throughout Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	In March, of 2010 the Company acquired pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non dilutable interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In exchange for issuance of an equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalty's payable beginning in 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	In December the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	As of March, 2011, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, provided a total of $500,000 in additional capital to Cayman, and received Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 100 Cayman Warrants.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Secured Convertible Promissory Notes are convertible into Cayman stock at a conversion price of $1,500 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	The Warrants have a five year term and are exercisable at an option exercise price of $0.05 per share per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	As of March, 2011, other shareholders of Cayman have exercised options with similar terms, provided $500,000 in additional capital to Cayman, and are entitled to similar Cayman Secured Convertible Notes and to be issued an aggregate of 100 Cayman Warrants.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 11,111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 64,488,889 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	The plan is scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	However, Vivi has subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P20_S5	The Company has advised Vivi that unless the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi capital stock can be delivered to the Company as required under the Plan, the Company will declare a default under the Plan and pursue its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all Vivi assets and all assets of the Subsidiaries.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	At the end of September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.1% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares), and concurrently closed the stock purchase transaction on the same date.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Cord believes this acquisition will serve as an important piece to the continual growth of the Company.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Bio is headquartered in Argentina, with affiliates under development in Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Panama and Puerto Rico, and recent expansion into Uruguay and Paraguay.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	With these acquisitions and investments, we now own a state-of-the-art laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada, a stem cell company in Germany, and a stem cell company in Argentina, and a percentage ownership in what could be the world's largest stem cell storage facility in China.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	As a publicly traded small cap company, Cord Blood is reliant on a private entity, the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ), to permit its publicly traded shares to be eligible for electronic stock transactions.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	The DTC is the only entity of its kind and is essentially unregulated.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	In December, 2010, the DTC unilaterally and without consultation with the Company, chilled all newly issued shares of the Company which were entitled to be freely traded in the market and whose holders expected to utilize the DTC Electronic Trading System.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Under what the DTC calls a chill , DTC precludes shares which it has unilaterally chilled from utilizing its Electronic Stock Transfer System, thereby putting the holders of such chilled shares at extreme disadvantage in the trading market when they go to sell their shares.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	The chill applies to all shares newly issued or newly freed from private placement sales restrictions.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	The chill includes as to the Company, even shares for which an effective registration statement is in place, and shares for which valid legal opinions have been issued by seasoned securities law counsel opining as to share entitlement to free trading status under SEC Rule 144.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	The Chill fortunately does not apply to existing publicly traded shares of the Company which are out in the market place.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S5	However, the holders of these chilled shares of the Company are the key investment bankers whose funds have been supporting CBAI with capital lines to fund its expanding business.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S6	The Company has been forced to negotiate settlement agreements with its existing investment bankers to settle alleged breachs of contract as a result of this DTC chill and the unavailability of DTC electronic transfer for chilled Company shares.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S7	Such settlement agreements have already cost the Company approximately $820,000 in damages.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S8	The Company is endeavoring to maintain a dialogue with DTC over what the Company considers to be an unreasonable and illegal chill of its securities without cause or justification, in an effort to have this chill lifted.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S9	Whether the Company will be successful in obtaining relief from this chill is at this point uncertain.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P25_S10	Continued implementation of the DTC chill will make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new capital which its needs to expand its business, and will likely increase claims for contract damages which the Company may have to pay as a result of its inability to deliver shares to investment bankers which are eligible for DTC electronic transfer.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and very useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove approximately one liter of bone marrow.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P36_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	According to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, over 45,000 bone marrow and other hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant procedures were performed worldwide in 2002.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	In the past decade, several public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and preservation of these cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	This blood is preserved and made available for a significant fee to anyone who needs it in the future.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	We do not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Private, or family, cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	This blood is preserved and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Stem cells have been successfully recovered from cord blood after at least fifteen years of storage in liquid nitrogen.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	However, these cells may be able to retain their usefulness at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Cord s customers are typically expectant parents who choose to collect and store umbilical cord blood at the birth of their child for potential use in a stem cell transplant at a later date for that child or for another family member.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	With the opening of the lab in Las Vegas, NV, Cord is able to provide services to collect, test, process and preserve umbilical cord blood.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Private cord blood banking has been growing in acceptance by the medical community and has become increasingly popular with families.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	For an initial fee of approximately $2,075 and an annual storage fee of approximately $125 for each year thereafter, Cord provides the following services to each customer:
1289496_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	We provide a kit that contains all of the materials necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for later testing.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	We provide 24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood maternal blood samples.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	We manage all logistics for transporting the cord blood unit to our centralized facility immediately following birth.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	This procedure ensures chain-of-custody control during transportation for maximum security.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	At the laboratory, the cord blood sample is tested for stem cell concentration levels and blood type.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	The cord blood sample and the maternal blood sample are also tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	We report these results to both the mother and her doctor.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least eighteen years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	PharmaStem Therapeutics holds certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	In the past five years, PharmaStem has commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of our competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P52_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners may, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem technology and processes covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P52_S4	All of the patents are scheduled to expire in 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Other than royalties, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	As of 2008, Cord has ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P53_S4	The patents have been declared void.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P53_S5	The decision is currently under a final appeal.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	On October 13, 2006, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vita34 for the assets of CorCell, Inc., to begin the process of acquiring the business of collection, processing and storage of blood taken from umbilical cord after a child is born.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	On February 28, 2007, we completed the acquisition.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	The acquisition related to all rights to possession and custody of all acquired samples owned by CorCell, Inc. and associated with the operations of CorCell, Inc., which is predominantly the current customer base and revenues.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	The deal also included the purchase of cryogenic freezers and other fixed assets used in this umbilical cord blood samples business.

1289496_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Management believes that in the US the organic differentiator for the company is its emphasis on strategic relationships with larger health insurance providers.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	This approach differs from our major competitors who tend to focus on a traditional pharmaceutical model by having sales reps cover a market by visiting ob/gyn practices.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	By focusing on the health insurance relationships, while the sales cycle is longer, once established, management believes the sales approach builds loyalty and reoccurring sales.

1289496_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	The 2011 Note bears interest in the form of a onetime interest charge of 10%, payable with the Note s principal amount on the maturity date, January 12, 2014.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	All or a portion of the 2011 Note principal and interest is convertible at the option of JMJ from time to time, into shares of the Company s common stock, originally fixed at a per share conversion price equal to 85% of the average of the 5 lowest traded prices for the Company s common stock in the 20 trading days previous to the effective date of each such conversion.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P82_S3	At the same time, JMJ issued and delivered to the Company, a Secured Collateralized Promissory Note dated January 12, 2011, (the JMJ Note ), which served as sole consideration to the Company for the Company s issuance of the 2011 Note to JMJ.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P82_S4	The JMJ Note is in the principal amount of $1,000,000, bears interest in the form of a onetime interest charge of 10.5%, and interest is payable with the JMJ Note s principal on its maturity date, January 12, 2014..
1289496_11_ITEM1_P82_S5	The JMJ Note is secured by JMJ assets in the form of money market fund or similar equivalent having a value of at least $1,000,000.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Under a previous outstanding Convertible Promissory Note having similar terms as described above and issued to JMJ and funded by JMJ in the amount of approximately $1,750,000 (the Earlier Notes ), the Company was obligated to deliver common shares which could be placed into the Automated System for Deposits and Withdrawals of Securities (known as DWAC ).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	At present the DWAC system is not available to Company shareholders for newly issued shares of the Company s common stock.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	As a result of this breach, on February 8, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with JMJ which contained the following term, among others, which the Company agreed to pay $671,385 in liquidated damages to JMJ, and in consideration for an additional $1 million in financing, said to be added to the principal amount of the Earlier Note.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of 150,000 Euro for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity and 6% from a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	The initial investment is secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that are incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P84_S3	The second tranche provides the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P84_S4	Converting the investment from a loan into equity for tranche two will take place every 12 months, and the obligation will have been met in full after 1,000 samples have been processed and stored.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	The third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	VidaPlus contracts through Stellacure and their relationship with the German Red Cross for their processing and storage.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	The second and third tranches contain conditional components for funding to continue from CBAI, including payments to Stellacure by Vida to be current with previously agreed to terms between the parties.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	The Company believes that further support of a key channel partner to Stellacure provides additional opportunities for expansion throughout Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	On February 24, 2011, the Company acquired the following assets; 593 umbilical cord blood samples and all related file documents, four (4) cryogenic storage tanks, and two computers from Reproductive Genetics Institute, Inc. (RGI) for $76,000 in cash.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	In March 2011, the assets acquired were relocated to the Company s Las Vegas laboratory.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	In 2010 and continuing in 2011, the Company has also entered into three separate letters of intent, two nonbinding and one binding, contemplating the acquisition of two separate operating companies in the stem cell industry.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Acquisition is contingent on completion of ongoing due diligence review to the Company s satisfaction, and the Company s successfully obtaining new capital on commercially reasonable terms to fund one or more, or all of these acquisitions.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	One of these acquisitions is Cryo-Cell de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ( Cryo Mexico ) - see discussion under litigation below).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P88_S3	Another is a US Stem Cell Company, and a third is a South American Stem Cell Company.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	At this stage the only documents that have been executed are Letters of Intent, and each specifically states that it is non-binding.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	Further, Cord Blood has initiated, but has not completed its due diligence.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	Also, each acquisition would require Cord first to locate and obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms in order to consummate the acquisition.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P89_S3	No such arrangements are currently in place, it is uncertain whether such additional capital can be obtained.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P89_S4	Finally, as a condition precedent to obtaining any such additional capital, the Company s shareholders would first have to approve a proposed reverse stock split and proportional increase in authorized capital at a Special Shareholders meeting called for that purpose for April 21, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P89_S5	As a result, although management is optimistic, there can be no assurance that any of the contemplated acquisitions will occur, and at this date there is no obligation on the Company s part to proceed with any of these acquisitions.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	On March 10, 2011, Cord Blood America, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with St. George Investments, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (the "Investor") whereby the Company issued and sold, and the Investor purchased: (i) Secured Convertible Promissory Notes of the Company in the principal amount of $1,105,500 (the "Company Note") and (ii) a Warrant to purchase common stock of the Company (the "Warrant").
1289496_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Investor paid $250,000 in cash as an initial payment to the Company and executed and delivered six separate Secured Buyer Notes (the Buyer Notes ), as consideration in full for the issuance and sale of the Company Note and Warrants.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	The principal amount of the Company Note is $1,105,500 ("Maturity Amount") and the Company Note is due 48 months from the issuance date of March 10, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	The Company Note has an interest rate of 6.0%, which would increase to a rate of 12.0% on the happening of certain Trigger Events, including but not limited to: a decline in the 10-day trailing average daily dollar volume of the common shares in the Company s primary market to less than $30,000.00 of volume per day at any time; the failure by the Company or its transfer agent to deliver Conversion Shares (defined in the Company Note) within 5 days of Company s receipt of a Conversion Notice (defined in the Company Note).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	The total amount funded (in cash and notes) at closing will be $1,000,000, representing the Maturity Amount less an original issue discount of $100,500.00 and the payment of $5,000 to the Investor to cover its fees, with payment consisting of $250,000 advanced at closing and $750,000 in a series of six secured convertible Buyer Notes of $125,000.00 each, with interest rates of 5.0%.
1289496_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	The Buyer Notes are secured by an Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit ( Letter of Credit ).
1289496_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Investor has also received a five year warrant entitling it to purchase 139,925,374 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $.00179.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $42.8 million as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In addition, we have a working capital deficit of approximately $3.8 million as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We had net losses of $8.5 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S4	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P0_S6	If we are unable to generate substantial revenues and/or unable to obtain additional financing to meet our working capital requirements, we may have to curtail our business or cease operations.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Currently, we are dependent upon external financing to fund our operations.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	It is imperative that we receive this external financing to implement our business plan and to finance ongoing operations.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	New capital may not be available, adequate funds may not be sufficient for our operations, or capital may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to our management.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	The recent unilateral action by the DTC in chilling the use of the DTC electronic stock transfer system for privately issued and even registered shares of the Company s common stock issued to its investment bankers,, is likely to make it more difficult and more costly to obtain new sources of capital.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our failure to obtain adequate additional financing would require us to delay, curtail or scale back some or all of our operations would hinder our ability to implement our business plans and could jeopardize our ability to continue our business.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We believe that the key to our success is to increase sales of our cord blood preservation services as well as our advertising services and thereby increase our revenues and available cash.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our success with regard to cord blood preservation services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-preservation of cord blood and our efforts to educate potential customers and sell our services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Broad use and acceptance of our service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We may not have the resources required to promote our services and their potential benefits.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Continued commercialization of our services will also require that we satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of our services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for our services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If we are unable to increase market acceptance of our services, we may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to achieve and then maintain profitability or to continue our operation.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We may be liable to our customers and may lose customers if we provide poor service, if our services do not comply with our agreements or if our storage facilities fail.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We must meet our customers service level expectations and our contractual obligations with respect to our services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Failure to do so could subject us to liability, as well as cause us to lose customers.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In some cases, we rely upon third party contractors to assist us in providing our services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our ability to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of our third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Any material disruption in our ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate us for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If We Do Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, We May Not Be Able To Market Our Cord Blood Banking Services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The cord blood banking services that we provide are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The cord blood facility we use has registered with the FDA as a cord blood banking service, listed its products with the FDA, and will be subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, the FDA has proposed new good tissue practice regulations that would establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as proposed rules for donor suitability.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Consistent with industry practice, our cord blood collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The FDA has announced that it will implement more regulatory procedures for cord blood banking in 2006.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This new regulation may require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval for the collection kits.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Securing any necessary medical device clearance or approval for the cord blood collection kits may involve the submission of a substantial volume of data and may require a lengthy substantive review.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	This would increase costs and could reduce profitability.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The FDA could also require that we cease using the collection kit and require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval prior to further use of the kits.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	This could cause us to cease operations for some period of time.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Of the states in which we provide cord blood banking services, only California, New Jersey and New York currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We maintain the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York and New Jersey.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood banking services, either the cord blood storage facility, or we may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Because Our Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, Our Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Our Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services we provide.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for our services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We believe that our future success will depend largely on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of our customers.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Expectant parents may not use our services and our services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	And, In The Event We Are Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Our Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Cord blood banking and stem cell preservation is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our business faces competition from other operators of cord blood and stem cell preservation businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter our markets and compete with us.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than we do.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	We do not have any research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such R D. Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than us, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than we currently attract.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In the event that we are not able to compete successfully, our business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for us to grow our revenue and maintain our existing business.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm Us.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If our information systems fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Company s sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as the current recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on our services.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Recent volatility in the financial market may negatively impact the Company s ability to access the credit markets.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors while the Company currently requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Our Operations.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew L. Schissler, and our Chief Operating Officer, Joseph Vicente.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The loss of either s services could materially harm our business because of the cost and time necessary to find their successor.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We do not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on either Executive Officer.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We also have other key employees who manage our operations and if we were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	To the extent that we are smaller than our competitors and have fewer resources, we may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Trading of our stock may be restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	In October, 2009, we re-located our headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our new principal office and facilities are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	These facilities encompass approximately 17,000 square feet.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	The property is leased from an unaffiliated third party for a period of 5 years ending September 2014.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	The monthly lease payments are approximately $12,000.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S5	We continue to be responsible for our previous principal office located in Santa Monica, CA until September, 2012, where we leased approximately 2, 200 square feet at a monthly lease cost of approximately $9,500.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S6	As of October 2010, we have been able to sublease the Santa Monica, CA property.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P0_S7	The property has been sub-leased for $6,297 per month, commencing January 2011 and is to continue for the remainder of the lease.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We maintain fire and casualty insurance on our leased property in an amount deemed adequate by management.
1289496_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The German and Argentina subsidiaries both lease facilities for operations in Hamburg, Germany and Buenos Aires, Argentina respectively.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	On December 16, 2010, Cryo-Cell International, Inc. ( Cryo International ) filed an action against Cord Blood America, Inc. (the Company ) in The Sixth Judicial Circuit Court, Pinellas County, Florida alleging claims for: tortuous interference with a business relationship; misappropriate of trade secrets and confidential information in violation of the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 688.001, Et.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	Stat.; dilution of trademark in violation of 495.151, Fla.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	Stat.; and Common Law Unfair Competition.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	Cryo International, a competitor of the Company s, has filed the suit apparently in an effort to stop the Company s pursuit of the acquisition of Cryo-Cell de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ( Cryo Mexico ), for which the Company has in place a non binding Letter of Intent for acquisition.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	In addition, along with its Complaint, Cryo International filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Injunction.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	In January 2011, the Company filed a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Cryo International s Emergency Motion for Temporary Injunction, and a Rule 1.140(b) Motion to Dismiss Cryo International s complaint, as well as amendments to these documents.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S6	The Emergency Motion for a Temporary Injunction, Motion to Dismiss and related filings were heard by the Court on January 14, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P0_S7	The Court granted the Company s Motion to Dismiss, finding that Cryo Mexico is an indispensible party to the lawsuit and granted Cryo International leave to file an amended complaint to add Cryo Mexico as a defendant to the lawsuit and to serve Cryo Mexico with the required legal papers.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Cryo International filed an Amended Complaint on January 20, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Amended Complaint added Cryo Mexico as a defendant to the action, asserted all of the original causes of action against the Company, and added a claim for Breach of a License Agreement against Cryo Mexico and a claim for Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices in violation of 501.201, Et.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	Stat. against Cryo Mexico and the Company.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	Cryo International also filed an amended motion for temporary injunction.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	Regarding Amended Complaint, seeking dismissal of the Amended Complaint.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Defendants Motions to Dismiss and Defendant Cryo Mexico s Motion to Quash were heard on March 14, 2011.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	The Court has not yet rendered a decision as to these motions.
1289496_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	Company management believes that there is no merit to the claims filed by Cryo International and the Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims.

1289496_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with the common shares of stock.
1289496_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have never declared or paid a cash dividend.
1289496_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	There are legal restrictions which preclude our ability to pay cash dividends on our common shares so long as we have an accumulated deficit.
1289496_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	We do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1289496_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	(d) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans.
1289496_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table sets forth the information indicated with respect to our compensation plans as of December 31, 2010, under which our common stock is authorized for issuance.

1289496_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	We did not repurchase any of our shares during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	CBAI is primarily an umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation company with a particular focus on the acquisition of customers in need of family based products and services.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation operations provide umbilical cord blood banking services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our corporate headquarters recently re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cord blood testing, processing, and some storage was conducted by our outsourced laboratory partner, Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC, (PCT) in New Jersey.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	In March 2010, we began to process and store cord blood in our own facility, terminating our contract with PCT on February 28, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We provide the following services to each customer.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	We provide a medical kit that contains all of the materials necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for later testing.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	We provide 24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood maternal blood samples.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We coordinate the transportation of the cord blood unit to our laboratory in Las Vegas, immediately following birth.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	This process utilizes a private medical courier, Airnet, for maximum efficiency and security.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	At the laboratory, the cord blood sample is tested for stem cell concentration levels, bacteria and blood type.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The maternal blood sample is tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	We report these results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least fifteen years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, both through organic growth and acquisition.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Based in Hamburg Germany, Stellacure GmbH collects, processes and stores cord blood samples as a private bank for use in current or future medical therapies in Germany, Spain, and other European and Middle Eastern Countries.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Based in Buenos Aires, Biocordcell Argentina S.A., processes and stores cord blood samples as a private bank for use in current or future medical therapies in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Rain had specialized in creating direct response television and radio advertising campaigns, including media placement and commercial production.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Management has reduced the activities of Rain, terminated its former employees, and is no longer seeking business.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	This is consistent with management s decision to focus its attention on the stem cell storage business and related activities.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We are continuing to pursue other growth opportunities by acquisition or internal growth.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The development of BodyCells, which is anticipated to facilitate the collecting, processing and preserving of peripheral blood and adipose tissue stem cells allowing individuals to privately preserve their stem cells for potential future use in stem cell therapy, is currently suspended pending the identification of an alternative lab to partner with.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require estimates and assumptions based on our judgment of changing market conditions and the performance of our assets and liabilities at any given time.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	In determining which accounting policies meet this definition, we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	We believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following:
1289496_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood, placenta collection and whole cord blood collection, advertising, commercial production and internet lead generation.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Accounts receivable relating to deferred revenues are netted against deferred revenue for presentation purposes.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	The allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Cord provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force (Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, ).
1289496_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees are recognized upon the completion of processing.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Rain generated revenue from packaged advertising services, including media buying, marketing and advertising production services.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Rain s advertising service revenue was recognized when the media ad space was sold and the advertising occurred.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Rain s advertising production service revenue was derived through the production of an advertising campaign including, but not limited to audio and video production, establishment of a target market and the development of an advertising campaign.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about the ability to collect.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and/or the creditworthiness of our clients customers, which is based on current published credit ratings, current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customer and other factors that we believe are relevant.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	If we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation operations provide umbilical cord blood banking services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States, Argentina, and Germany.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Our corporate headquarters are located in Las Vegas, NV.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	We provide a medical kit that contains all of the materials necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for later testing.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	We provide 24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood maternal blood samples.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We coordinate the transportation of the cord blood unit to our laboratory partner, immediately following birth.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	This process utilizes a private medical courier, Airnet, for maximum efficiency and security.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	At the laboratory, the cord blood sample is tested for stem cell concentration levels, bacteria and blood type.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The maternal blood sample is tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	We report these results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least fifteen years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess the market conditions, particularly related to the cost of customer acquisition, and whether organic growth or continued M A activity will lead CBAI closer to profitability.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We believe that the Stellacure acquisition may serve as a strategic footprint into the growth of the stem cell business throughout Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In addition to Germany, where Stellacure started processing and storing in 2006, additional Stellacure sales channels established in 2009 in Spain and Italy provide immediate market penetration and an opportunity for growth.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Cord Blood management intends to continue to pursue additional sales channels in other markets in 2011, to the extent capital is available for this purpose.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Cord Blood views the established relationship Stellacure has with the German Red Cross as a potential catalyst for expansion of Cord Blood services throughout Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We believe the Biocordcell acquisition serves as an important piece to the continual growth of the Company.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Bio is headquartered in Argentina, with affiliates under development in Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Panama and Puerto Rico, and recent expansion into Uruguay and Paraguay.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	With these recent acquisitions, we now own a state-of-the-art laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada, a stem cell company in Germany, a stem cell company in Argentina, and we are partners in what could be the world's largest stem cell storage facility in China.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	We are continuing to pursue other growth opportunities by acquisition or internal growth.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The development of BodyCells, which is anticipated to facilitate the collecting, processing and preserving of peripheral blood and adipose tissue stem cells allowing individuals to privately preserve their stem cells for potential future use in stem cell therapy, is currently suspended pending the identification of an alternative lab to partner with.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, our total revenue increased $0.9 million, or 28% to $4.1 million as compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	Cord s revenues were $3.25 million, while Stellacure s revenues contributed $0.45 million, and Biocordcell s revenues contributed $0.43 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in revenue overall, is due to growth in our customer list, revenue generation from the placenta project, which contributed $0.1 million, and the acquisitions of Stellacure and Biocordcell.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	Cord s annual storage fees increased approximately $0.5 million, or 30% from the prior comparative year, to approximately $2.2 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	Cord remains focused on strategic organic growth and accretive acquisition strategies, which management hopes will reduce or eliminate the losses and negative operating cash flow.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cost of services increased $0.2 million to $1.6 million, and gross profit which is 61% increased $0.8 million, or 41% to $2.5 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The increase is a result of the duplicate costs incurred while bringing the lab process in house and continuing to pay for outsourcing early on during the year, which was an added cost of $0.2 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	In addition to these duplicate costs, we incurred $0.1 million in costs associated with implementing the placenta project.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	The company anticipates that through the growth and expansion of our Cord business, and the processing and storage of the cord blood in our own facilities, our direct costs should decrease and our gross margins increase.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Administrative and selling expenses increased $1.0 million to a total of $8.3 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Of the $1.0 million increase, $1.2 million was related to the consolidation of which Stellacure was $0.9 million, and Biocordcell was $0.3 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Our interest expense and change in derivatives liability significantly decreased by approximately $2.47 million or 58% to approximately $1.78 million in 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	The primary reason for this decrease is due to the settlement of the Shelter Island Put Option.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	Once settled, the amount was reclassified from a derivative liability to a note payable .
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S5	During the year, the Company spent $0.65 million to purchase Stellacure, a company in Germany.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S6	The acquisition of StellaCure has resulted in start-up costs of $0.8 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S7	In addition to this acquisition, the Company spent $0.3 million as part of the purchase of Biocordcell, a company in Argentina.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P42_S8	These two acquisitions have created opportunities that allow Cord to expand into the European market, and the South American market.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our total net loss decreased approximately $1.3 million, or 13% from $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Of the $8.5 million net loss in 2010, $4.5 million was related to non-cash expenses made up of $1.7 million in interest and changes in derivative liabilities, $0.6 million in depreciation and amortization, and $2.2 million in stock compensation.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	We have experienced net losses of $8.5 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had $0.35 million in cash.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	We currently collect cash receipts from operations through Cord and both of our subsidiaries, Biocordcells and Stellacure.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	Cash flows from operations are not currently sufficient to fund operations in combination with these corporate expenses.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	During the period we eliminated $3.7 million of notes payable, through equity issuances.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net cash used in operating activities increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior comparative year to $4.4 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase was a result of the $0.3 million towards the acquisition of Bio, $0.6 million in operating assets and liabilities, and $0.4 million in non-controlling interest.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately $1.5 million from the prior comparative year to $4.5 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	This increase was due to the issuance of notes payable amounting to $4.2 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	During the year, cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $0.4 million from the prior comparative year to $0.3 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Since inception, we have financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and repayments on loans.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	As we expand our operational activities, we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations and we will be required to obtain additional financing to fund operations through equity offerings and borrowings to the extent necessary to provide working capital.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Financing may not be available, and, if available, it may not be available on acceptable terms.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	Should we secure such financing, it could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	The sale of debt would, among other things, adversely impact our balance sheet, increase our expenses and increase our cash flow requirements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S5	The sale of equity could, among other things, result in dilution to our shareholders.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S6	If our cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then we would either need to cut back on our budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P46_S7	If we are unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products, we could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our total assets were $7.4 million as compared to $5.2 million as of December 31, 2009, or an increase of approximately 42%.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	A portion of this increase, or $0.8 million, is due to the acquisition of Stellacure and Biocordcell.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Additionally these aquisitions, provided for an additional $0.3 million of accounts receivable, $0.1 million of property and equipment, and $0.3 million of goodwill.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	As of December 31, 2010, total liabilities increased approximately 28% to $6.6 million as compared to approximately $5.2 million as of December 31, 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Stellacure and Biocordcell, which added $1.7 million, compounded by a decrease in Cord s total liabilities of approximately $0.2 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	Cord s accounts payable have decreased by approximately $0.3 million, or 38% to $0.4 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	Our derivative liability has decreased approximately $2.2 million to $0.2 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P48_S4	During the year, our notes payable have increased approximately $2.0 million to $2.2 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $4.6 million.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	We will continue to carry a deficit until such time, if ever, that we can increase our assets and reduce our significant liabilities which are currently composed of notes payable, derivatives liability, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenues.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC 860, (formerly SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, and an amendment to SFAS No. 140 ).
1289496_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	ASC 860 eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	ASC 860 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The adoption of ASC 860 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC 810 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)).
1289496_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The amendments include: (1) the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, (2) a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and (3) changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest entity.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	ASC 810 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009 and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The adoption of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-15, which changes the fair value accounting for liabilities.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	These changes clarify existing guidance that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, an entity is required to measure fair value using either a valuation technique that uses a quoted price of either a similar liability or a quoted price of an identical or similar liability when traded as an asset, or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurements, such as an income approach (e.g., present value technique).
1289496_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	This guidance also states that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability and a quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 input fair value measurements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	This ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	In January, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The standard amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures to require additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurement.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The standard does not change how fair values are measured.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	This new guidance amends the existing criteria for separating consideration received in multiple-deliverable arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable which is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence, or management estimates.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	Expanded disclosures related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are also required.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively.
1289496_11_ITEM7_P60_S6	The Company does not anticipate there will be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this guidance.
1289496_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedule and notes thereto as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and for each of the two years then ended, together with the independent registered public accounting firm s reports thereon, are set forth on pages F-1 to F-23of this Annual Report.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	It is management's responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer, our chief operations officer, and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The deficiency in our disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	We continue to actively search for additional capital in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will note be prevented or detected.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P9_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The deficiency in our internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	We continue to actively search for additional capital in order to be in position to add the necessary staff to address this material weakness.
1289496_11_ITEM9A_P10_S2	We are also assessing how we can improve our internal control over financial reporting with the current number of employees in an effort to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_11_ITEM10_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the names and positions of our executive officers and directors.

1289496_11_ITEM10_P11_S0	Our board has an Audit Committee made up solely of Timothy McGrath.
1289496_11_ITEM10_P12_S0	Our Board of Directors has determined that Cord Blood has one Audit Committee financial expert, Mr. McGrath, On April 6, 2006; the board adopted its written Audit Committee charter.
1289496_11_ITEM10_P13_S0	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that our officers and directors, and persons who own more that ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with any exchange on which the Company's securities are traded.
1289496_11_ITEM10_P13_S1	Officers, directors and persons owning more than ten percent of such securities are required by Commission regulation to file with the Commission and furnish the Company with copies of all reports required under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

1289496_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following is a discussion of our program for compensating our named executive officers and directors.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	Currently, we do not have a compensation committee, and as such, our Board of Directors is responsible for determining the compensation of our named executive officers.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	The primary goals of our policy of executive compensation are to attract and retain the most talented and dedicated executives possible, to assure that our executives are compensated effectively in a manner consistent with our strategy and competitive practice and to align executives compensation with the achievement of our short- and long-term business objectives.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	The board of directors considers a variety of factors in determining compensation of executives, including their particular background and circumstances, such as their training and prior relevant work experience, their success in attracting and retaining savvy and technically proficient managers and employees, increasing our revenues, broadening our product line offerings, managing our costs and otherwise helping to lead our Company through a period of rapid growth.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P4_S0	In the near future, we expect that our board of directors will form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs of our Company and with the full authority to determine and approve the compensation of our chief executive officer and make recommendations with respect to the compensation of our other executive officers.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P4_S1	We expect that our compensation committee will continue to follow the general approach to executive compensation that we have followed to date, rewarding superior individual and company performance with commensurate cash compensation.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	Our compensation program for the named executive officers consists primarily of base salary.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P5_S1	There is no retirement plan, long-term incentive plan or other such plans, although Mr. Schissler s agreement has a bonus plan, subject to the Board s discretion.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	The base salary we provide is intended to equitably compensate the named executive officers based upon their level of responsibility, complexity and importance of role, leadership and growth potential, and experience.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	Our named executive officers receive base salaries commensurate with their roles and responsibilities.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P7_S1	Base salaries and subsequent adjustments, if any, are reviewed and approved by our board of directors annually, based on an informal review of relevant market data and each executive s performance for the prior year, as well as each executive s experience, expertise and position.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P7_S2	The base salaries paid to our named executive officers in 2010 are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	We provide equity awards as a component of compensation.

1289496_11_ITEM11_P8_S2	We believe that such awards encourage employees to remain employed by the Company and also to attract persons of exceptional ability to become employees of the Company.

1289496_11_ITEM11_P13_S1	Eligible employees may elect to defer a percentage of their eligible compensation in the 401(k) Plan, subject to the statutorily prescribed annual limit.

1289496_11_ITEM11_P14_S2	We intend the 401(k) Plan, and the accompanying trust, to qualify under Sections 401(k) and 501 of the Internal Revenue Code so that contributions by employees to the 401(k) Plan, and income earned (if any) on plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) Plan, and so that we will be able to deduct our contributions, if any, when made.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	The trustee under the 401(k) Plan, at the direction of each participant, may invest the assets of the 401(k) Plan in any of a number of investment options.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P16_S0	Historically, we have not provided our named executive officers with any perquisites and other personal benefits.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P16_S1	We do not view perquisites as a significant element of our compensation structure, but do believe that perquisites can be useful in attracting, motivating and retaining the executive talent for which we compete.
1289496_11_ITEM11_P16_S2	It is expected that our historical practices regarding perquisites will continue and will be subject to periodic review by our by our board of directors.

1289496_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	Cord Blood America, Inc. s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P7_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P8_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P8_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1289496_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cord Blood America, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has sustained recurring operating losses, continues to consume cash in operating activities, and has insufficient working capital and an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P11_S2	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

1289496_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	CBAI has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $42.8 million as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	In addition, CBAI has consumed cash in its operating activities of approximately $4.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2010 and has a working capital deficit of $4.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Management has been able, thus far, to finance the losses and the growth of the business, through private placements of its common stock, the issuance of debt and proceeds from the Equity Distribution Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement, and expects to continue to raise funds through debt and equity instruments.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	CBAI is continuing to attempt to increase revenues within its core businesses and through acquiring other businesses in the stem cell industry.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	In addition, the Company has taken steps to reduce its overall spending through the reduction of our labor force.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P29_S3	The ongoing execution of CBAI's business plan is expected to result in operating losses over the next twelve months.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P29_S4	There are no assurances that CBAI will be successful in achieving its goals of increasing revenues and reaching profitability.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	In view of these conditions, CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its financing requirements, and to ultimately achieve profitable operations.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P30_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBAI and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, Cord, Stellacure GmbH, Biocordcell Argentina S.A., BodyCells, Properties and Rain.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood, advertising, commercial production and internet lead generation.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	Accounts receivable relating to deferred revenues are netted against deferred revenues for presentation purposes.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P33_S3	The allowance is reviewed periodically and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P33_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while major replacement and improvements are capitalized as additions to the related assets.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	Sales and disposals of assets are recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation from the related asset and accumulated depreciation accounts with any gain or loss credited or charged to income upon disposition.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships as part of the acquisition of the CorCell and CureSource assets in 2007 in addition to the acquisition of Biocordcell in 2010 (Note 3).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Intangible assets are stated at cost.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Amortization of intangible assets is computed using the sum of the years digits method, over an estimated useful life of 18 years.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	Estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows: 2011: $609,973; 2012: $569,252; 2013: $528,531; 2014: $487,811; 2015: $447,090.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P38_S3	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances are more likely than not to reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Cord has a non-controlling equity investment in ViviCells International, Inc., a privately held company in the business of providing cord blood stem cell and adult peripheral blood stem cell preservation services.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting as it owns more than 20% of the outstanding common stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over this company.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	As such, the investment is carried at cost less Cord's proportionate share of ViviCells net loss for the period since investment.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P39_S3	At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of this investment is $0.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Cord has a minority equity investment in China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company, and a privately held company organized to conduct a stem cell storage business in China.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company utilizes the cost method of accounting as it owns less than 20% of the outstanding common stock and only has the ability to exercise nominal, not signficant, influence over this company.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P40_S2	The cost of this investment is $0.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	"Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities"), requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and in accordance with ASC 815-40-15 (formerly EITF 00-19 "Accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock") to determine whether they should be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	At December 31, 2010, the Company adjusted its derivative liability to its fair value, and reflected the change in fair value, in its consolidated statement of operations.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables").
1289496_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Cord, Stellacure and Bio recognize revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Rain's revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about the ability to collect.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and/or the creditworthiness of our clients' customers, which is based on current published credit ratings, current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client's customer and other factors that we believe are relevant.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P47_S2	If we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	Rain recognizes revenue generated through per inquiry advertising as the per inquiry leads are delivered to the customer.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Costs for Cord, Stellacure, and Bio are incurred as umbilical cord blood is collected.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	These costs include the transportation of the umbilical cord blood from the hospital to the lab, the labs processing fees, and royalties.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company expenses costs in the period incurred.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	Costs for Rain include commercial production costs, lead generation costs and media buys.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	Advertising expenses totaled approximately $193,527 and $159,000 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P51_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that included the enactment date.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P51_S4	The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance based on the portion of tax benefits that more likely than not will not be realized.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P51_S5	There was a valuation allowance equal to 100% of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company follows guidance issued by the FASB with regard to its accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	Such guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taking authorities.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	Interest and penalties totaled $0 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company files income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and various state jurisdictions.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	For jurisdictions in which tax filings are prepared, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by state tax authorities for years through 2005 and by the IRS for years through 2006.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company s share-based employee compensation plans are described in Note 10.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718 (previously SFAS 123(R), Accounting for Stock-based Compensation (Revised 2004) ( 123(R) ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants, including employee stock options.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P55_S2	ASC 718 supersedes the Company s previous accounting under APB 25 and SFAS 123, for periods beginning in fiscal 2006.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB 107 relating to ASC 718.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of ASC 718.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	Net loss per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260 (formerly SFAS No. 128), Earnings per Share.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding of 5,419,994,236 and 2,479,335,673 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P57_S2	Outstanding options to acquire common stock and warrants are not included in the computation of net loss per common share because the effects of inclusion are anti-dilutive.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	Concentrations of credit risk (whether on or off balance sheet) that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions described below.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Relationships and agreements which could potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of the use of one source for the processing and storage of all umbilical cord blood and one source for the development and maintenance of a website.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company believes that alternative sources are available for each of these concentrations.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk could consist of cash balances maintained in excess of federal depository insurance limits.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high credit quality financial institutions.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	At times, cash and cash equivalent balances may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	To date, the Company has not experienced any such losses.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Level inputs, as defined by ASC 820-10, are as follows:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Level 2 other significant observable inputs for the assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	Level 3 significant unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2010 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	Derivatives liability was valued under the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2009 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Derivatives liability was valued under the Black-Scholes model, with the following assumptions:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the derivatives liability:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenues, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	The carrying amounts of the Company s notes receivable and notes payable approximates fair value based on the prevailing interest rates.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	Certain numbers in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	In January, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	The standard amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures to require additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurement.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	The standard does not change how fair values are measured.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	This new guidance amends the existing criteria for separating consideration received in multiple-deliverable arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable which is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence, or management estimates.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	Expanded disclosures related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are also required.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S4	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S5	Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P74_S6	The Company does not anticipate there will be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this guidance.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC 860, (formerly SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, and an amendment to SFAS No. 140 ).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	ASC 860 eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P75_S2	ASC 860 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	The adoption of ASC 860 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC 810 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	The amendments include: (1) the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, (2) a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and (3) changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest entity.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	ASC 810 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009 and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	The adoption of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-15, which changes the fair value accounting for liabilities.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	These changes clarify existing guidance that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, an entity is required to measure fair value using either a valuation technique that uses a quoted price of either a similar liability or a quoted price of an identical or similar liability when traded as an asset, or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurements, such as an income approach (e.g., present value technique).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	This guidance also states that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability and a quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 input fair value measurements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P80_S3	This ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2010.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	In March 2010, the Company acquired 138,712 Series B Shares of Stellacure, GmbH, which represents an ownership percentage of 51%, a German Limited Liability Company that is in the business of collecting, processing, and storing cord blood samples.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	The purchase price paid by the Company was EUR 501,000 (approximately $660,000).
1289496_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	Stellacure operates primarily in Germany; however, it established sales channels in Spain and Italy in 2009.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company intends to utilize these markets for immediate market penetration and an opportunity for growth throughout Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	In connection with the acquisition, the Company acquired the following assets and liabilities at fair value:
1289496_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	Given that Stellacure has operated at a loss for the past several years, has negative working capital as of the acquisition date, and has a limited operating history, the Company determined that the fair value of any intangible assets identified as well as the non-controlling interest was $0.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	As such, the Company recorded a charge of $820,471 to its consolidated statement of operations relating to the acquisition because the costs incurred in the acquisition were akin to a startup cost for the Company s expansion into Europe.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	In connection with the purchase of the shares of Stellacure, the Company entered into a commitment to purchase the shares of Stellacure from the remaining holders, at the option of the holders, in either cash, shares of the Company, or a combination of both.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	The commitment price is defined in the shareholder agreement and is based on a formula that considers a multiple of revenue and earnings of Stellacure.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P86_S2	Should the Company pay the commitment price in shares of its common stock, it is required under the agreement that the holders be given stock equal to 110% of the commitment price.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P86_S3	The commitment commences in 2012 and expires in 2014.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P86_S4	The Company valued this commitment as of December 31, 2010, based on the recent earnings activity of Stellacure, and determined that the value of the commitment was $0.
1289496_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.1% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).

1289496_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	The Warrants have a five year term and are exercisable at an option exercise price of $0.05 per share per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 644,888 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	The plan was scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	However, Vivi subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	On April 13, 2011, the Company filed a Non Consummation of Confirmed Plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Company pursued its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all assets of NeoCells, ViviCells subsidiary.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	Then, on April 22, 2011, ViviCells filed an adversary proceeding against the Company, in the same United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana), where ViviCells bankruptcy proceedings had been taking place (the Adversary Proceeding ).
1289496_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	ViviCells followed this by, in the Adversary Proceeding, filing a Motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2011, seeking to halt the foreclosure by the Company on the assets of NeoCells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	The complaint and the motion were amended on May 2, 2011, primarily by adding NeoCells, in addition to ViviCells, as a party to the adversary proceeding and the motion.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The motion was heard on May 2, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	The motion was denied, and accordingly, the Company proceeded on May 2, 2011 at 1:00 pm (CST) to foreclose against all assets of NeoCells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	At the public disposition of all property owned by NeoCells, the Company as a secured creditor bid $320,000 in offset debt, and acquired all right, title and interest in said property free and clear of any liens, security interests and encumbrances which are junior and subordinate to the Company s security interest as a secured creditor.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	On June 2, 2011, the Court entered an order dismissing the Adversary Proceeding, and on July 11, 2011, the Court entered an Order Closing Adversary Proceeding.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	On February 24, 2011, the Company acquired the following assets; 593 umbilical cord blood samples and all related file documents, four (4) cryogenic storage tanks, and two computers from Reproductive Genetics Institute, Inc. (RGI) for $76,000 in cash.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Company paid an additional $48,885 to RGI to cover claims related to ViviCells International for a total $124,885.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	In March 2011, the assets acquired were relocated to the Company s Las Vegas laboratory.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2010 and continuing in 2011, the Company has also entered into three separate letters of intent, two nonbinding and one binding, contemplating the acquisition of three separate operating companies in the stem cell industry.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Acquisition was contingent on completion of ongoing due diligence review to the Company s satisfaction, and the Company s successfully obtaining new capital on commercially reasonable terms to fund one or more, or all of these acquisitions.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	One of these acquisitions is Cryo-Cell de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ( Cryo Mexico ) - see discussion under litigation below).
1289496_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	Another is a US Stem Cell Company, and a third is a South American Stem Cell Company.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P25_S4	The Company has concluded its diligence and capital raise opportunities, and is no longer pursuing these three acquisitions.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	As a publicly traded small cap company, Cord Blood is reliant on a private entity, the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ), to permit its publicly traded shares to be eligible for electronic stock transactions.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	The DTC is the only entity of its kind and is essentially unregulated.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	In December, 2010, the DTC unilaterally and without consultation with the Company, chilled all newly issued shares of the Company which were entitled to be freely traded in the market and whose holders expected to utilize the DTC Electronic Trading System.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	The DTC has since removed the chill, as described in more detail herein.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	Under what the DTC calls a chill , the DTC precludes shares which it has unilaterally chilled from utilizing its Electronic Stock Transfer System, thereby putting the holders of such chilled shares at extreme disadvantage in the trading market when they go to sell their shares.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	The chill applied to all shares newly issued after the chill went into effect on December 14, 2010, as well as all shares newly freed from private placement sales restrictions after the chill went into effect.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S4	The chill included as to the Company, even shares for which an effective registration statement is in place, and shares for which valid legal opinions have been issued by seasoned securities law counsel opining as to share entitlement to free trading status under SEC Rule 144.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S5	The SEC File Number of the aforementioned registration statement, a Form S-1 filing, is 333-164844, which said registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on May 11, 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S6	The chill fortunately did not apply to existing publicly traded shares of the Company which were out in the market place.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S7	The holders of the chilled shares of the Company are the investors whose funds have been supporting CBAI with capital lines to fund its expanding business.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P27_S8	Implementation of the DTC chill made it more difficult and costly for the Company to obtain new capital.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Company is unsure as to the DTC s reasons for its original issuance of the chill.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	No formal written reasons were given to the Company by the DTC regarding their reasons for the chill, in spite of the Company s efforts to uncover any such purported reasons.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	The Company s management believes the chill was unreasonable and that there was and is no valid, legal reason for the chill.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	In March 2011, the Company, through outside counsel, had a conversation with the DTC during which a number of items were discussed, though no reasons were given for the DTC s chill of the Company s stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Among the issues discussed were: whether an investor in the Company was a registered broker dealer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and if not, whether it needed to be; the details regarding the free up from restriction of shares issued to an investor; and whether an investor could be construed to be a Control Person under the 33 Act.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company does not believe the DTC considered the Company to be in violation under any of the foregoing circumstances at the time of the conversation, only that the DTC wanted to discuss the issues with the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	In response to and as a follow up to the discussion, the Company provided a letter, along with accompanying materials in April 2011 in an effort to alleviate any of the DTC s potential concerns, though again, no reasons for the chill were actually cited by the DTC during the discussion.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	During additional discussions with the DTC and its outside counsel regarding the chill, commencing in or around August, 2011, the DTC requested that some additional information be added to an opinion that was submitted by the Company to the DTC in June 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	The additional information included: an itemization of the dates share issuances were made by the Company to holders during a timeframe from January 2009 through September 2010; a statement that no additional consideration was paid at the time of conversion under any warrants or convertible notes during this timeframe; a statement that the share issuances at issue were made by the Company to the holders, and not to the holders from a third party; and information indicating that none of the holders has owned more than 9.99% of the Company s outstanding stock at any given time.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Company does not believe the DTC was under the impression the Company was in violation under any of these scenarios, but merely that the DTC wanted this information stated in the aforementioned opinion.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	The Company had previously given much of this information to the DTC in some format or another.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P30_S4	The Company was forced to negotiate settlement agreements with its existing investors to settle alleged breaches of contract as a result of this DTC chill and the unavailability of DTC electronic transfer for chilled Company shares.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	a. Liquidated Damages Agreement with JMJ Financial.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Under previous outstanding Company Convertible Notes issued to JMJ and funded by JMJ in the amount of approximately $1,750,000 executed on March 24, 2010, March 26, 2010, October 7, 2010 and January 12, 2011 (the Earlier Notes ), the Company was obligated to deliver common shares which could be placed into the Automated System for Deposits and Withdrawals of Securities (known as DWAC ).
1289496_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	At present the DWAC system is not available to Company shareholders for newly issued shares of the Company s common stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	As a result of this, on February 8, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement and liquidated damages agreement (the Liquidated Damages Agreement ) with JMJ which contained the following terms, among others:
1289496_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Pursuant to this Liquidated Damages Agreement, the Company agreed to pay $671,385 in liquidated damages to JMJ said sum to be added to the principal amount of the Earlier Note.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	The investor was also granted the option to rescind any future conversion of portions of the principal amount of the Earlier Note, and or the 2011 Note into the Company s common stock, and convert JMJ s interest back into debt owed by the Company, and later at JMJ s option, to convert back again into Company common stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The per share conversion price on JMJ s conversions of the Earlier Note and the 2011 Note was changed from a 15% discount, to a 25% discount from the Company share price, calculated as the lesser of $.0041, or the average of the 5 lowest traded prices for the Company s common stock in the 20 trading days preceding the date of each conversion into common stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Liquidated Damages Agreement also added a 35% prepayment penalty for prepayment of any previously funded portions of any Company Note, past or future , and a 15% cancelation fee for cancellation of any portion of any past or future Company Note which had not been funded.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Due to the foregoing, the Company paid liquidated damages to JMJ in the total amount of $671,385.00, all of which was paid prior to March 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Company will not incur any additional liquidated damages to JMJ as a result of the foregoing.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	b. Liquidated Damages Agreement with Tangiers Capital, LLC.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	On January 19, 2011, the Company entered into a separate settlement and liquidated damages agreement (the Agreement ), with Tangiers Capital, LLC ( Tangiers), one of the Company s existing investment bankers which has been purchasing from time to time registered shares of the Company s Common Stock for cash.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	Execution of the Agreement became necessary because under the existing agreement with Tangiers, entered June 27, 2008, the Company was obligated to deliver registered shares which could be immediately placed into the Automated System for Deposits and Withdrawals of Securities (known as DWAC ), and at present the DWAC system is not available for newly issued registered shares of the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Agreement provides that as Liquidated Damages, the Company will remit a specified sum (the Penalty Sum ) to Tangiers on each share the investor has previously purchased and currently holds, and on each share purchased Tangiers for cash in the future, until such time as the shares held by Tangiers can again be deposited into the DWAC system.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Shares can only be purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future at the Company s election, as the June 27, 2008 agreement works in a manner similar to a credit line.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Penalty Sum is to be calculated as follows: A sum equal to:
1289496_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	(iii) Less a sum equal to:
1289496_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	In the case of shares acquired during the specified period and not sold at the date on which the DWAC System is again available, a sum equal to the closing price for Cord common Stock on the date that newly issued shares of the Company s common stock can again use the DWAC System.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the DTC s chill, had cost the Company approximately $246,000 in damages stemming from the above-described agreement with Tangiers, which the Company has already paid to Tangiers.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Further, additional damages may be alleged, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the settlement agreement with Tangiers, and as stated above, the amount is uncertain.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	As to potential future damages, shares can only be purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future at the Company s election, as the June 27, 2008 agreement works in a manner similar to a credit line.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	Thus, it is possible no such damages would become due.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P44_S4	Even though the chill has been removed, the Company has not yet been readmitted to the DTC s FAST program, including DWAC, as further described herein, such that in the event the Company elects to allow Tangiers to purchase shares for cash in the future, Tangiers may argue that a Penalty Sum may still be due from the Company to Tangiers using the above-referenced formula.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	Now that the chill has been removed, the Company is no longer in a Custody Only status.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Company is considered DTC Eligible.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	This status allows brokers to send physical share certificates to DTC for the benefit of their client shareholders at which point the certificates are deposited into the DTC system.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	Once the certificate clears the transfer process they are credited into the DTC system and future trades can be conducted and settled electronically.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	At present all shares of the Company s stock fall under the DTC categorizations described herein, in contrast to when the chill was in effect and some shares of the Company s stock were subject to the chill, while others were not.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Company does not believe additional expenses will be incurred by shareholders and investors in making sales or purchases of the Company s stock due to FAST services being unavailable.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	It may take several additional days for investors who receive physical shares of the Company s stock from the Company in fulfillment of the Company s financing arrangements or who, for other reasons, receive physical shares of stock, to deposit these physical stock certificates into the DTC system, as a result of the Company not being eligible for FAST services.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	There should not, however, be an increase in time necessary to purchase and sell the Company s common stock that is already in the DTC system.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	While the chill was in effect, the Company accessed capital from investors in a total amount of $2,684,062.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	Of this total $937,000 was from Tangiers, $1,000,000 was from JMJ Financial ( JMJ ), and $747,062 was from St. George Investments, LLC ( St. George ).
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Of the amount obtained by the Company from Tangiers, $512,000 stemmed from the June, 28, 2008 agreement between the Company and Tangiers.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	As described herein, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Tangiers which provided for $246,000 as damages as a result of the DTC chill, which thereby made this source of capital more costly to the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	$250,000 of the remaining amount obtained from Tangiers during this period was accessed by the Company pursuant to two promissory notes issued by the Company to Tangiers in June, 2011, as described in more detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this filing.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	Under these documents, though no monetary damages are due to Tangiers as a result of the chill or as a result of the Company not being DWAC eligible, Tangiers conversion rate is 70% of the lowest volume weighted average price (VWAP) during the ten (10) days prior to conversion while the Company is not DWAC eligible, whereas this conversion rate would be 77.5% of the lowest volume weighted average price (VWAP) during the ten (10) days prior to conversion, if the Company were DWAC eligible.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S4	The remaining $100,000 accessed from Tangiers while the chill was in effect stems from four separate $25,000 notes, entered in July and August of 2011, the details of which are set forth in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this filing.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S5	The conversion rate on these notes is the lower of 70% of the lowest volume weighted average price (VWAP) during the 10 days prior to conversion or 70% of the average of the lowest 5 trading days over the 20 days prior to conversion.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P49_S6	The Company believes that if it would have been DWAC eligible at the time the notes were issued, it may have been able to negotiate a better discount arrangement with Tangiers, thereby resulting in a lower cost of this capital.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	As also described herein, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with JMJ due to the chill that resulted in $671,385 as damages.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Part of this damages are attributable to the $1,000,000 accessed from JMJ during the chill, though the damages amount pertains to all capital accessed from the notes which are governed by the settlement agreement, not just the $1,000,000 received by the Company from JMJ while the chill was in effect.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	The Company will not incur additional monetary damages to JMJ under that settlement agreement, however, under the settlement agreement, the discount rate on JMJ s conversions of the Earlier Note and the 2011Note was changed in JMJ s favor, and in addition, the settlement agreement added a prepayment penalty for any previously funded portions of any JMJ note and added a cancellation fee for any portion of any past or future JMJ note which has not yet been funded, all as set forth in more detail in this section of this filing.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Regarding amounts of capital obtained from St. George while the chill was in effect, the convertible promissory notes that govern this capital are set forth herein.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	Due to the Company not being DWAC eligible, the conversion rate at which St. George may convert its convertible promissory notes into shares of the Company s common stock has been reduced from 80% to 70%.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Aside from the conversion rate reduction, St. George has made no claims for additional, monetary damages as a result of the Company not being DWAC eligible.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Since the DTC removed the chill on or around November 16, 2011, the Company has accessed $75,000 of capital from investors, all of which came from Tangiers.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	Under the Convertible Notes the Company entered with Tangiers in order to receive this capital, Tangiers conversion rate is the lower of 70% of the lowest volume weighted average price (VWAP) during the 10 days prior to conversion or 70% of the average of the lowest 5 trading days over the 20 days prior to conversion.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	The Company believes that if it were DWAC eligible, it may have been able to negotiate a better discount arrangement with Tangiers.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P54_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P54_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P55_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P61_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and very useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove approximately one liter of bone marrow.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P63_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	According to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, over 45,000 bone marrow and other hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant procedures were performed worldwide in 2002.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	In the past decade, several public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and preservation of these cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	This blood is preserved and made available for a significant fee to anyone who needs it in the future.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	We do not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Private, or family, cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	This blood is preserved and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Stem cells have been successfully recovered from cord blood after at least twenty years of storage in liquid nitrogen.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	However, these cells may be able to retain their usefulness at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Cord s customers are typically expectant parents who choose to collect and store umbilical cord blood at the birth of their child for potential use in a stem cell transplant at a later date for that child or for another family member.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	With the opening of the lab in Las Vegas, NV, Cord is able to provide services to collect, test, process and preserve umbilical cord blood.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Private cord blood banking has been growing in acceptance by the medical community and has become increasingly popular with families.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	For an initial fee of approximately $1,950 and an annual storage fee of approximately $125 for each year thereafter, Cord provides the following services to each customer:
1289496_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	We provide a kit that contains all of the materials necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for later testing.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	We provide 24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood maternal blood samples.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	We manage all logistics for transporting the cord blood unit to our centralized facility immediately following birth.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P76_S1	This procedure ensures chain-of-custody control during transportation for maximum security.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	At the laboratory, the cord blood sample is tested for stem cell concentration levels and blood type.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	The cord blood sample and the maternal blood sample are also tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	We report these results to both the mother and her doctor.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least eighteen years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	PharmaStem Therapeutics holds certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	In the past ten years, PharmaStem has commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of our competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P80_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P80_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners may, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem technology and processes covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P80_S4	All of the patents expired in 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	Other than royalties, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P81_S3	As of 2008, Cord has ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P81_S4	The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P81_S5	As of December 31, 2011, the Company included approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 included in accrued expenses to account for this liability since 2008.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	On October 13, 2006, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vita34 for the assets of CorCell, Inc., to begin the process of acquiring the business of collection, processing and storage of blood taken from umbilical cord after a child is born.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	On February 28, 2007, we completed the acquisition.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	The acquisition related to all rights to possession and custody of all acquired samples owned by CorCell, Inc. and associated with the operations of CorCell, Inc., which is predominantly the current customer base and revenues.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	The deal also included the purchase of cryogenic freezers and other fixed assets used in this umbilical cord blood samples business.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P82_S4	These cryogenic freezers were moved to our Las Vegas facilities on March 8, 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	On August 20, 2007, we completed the acquisition of specific assets from CureSource, Inc., for the aggregate purchase price of $106,500 in cash and $10,000 value paid in common restricted shares of the company, for a total purchase price of $116,500.

1289496_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	In connection with convertible debt financing consummated in February of 2007 with Shelter Island Opportunity Fund, LLC, the Company issued to the lender in that transaction a Put Agreement , whereby the Company agreed to purchase from the Lender up to 360,000 shares of its common stock from the lender at a fixed purchase price of $5.00 per share, or for a total of up to $1,800,000 if the Put is exercised in full.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	The Put provides that if the Company is unable to, or chooses not to pay the Put price in cash, the Company can issue a convertible promissory note, bearing interest at 16% per annum during its initial 12 month term, and interest at 20% per annum thereafter, payable on a monthly basis over on a 24 month level amortization, secured by unspecified assets, and payable at the Company s option by delivery of shares of its Common stock in lieu of cash.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	At the same time, the Company issued to the Lender a warrant to acquire 360,000 shares of its common stock, at a warrant exercise price of $10.1, subject to exercise price adjustment under certain circumstances.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	The exercise price as subsequently been adjusted under the warrant provisions and is currently fixed at $0.86 per share.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Lender in August of 2009 endeavored to exercise its rights under the Put without first exercising the warrant or otherwise acquiring shares of the Company s common stock which the Lender would be able to deliver to the Company as required by the Put.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	As a result of the Lender s inability to deliver to the Company shares of the Company s common stock as required by the Put, the Company declined to pay the cash Put price or deliver the convertible promissory note in satisfaction of the Put, and has taken the position that the Put has not been exercised.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	After extensive negotiations with Shelter Island, the parties entered into a transaction on July 21, 2010, whereby the 360,000 shares Warrant Agreement was canceled, and the obligation represented by the Put Option Agreement was satisfied by the Company's delivery to Shelter Island of a new Senior Secured Note in the principal amount of $1,590,400 (the "Replacement Note").
1289496_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	With this agreement, the derivative liability of $1,608,658 was reduced to $1,590,400 and then reclassified on the balance sheet as a note payable.

1289496_12_ITEM1_P88_S3	The Company, at its option, may pay the principal amount due on the Replacement Note by the issuance of unregistered Company Common Stock, to be valued at an agreed conversion rate that is fixed for this purpose, subject to certain adjustments, at 85% of the market value of the Company's common stock, calculated based on the five lowest daily closing prices for the stock over certain specified 20 day periods.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	On March 17, 2011, the parties entered into an Amendment for above said Replacement Note.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	The Amendment extends the commencement date of the six monthly installments each in the amount of $ 248,400 to April 30, 2011 in exchange for continued interest payments for February, March and April, along with a cash payment of $25,000 as an adjustment to the principal balance.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	Other terms of the Replacement Note remain for the most part the same.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	Shelter exercised its conversion rights under the Replacement note in 2011, in part.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	Specifically, as a result of conversions by Shelter, the Company issued a total of 5,562,038 shares, at a value of $568,134, to Shelter in 2011.

1289496_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	The Company has built its business in the United States ( US ) via a model of organic growth and accretive acquisitions.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	Management believes that in the US the organic differentiator for the company is its emphasis on strategic relationships with larger health insurance providers.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	This approach differs from our major competitors who tend to focus on a traditional pharmaceutical model by having sales reps cover a market by visiting ob/gyn practices.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	By focusing on the health insurance relationships, while the sales cycle is longer, once established, management believes the sales approach builds loyalty and reoccurring sales.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Company officially opened its own laboratory operations at its new facility in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 22, 2010.

1289496_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	Now, with this key expertise in house, the Company has the ability to continue making advancements on existing and new services related to stem cells as well as better manage laboratory costs related to processing and storage.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Management may add acquisitions that either increases the company's footprint, which may include international elements, and/or increase the reoccurring storage based revenues, assuming sufficient new sources of capital can be located to make such acquisitions.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	To date, the Company has concluded seven acquisitions, and management believes there exist multiple opportunities to acquire smaller competitors who do not have the resources to compete on a go forward basis.

1289496_12_ITEM1_P111_S1	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under Tranche 2, and elected to maintain its Pledge position with samples until further notice.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	On February 13, 2012, the Company paid in full its obligation, in connection with convertible debt financing consummated in February of 2007, with Shelter; and subsequent negotiations of the Put Agreement satisfied by the Company's delivery to Shelter Island of a new Senior Secured Note in the principal amount of $1,590,400.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	The remaining balance of the Note in 2012 was $369,692.56 and was acquired by Tangiers Capital.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	The Tangiers obligation was subsequently retired as well in 2012.
1289496_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	On January 12, 2012, HaVi Enterprises, LLC, in which the Company s COO Joseph Vicente owns a 50% interest, loaned $50,000 to the Company through a Secured Promissory Note with an interest rate of 12% per annum and a 6-month repayment schedule.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $48.7 million as of December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	In addition, we have a working capital deficit of approximately $4.9 million as of December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We had net losses of $6.0 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 1, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P0_S6	If we are unable to generate substantial revenues and/or unable to obtain additional financing to meet our working capital requirements, we may have to curtail our business or cease operations.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Currently, we are dependent upon external financing to fund our operations.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	It is imperative that we receive this external financing to implement our business plan and to finance ongoing operations.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	New capital may not be available, adequate funds may not be sufficient for our operations, or capital may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to our management.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our failure to obtain adequate additional financing would require us to delay, curtail or scale back some or all of our operations would hinder our ability to implement our business plans and could jeopardize our ability to continue our business.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We believe that the key to our success is to increase sales of our cord blood preservation services as well as our advertising services and thereby increase our revenues and available cash.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our success with regard to cord blood preservation services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-preservation of cord blood and our efforts to educate potential customers and sell our services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Broad use and acceptance of our service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We may not have the resources required to promote our services and their potential benefits.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Continued commercialization of our services will also require that we satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of our services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for our services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If we are unable to increase market acceptance of our services, we may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to achieve and then maintain profitability or to continue our operation.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The DTC Previously Effectuated a Chill on the Company s Stock, Since Removed, the Results of which Have an Adverse Impact on the Cost to the Company of Utilizing Existing Capital Sources.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In December, 2010, the DTC unilaterally and without consultation with the Company chilled all newly issued shares of the Company s common stock which were entitled to be freely traded in the market and whose holders expected to utilize the DTC Electronic Trading System.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Under what the DTC calls a chill, the DTC precludes shares which it has unilaterally chilled from utilizing its Electronic Stock Transfer System, thereby putting the holders of such chilled shares at a disadvantage in the trading market when they go to sell their shares.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	As a result of the chill, existing sources of funding for the Company became more costly.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Namely, the Company was forced to negotiate a settlement agreement with investor Tangiers Capital, LLC ( Tangiers ) to settle an alleged breach of contract as a result of this DTC chill.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Specifically: on January 19, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement and liquidated damages agreement (the Agreement ) with Tangiers.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Execution of the Agreement became necessary because under the existing agreement with Tangiers, entered June 27, 2008, the Company was obligated to deliver registered shares which could be immediately placed into the Automated System for Deposits and withdrawals of Securities (known as DWAC ).
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Agreement provided that as Liquidated Damages, the Company will remit a specified sum (the Penalty Sum ) to Tangiers on each share the investor has previously purchased and currently holds, and on each share purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future, until such time as the shares held by Tangiers can again be deposited into the DWAC system.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Company currently owes no damages for shares purchased by Tangiers in the past.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	As to potential future damages, shares can only be purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future at the Company s election, as the June 27, 2008 agreement works in a manner similar to a credit line.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Thus, it is possible no such damages will become due.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In the event the Company elects to allow Tangiers to purchase shares for cash in the future, Tangiers may argue that a Penalty Sum may be due from the Company to Tangiers, even though the DTC chill has been removed, because the Company is not eligible for the DTC s FAST program, including DWAC, which would thereby make this capital source more costly to the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The formula for calculating any such Penalty Sum is provided Item 1.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Business under Events in 2011, Other, of this filing, along with extensive additional details pertaining to Liquidated Damages already paid to Tangiers, the chill the FAST program, the Company s DTC status, and related details.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	As also described in Events 2011, located under Other, the Company was forced to enter into the February 8, 2011 settlement agreement with JMJ Financial ( JMJ ) due to the chill for the same or similar reasons the Company was forced to enter the above described settlement agreement with Tangiers, which resulted in $671,385 as monetary damages.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Company will not incur additional monetary damages to JMJ under that settlement agreement, however, under the settlement agreement, the discount rate on JMJ s conversions of the notes governed by the settlement agreement was changed in JMJ s favor, and in addition, the settlement agreement added a prepayment penalty for any previously funded portions of any JMJ note and added a cancellation fee for any portion of any past or future JMJ note which has not yet been funded, all as set forth in more detail in Events 2011, located under Other, of this filing.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	St. George was not a capital source for the Company prior to the DTC effectuating the chill, and as such, is described more fully in Note 8.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A further breakdown regarding the amount of capital obtained by the Company from each these entities while the chill was in effect and since the chill has been removed, as well as additional costs of this capital as a result of the chill, is provided in the Events 2011, located under Other of this filing.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may be liable to our customers and may lose customers if we provide poor service, if our services do not comply with our agreements or if our storage facilities fail.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We must meet our customers service level expectations and our contractual obligations with respect to our services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Failure to do so could subject us to liability, as well as cause us to lose customers.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In some cases, we rely upon third party contractors to assist us in providing our services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our ability to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of our third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Any material disruption in our ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate us for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If We Do Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, We May Not Be Able To Market Our Cord Blood Banking Services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The cord blood banking services that we provide are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The cord blood facility we use has registered with the FDA as a cord blood banking service, listed its products with the FDA, and will be subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, the FDA has proposed new good tissue practice regulations that would establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as proposed rules for donor suitability.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Consistent with industry practice, our cord blood collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The FDA has announced that it will implement more regulatory procedures for cord blood banking in 2006.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	This new regulation may require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval for the collection kits.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Securing any necessary medical device clearance or approval for the cord blood collection kits may involve the submission of a substantial volume of data and may require a lengthy substantive review.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	This would increase costs and could reduce profitability.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The FDA could also require that we cease using the collection kit and require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval prior to further use of the kits.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	This could cause us to cease operations for some period of time.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Of the states in which we provide cord blood banking services, only California, New Jersey , New York, and Maryland currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We maintain the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York and New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood banking services, either the cord blood storage facility, or we may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Because Our Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, Our Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Our Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services we provide.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for our services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We believe that our future success will depend largely on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of our customers.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Expectant parents may not use our services and our services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	And, In The Event We Are Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Our Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Cord blood banking and stem cell preservation is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our business faces competition from other operators of cord blood and stem cell preservation businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter our markets and compete with us.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than we do.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	We do not have any research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such R D. Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than us, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than we currently attract.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In the event that we are not able to compete successfully, our business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for us to grow our revenue and maintain our existing business.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm Us.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If our information systems fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company s sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as the current recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on our services.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Recent volatility in the financial market may negatively impact the Company s ability to access the credit markets.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors while the Company currently requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Our Operations.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew L. Schissler, and our Chief Operating Officer, Joseph Vicente.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The loss of either s services could materially harm our business because of the cost and time necessary to find their successor.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We do not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on either Executive Officer.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We also have other key employees who manage our operations and if we were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P30_S5	To the extent that we are smaller than our competitors and have fewer resources, we may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Trading of our stock may be restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	In October, 2009, we re-located our headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our new principal office and laboratory operations are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	This facility encompasses approximately 17,000 square feet.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The property is leased from an unaffiliated third party for a period of 5 years ending September 2014.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	The monthly lease payments are approximately $15,303, which includes Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S5	We continue to be responsible for our previous principal office located in Santa Monica, CA until September, 2012, where we leased approximately 2, 200 square feet at a monthly lease cost of approximately $9,500.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S6	As of October 2010, we have been able to sublease the Santa Monica, CA property.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P0_S7	The property has been sub-leased for $6,297 per month, commencing January 2011 and is to continue for the remainder of the lease which terminates on September 30, 2012.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We maintain fire and casualty insurance on our leased property in an amount deemed adequate by management.
1289496_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	The German and Argentina subsidiaries both lease facilities for operations in Hamburg, Germany and Buenos Aires, Argentina respectively.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company, as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 644,889 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	The plan was scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P2_S4	However, Vivi subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	On April 13, 2011, the Company filed a Non Consummation of Confirmed Plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	The Company pursued its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all assets of NeoCells, ViviCells subsidiary.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	Then, on April 22, 2011, ViviCells filed an adversary proceeding against the Company, in the same United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana), where ViviCells bankruptcy proceedings had been taking place.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P3_S3	ViviCells followed this by filing a Motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2011, seeking to halt the foreclosure by the Company on the assets of NeoCells.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P3_S4	The complaint and the motion were amended on May 2, 2011, primarily by adding NeoCells, in addition to ViviCells, as a party to the adversary proceeding and the motion.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	The motion was heard on May 2, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	The motion was denied, and accordingly, the Company proceeded on May 2, 2011 at 1:00 pm (CST) to foreclose against all assets of NeoCells.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	At the public disposition of all property owned by NeoCells, the Company as a secured creditor bid $320,000 in offset debt, and acquired all right, title and interest in said property free and clear of any liens, security interests and encumbrances which are junior and subordinate to the Company s security interest as a secured creditor.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	On June 2, 2011, the Court entered an order dismissing the adversary proceeding, and on July 11, 2011, the Court entered an Order Closing Adversary Proceeding.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	On December 16, 2010, Cryo-Cell International, Inc. ( Cryo International ) filed an action against Cord Blood America, Inc. (the Company ) in The Sixth Judicial Circuit Court, Pinellas County, Florida alleging claims for: tortious interference with a business relationship; misappropriate of trade secrets and confidential information in violation of the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 688.001, Et.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	Stat.; dilution of trademark in violation of 495.151, Fla.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	Stat.; and Common Law Unfair Competition.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P7_S0	Cryo International, a competitor of the Company, filed the suit apparently in an effort to stop the Company s pursuit of the acquisition of Cryo-Cell de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. ( Cryo Mexico ), for which the Company had in place a non binding Letter of Intent for acquisition.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P7_S1	In addition, along with its Complaint, Cryo International filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Injunction.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P7_S2	In January 2011, the Company filed a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Cryo International s Emergency Motion for Temporary Injunction, and a Rule 1.140(b) Motion to Dismiss Cryo International s complaint, as well as amendments to these documents.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P7_S3	The Emergency Motion for a Temporary Injunction, Motion to Dismiss and related filings were heard by the Court on January 14, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P7_S4	The Court granted the Company s Motion to Dismiss, finding that Cryo Mexico was an indispensible party to the lawsuit and granted Cryo International leave to file an amended complaint to add Cryo Mexico as a defendant to the lawsuit and to serve Cryo Mexico with the required legal papers.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P8_S0	Cryo International filed an Amended Complaint on January 20, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P8_S1	The Amended Complaint added Cryo Mexico as a defendant to the action, asserted all of the original causes of action against the Company, and added a claim for Breach of a License Agreement against Cryo Mexico and a claim for Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices in violation of 501.201, Et.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P8_S2	Stat. against Cryo Mexico and the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM3_P8_S3	Cryo International also filed an amended motion for temporary injunction.

1289496_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	CBAI is primarily an umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation company with a particular focus on the acquisition of customers in need of family based products and services.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	The umbilical cord blood stem cell preservation operations provide umbilical cord blood banking services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our corporate headquarters re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA in October 2009.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	In March 2010, we began to process and store cord blood in our own facility.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	We provide the following services to each customer.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We provide a medical kit that contains all of the materials necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for later testing.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	We provide 24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood maternal blood samples.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We coordinate the transportation of the cord blood unit to our laboratory in Las Vegas, immediately following birth.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	This process utilizes a private medical courier, Airnet, for maximum efficiency and security.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	At the laboratory, the cord blood sample is tested for stem cell concentration levels, bacteria and blood type.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The maternal blood sample is tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	We report these results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least fifteen years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, both through organic growth and acquisition.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Based in Hamburg Germany, Stellacure GmbH collects, processes and stores cord blood samples as a private bank for use in current or future medical therapies in Germany, Spain, and other European and Middle Eastern Countries.

1289496_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In 2010, management has reduced the activities of Rain, terminated its former employees, and is no longer seeking business.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	This is consistent with management s decision to focus its attention on the stem cell storage business and related activities.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	We are continuing to pursue other growth opportunities by acquisition or internal growth.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The development of BodyCells, which is anticipated to facilitate the collecting, processing and preserving of peripheral blood and adipose tissue stem cells allowing individuals to privately preserve their stem cells for potential future use in stem cell therapy, is currently suspended pending the identification of an alternative lab to partner with.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	We define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require estimates and assumptions based on our judgment of changing market conditions and the performance of our assets and liabilities at any given time.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	In determining which accounting policies meet this definition, we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following:
1289496_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood, placenta collection and whole cord blood collection, advertising, commercial production and internet lead generation.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Accounts receivable relating to deferred revenues are netted against deferred revenue for presentation purposes.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	The allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Cord provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force (Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, ).
1289496_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees are recognized upon the completion of processing.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about the ability to collect.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and/or the creditworthiness of our clients customers, which is based on current published credit ratings, current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customer and other factors that we believe are relevant.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	If we determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash payment.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Franchise revenues which are part of Biocordcells current income are recognized in accordance with ASC 952-605-3, according to requirements for recognizing franchise revenues after franchise agreement services are completed and substantially performed.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Further, in accordance with ASC 952-605-25-7, the installment or cost recovery accounting method shall be used to account for a franchise fee revenue only in those exceptional cases when revenue is collectible over an extended period and no reasonable basis exists for estimated collectability.

1289496_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess the market conditions, particularly related to the cost of customer acquisition, both organic growth and M A activity and whether they will lead to profitability.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We are continuing to pursue other growth opportunities by acquisition or internal growth.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The development of BodyCells, which is anticipated to facilitate the collecting, processing and preserving of peripheral blood and adipose tissue stem cells allowing individuals to privately preserve their stem cells for potential future use in stem cell therapy, is currently suspended pending the identification of an alternative lab to partner with.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, our total revenue increased $1.54 million, or 37% to $5.67 million as compared to $4.13 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Cord s revenues were $3.47 million, while Stellacure s revenues contributed $0.59 million, and Biocordcell s revenues contributed $1.61 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in revenue overall, is due to growth in our customer list, revenue generation from the placenta project, which contributed $0.15 million, and the 2010 acquisitions of Stellacure and Biocordcell as-well-as the addition of Neocells customer lists in 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Cord s annual storage fees increased approximately $0.45 million, or 20.4% from the prior comparative year, to approximately $2.65 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Cord remains focused on strategic organic growth and accretive acquisition strategies, which management hopes will reduce or eliminate the losses and negative operating cash flow.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Cost of services increased $0.23 million to $1.86 million, and gross profit which is 67% increased by $1.3 million, or 52% to $3.8 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase is a result of adding the acquisitions of Stellacure Biocordcell, acquiring samples from Neocells as well as bringing lab processing in house in 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	The 2011 costs for operating the Placenta project has remained at $0.1 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	The company anticipates that through the growth and expansion of our Cord business, and the processing and storage of the cord blood in our own facilities, our direct costs should decrease and our gross margins increase.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Administrative and selling expenses decreased by $0.7 million to a total of $7.6 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	This decrease was due to reducing overhead and administrative expenses in the U.S.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	Our interest expense and change in derivatives liability increased by approximately $0.66 million or 37 % to approximately $2.1 million in 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	The primary reason for this increase is due to the DWAC settlement on the JMJ share issuance.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our total net loss decreased approximately $2.1 million, or 26% from $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Of the $6.0 million net loss in 2011, $3.9 million was related to non-cash expenses made up of $2.5 million in interest and changes in derivative liabilities, $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization, $0.9 million related to DWAC settlement charges, and $0.2 million for stock option expenses.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	We have experienced net losses of $6.0 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	At December 31, 2011, we had $0.2 million in cash.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	We currently collect cash receipts from operations through Cord and both of our subsidiaries, Biocordcells and Stellacure.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P39_S3	Cash flows from operations are not currently sufficient to fund operations in combination with these corporate expenses.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P39_S4	During 2011 our Notes payable decreased by $2.2 million through equity issuances.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net cash used in operating activities decreased approximately $2.5 million from the prior comparative year to $1.9 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease was a result in the reduction of stock based compensation of $0.2 million as compared to $2.2 million recognized in 2010 .
1289496_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately $1.8 million from the prior comparative year to $2.7million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	This decrease was due to a reduction in the issuance of notes payable amounting to $2.2 million as compared to 2010 in the amount of $4.2 million .
1289496_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	During the year, cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $0.15 million from the prior comparative year to $0.2 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Since inception, we have financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and repayments on loans.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	As we expand our operational activities, we may continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations and we will be required to obtain additional financing to fund operations through equity offerings and borrowings to the extent necessary to provide working capital.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Financing may not be available, and, if available, it may not be available on acceptable terms.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Should we secure such financing, it could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	The sale of debt would, among other things, adversely impact our balance sheet, increase our expenses and increase our cash flow requirements.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	The sale of equity could, among other things, result in dilution to our shareholders.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S6	If our cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then we would either need to cut back on our budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P41_S7	If we are unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products, we could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2011, our total assets were $7.35 million as compared to $7.38 million as of December 31, 2010, or a decrease of approximately 0.4 %.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	As of December 31, 2011, total liabilities increased approximately 24 % to $8.2 million as compared to approximately $6.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase is due to growth in deferred revenue which increased by $0.2 million, Cord s accounts payable have increased by approximately $0.3 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	Our derivative liability has increased approximately $0.73 million to $0.97 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	During the year, our notes payable have increased approximately $0.59 million to $2.3 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	At December 31, 2011, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $4.9 million.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	We will continue to carry a deficit until such time, if ever, that we can increase our assets and reduce our significant liabilities which are currently composed of notes payable, derivatives liability, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenues.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	This new guidance amends the existing criteria for separating consideration received in multiple-deliverable arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable which is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence, or management estimates.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	Expanded disclosures related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are also required.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	This guidance is effective for the Company beginning fiscal year 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P46_S5	Upon adoption, the guidance may be applied either prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year for new or materially modified arrangements, or it may be applied retrospectively.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2011-04 ), which amended ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820 ), providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles, clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the disclosure requirements.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	ASU 2011-04 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2011-05 ).
1289496_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	ASU 2011-05 requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	ASU 2011-05 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012 and is to be applied retrospectively.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P49_S3	The adoption of ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ), which amends the guidance in ASC 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill .
1289496_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	ASU 2011-08 provides entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined, based on qualitative factors, to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, the entities are required to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	ASU 2011-08 will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.
1289496_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The adoption of ASU 2011-08 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
1289496_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Our consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedule and notes thereto as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and for each of the two years then ended, together with the independent registered public accounting firm s reports thereon, are set forth on pages F-1 to F-23 of this Annual Report.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	It is management's responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer, our chief operations officer, and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The deficiency in our disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	We continue to actively search for additional capital in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P9_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P9_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The deficiency in our internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P10_S1	We continue to actively search for additional capital in order to be in position to add the necessary staff to address this material weakness.
1289496_12_ITEM9A_P10_S2	We are also assessing how we can improve our internal control over financial reporting with the current number of employees in an effort to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.

1289496_12_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following is a discussion of our program for compensating our named executive officers and directors.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P1_S1	Currently, we do not have a compensation committee, and as such, our Board of Directors is responsible for determining the compensation of our named executive officers.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P2_S0	The primary goals of our policy of executive compensation are to attract and retain the most talented and dedicated executives possible, to assure that our executives are compensated effectively in a manner consistent with our strategy and competitive practice and to align executives compensation with the achievement of our short- and long-term business objectives.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P3_S0	The board of directors considers a variety of factors in determining compensation of executives, including their particular background and circumstances, such as their training and prior relevant work experience, their success in attracting and retaining savvy and technically proficient managers and employees, increasing our revenues, broadening our product line offerings, managing our costs and otherwise helping to lead our Company through a period of rapid growth.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P4_S0	In the near future, we expect that our board of directors will form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs of our Company and with the full authority to determine and approve the compensation of our chief executive officer and make recommendations with respect to the compensation of our other executive officers.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P4_S1	We expect that our compensation committee will continue to follow the general approach to executive compensation that we have followed to date, rewarding superior individual and company performance with commensurate cash compensation.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P5_S0	Our compensation program for the named executive officers consists primarily of base salary.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P5_S1	There is no retirement plan, long-term incentive plan or other such plans, although Mr. Schissler s and Mr. Vicente s agreements have a bonus plan, subject to the Board s discretion.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P6_S0	The base salary we provide is intended to equitably compensate the named executive officers based upon their level of responsibility, complexity and importance of role, leadership and growth potential, and experience.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P7_S0	Our named executive officers receive base salaries commensurate with their roles and responsibilities.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P7_S1	Base salaries and subsequent adjustments, if any, are reviewed and approved by our board of directors annually, based on an informal review of relevant market data and each executive s performance for the prior year, as well as each executive s experience, expertise and position.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P7_S2	The base salaries paid to our named executive officers in 2011 are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1289496_12_ITEM11_P8_S0	We have previously provided equity awards as a component of compensation.

1289496_12_ITEM13_P6_S0	CBAI engaged Frozen Food Gift Group, Inc. ( FFGG ) as a vendor, prepaying for $45,000 in products during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM13_P6_S1	The remaining balance on that account is approximately $30,000.
1289496_12_ITEM13_P7_S0	The Company s CEO and Chairman of the Board, Mathew Schissler, owns 41.4% of the outstanding shares of FFGG, and is FFGG s Chairman of the Board.
1289496_12_ITEM13_P7_S1	CBAI s COO Joseph Vicente served on the Board of Directors of FFGG, but resigned, effective as of January 26, 2012.
1289496_12_ITEM13_P8_S0	Mr. McGrath is independent as that term is defined under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.
1289496_12_ITEM14_P0_S0	Rose, Snyder, Jacobs, serves as our independent registered public accounting firm and audited our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM14_P1_S0	The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company s auditor and the fees to be paid in connection with such services in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor s independence.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P0_S0	The following documents are filed as a part of this report or incorporated herein by reference:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P1_S0	Our Consolidated Financial Statements are listed on page F-1 of this Annual Report.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P2_S0	The following documents are included as exhibits to this Annual Report:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P3_S0	In accordance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the registrant caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized on this 13th day of April, 2012.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P4_S0	In accordance with the Exchange Act, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P5_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cord Blood America, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P5_S1	Cord Blood America, Inc. s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P6_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1289496_12_ITEM15_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P6_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P6_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P6_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P7_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cord Blood America, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has sustained recurring operating losses, continues to consume cash in operating activities, and has insufficient working capital and an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P9_S2	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P9_S3	Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P9_S4	The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1289496_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	Cord Blood America, Inc. ("CBAI"), formerly D A Lending, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Florida on October 12, 1999.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P15_S1	In October, 2009, CBAI re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	CBAI is primarily a holding company whose subsidiaries include Cord Partners, Inc., CorCell Co. Inc., CorCell Ltd., ( Cord ), CBA Professional Services, Inc.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	D/B/A BodyCells, Inc. ("BodyCells"), CBA Properties, Inc. ("Properties"), and Career Channel Inc, D/B/A Rainmakers International ("Rain").
1289496_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	CBAI and its subsidiaries engage in the following business activities:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Cord specializes in providing private cord blood stem cell preservation services to families.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	Stellacure GmbH specializes in providing cord blood stem cell preservation services to families in Germany and Spain.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	Biocordcell Argentina S.A. specializes in providing cord blood stem cell preservation to families in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	BodyCells is a developmental stage company and intends to be in the business of collecting, processing and preserving peripheral blood and adipose tissue stem cells allowing individuals to privately preserve their stem cells for potential future use in stem cell therapy.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Properties were formed to hold the corporate trademarks and other intellectual property of CBAI.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Rain has specialized in creating direct response television and radio advertising campaigns, including media placement and commercial production.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	Management has reduced the activities of Rain, terminated its former employees, and in 2010 was no longer seeking business.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	This is consistent with management s decision to focus its attention exclusively on the stem cell storage business and related activities.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	The accompanying financial statements of Cord Blood America, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	CBAI has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $48.7 million as of December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	In addition, CBAI has consumed cash in its operating activities of approximately $1.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2011 and has a working capital deficit of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2011.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P26_S2	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Management has been able, thus far, to finance the losses and the growth of the business, through private placements of its common stock, the issuance of debt and proceeds from the Equity Distribution Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement, and expects to continue to raise funds through debt and equity instruments.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	CBAI is continuing to attempt to increase revenues within its core businesses and through acquiring other businesses in the stem cell industry.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	In addition, the Company has taken steps to reduce its overall spending through the reduction of our labor force.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P27_S3	The ongoing execution of CBAI's business plan is expected to result in operating losses over the next twelve months.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	There are no assurances that CBAI will be successful in achieving its goals of increasing revenues and reaching profitability.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	In view of these conditions, CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its financing requirements, and to ultimately achieve profitable operations.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBAI and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, Cord, Stellacure GmbH, Biocordcell Argentina S.A., BodyCells, Properties and Rain.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood, advertising, commercial production and internet lead generation.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	Accounts receivable relating to deferred revenues are netted against deferred revenues for presentation purposes.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	The allowance is reviewed periodically and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P31_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while major replacement and improvements are capitalized as additions to the related assets.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	Sales and disposals of assets are recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation from the related asset and accumulated depreciation accounts with any gain or loss credited or charged to income upon disposition.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships as part of the acquisition of the CorCell and CureSource assets in 2007 in addition to the acquisition of Biocordcell in 2010 (Note 3).
1289496_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	During 2011 the Company also foreclosed and acquired assets from NeoCells, a subsidiary of ViviCells, as satisfaction of outstanding receivables from Vivicells.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Intangible assets are stated at cost.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Amortization of intangible assets is computed using the sum of the years digits method, over an estimated useful life of 18 years.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows: 2012: $609,561; 2013: $576,447; 2014: $543,332; 2015: $510,219; 2016: $477,105.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P37_S3	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances are more likely than not to reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Cord has a non-controlling equity investment in ViviCells International, Inc., a privately held company in the business of providing cord blood stem cell and adult peripheral blood stem cell preservation services.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting as it owns more than 20% of the outstanding common stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over this company.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P38_S2	As such, the investment is carried at cost less Cord's proportionate share of ViviCells net loss for the period since investment.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P38_S3	At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of this investment was $0.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	During 2011 the Company foreclosed on and acquired all the assets of Neocells, a subsidiary of ViviCells, as satisfaction on the outstanding receivable from ViviCells.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	There is no remaining investment in ViviCells as of December 31, 2011 because of this action.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Cord has a minority equity investment in China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company, and a privately held company organized to conduct a stem cell storage business in China.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	In 2011, Cord acquired a minority equity investment in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company utilizes the cost method of accounting as it owns less than 20% of the outstanding common stock and only has the ability to exercise nominal, not signficant, influence over these companies.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	The cost of this investment was $0.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	At December 31, 2011 the cost of these investments were $30,098.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	"Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities"), requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and in accordance with ASC 815-40-15 (formerly EITF 00-19 "Accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock") to determine whether they should be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	At December 31, 201 1 , the Company adjusted its derivative liability to its fair value, and reflected the change in fair value, in its consolidated statement of operations.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables").
1289496_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Cord, Stellacure and Bio recognize revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	Franchise revenues which are part of Biocordcells current income are recognized in accordance with ASC 952-605-3, according to requirements for recognizing franchise revenues after franchise agreement services are completed and substantially performed.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Costs for Cord, Stellacure, and Bio are incurred as umbilical cord blood is collected.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	These costs include the transportation of the umbilical cord blood from the hospital to the lab, direct material plus labor costs for processing and cryogenic storage, and allocated rent, utility and general administrative expenses.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	In the case of Stellacure, similar expenses are incurred, but via an outsourced relationship for laboratory services.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company expenses costs in the period incurred.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that included the enactment date.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P50_S4	The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance based on the portion of tax benefits that more likely than not will not be realized.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	There was a valuation allowance equal to 100% of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 201 1 .
1289496_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company follows guidance issued by the FASB with regard to its accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Such guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taking authorities.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Interest and penalties totaled $0 for the years ended December 31, 201 1 and 20 10 .
1289496_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company files income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and various state jurisdictions.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	For jurisdictions in which tax filings are prepared, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by state tax authorities for years through 2006 and by the IRS for years through 2007.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company s share-based employee compensation plans are described in Note 10.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718 (previously SFAS 123(R), Accounting for Stock-based Compensation (Revised 2004) ( 123(R) ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants, including employee stock options.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Net loss per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding of 86,143,153 and 54,199,942 for the years ended December 31, 201 1 and 20 10 , respectively.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	Outstanding options to acquire common stock and warrants are not included in the computation of net loss per common share because the effects of inclusion are anti-dilutive.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Concentrations of credit risk (whether on or off balance sheet) that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions described below.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Relationships and agreements which could potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of the use of one source for the processing and storage of all umbilical cord blood and one source for the development and maintenance of a website.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company believes that alternative sources are available for each of these concentrations.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk could consist of cash balances maintained in excess of federal depository insurance limits.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high credit quality financial institutions.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	At times, cash and cash equivalent balances may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	To date, the Company has not experienced any such losses.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	Level inputs, as defined by ASC 820-10, are as follows:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Level 2 other significant observable inputs for the assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Level 3 significant unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
1289496_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 201 1 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	Derivatives liability was valued under the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 20 10 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Derivatives liability was valued under the Black-Scholes model, with the following assumptions:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the derivatives liability:
1289496_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenues, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and very useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove approximately one liter of bone marrow.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P31_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	According to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, over 45,000 bone marrow and other hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant procedures were performed worldwide in 2002.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	In the past decade, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and preservation of these cells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the blood stored.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	Stem cells have been successfully recovered from cord blood after at least twenty five years of storage in liquid nitrogen.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P36_S6	However, these cells may be able to retain their usefulness at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Cord s operations provide umbilical cord blood banking services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States and Puerto Rico.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Company s corporate headquarters re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA in October 2009.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Cord blood testing, processing, and some storage were conducted for a period of time through outsourced laboratory partners, Bergen Community Blood Services and Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC, (PCT).
1289496_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	In March 2010, Cord began to process and store cord blood in its own facility in Las Vegas.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least twenty five years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, primarily through organic growth.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	In March of 2010 the Company acquired pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non dilutable interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	In exchange for issuance of equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalties payable beginning in 2011.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	The Company invoiced $62,866 for its minimum royalty payment for 2011.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	The Company did not invoice China Stem Cells for the 2012 minimum royalty payment due of $187,136, since it has not been paid the 2011 royalty balance, and it remains doubtful that this balance will be repaid.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	In December of 2010 the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, provided a total of $400,000 in additional capital to Cayman, and is to receive Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 50 Cayman (TBD) Warrants.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Secured Convertible Promissory Notes are convertible into Cayman stock at a conversion price of $1,500 per share, subject to certain adjustments.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	In March 2010, the Company acquired 138,712 Series B Shares of Stellacure, GmbH, which represents an ownership percentage of 51%, a German Limited Liability Company that is in the business of privately collecting, processing, and storing cord blood samples.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	The purchase price paid by the Company was EUR 501,000.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Stellacure operates primarily in Germany; however, it established sales channels in Spain and Italy in 2009.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	On September 28, 2012, the Company sold its 51% ownership interest in Stellacure of Hamburg, Germany to Medivision mbH.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	In line with the Company s strategy to focus on its cash producing operations in the US and Argentina, the sale included consideration of approximately $43,000 in a loan repayment, approximately $69,000 forgiveness of a remaining loan balance owed to Stellacure from Company, and a waiver against all past and future claims.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 644,888 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	The plan was scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P55_S4	However, Vivi subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	On April 13, 2011, the Company filed a Non Consummation of Confirmed Plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	The Company pursued its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all assets of NeoCells, ViviCells subsidiary.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	Then, on April 22, 2011, ViviCells filed an adversary proceeding against the Company, in the same United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana), where ViviCells bankruptcy proceedings had been taking place (the Adversary Proceeding ).
1289496_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	ViviCells followed this by, in the Adversary Proceeding, filing a Motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2011, seeking to halt the foreclosure by the Company on the assets of NeoCells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	The complaint and the motion were amended on May 2, 2011, primarily by adding NeoCells, in addition to ViviCells, as a party to the adversary proceeding and the motion.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	The motion was heard on May 2, 2011.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	The motion was denied, and accordingly, the Company proceeded on May 2, 2011 at 1:00 pm (CST) to foreclose against all assets of NeoCells.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	At the public disposition of all property owned by NeoCells, the Company as a secured creditor bid $320,000 in offset debt, and acquired all right, title and interest in said property free and clear of any liens, security interests and encumbrances which are junior and subordinate to the Company s security interest as a secured creditor.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	The tangible property acquired that the Company desired to retain was relocated to the Company s Las Vegas facility.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	On June 2, 2011, the Court entered an order dismissing the Adversary Proceeding, and on July 11, 2011, the Court entered an Order Closing Adversary Proceeding.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.1% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).
1289496_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Under the Agreement, the Company paid $375,000 in cash at the closing, and was obligated to pay an additional $350,000 in October, 2010, $150,000 of which is part of the fixed portion of the purchase price for the shares, for a total minimum purchase price of $525,000.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	The remaining $200,000 of this payment represents advances against the contingent payments due based on Bio s 2010 and 2011 net income performances.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	The Agreement provides that the Shareholders are to be paid contingent earn-out compensation in 2011 based on achieving certain levels of net income in 2010 of which the Shareholders were paid $500,000.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	As of June 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with the shareholders of Bio from whom the Company purchased its majority ownership interest in Bio in 2010 (the "Sellers") relating to the 2011 earnout.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	U nder the Agreement, the Company will pay the Sellers the following: $25,000 on or before June 30, 2012; $10,000 on or before July 31, 2012; and $25,000 on or before September 30, 2012, for a total cash payment of $60,000.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	In addition, the Sellers will collect the Company s portion of BioCells shareholder dividends for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, up to a maximum amount of $440,000, if any.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P62_S4	Also, if BioCells is sold before April 2014 and certain thresholds for purchase price and payment are met or exceeded, then the Sellers could receive additional compensation, specifically an amount which equals $705,000 minus any amounts paid pursuant to the cash payments and payments from the Company s shareholder dividends, which are detailed above.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P62_S5	That sum would be paid to the Sellers out of the proceeds of such a sale.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that are incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P63_S3	The second tranche provides the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_13_ITEM1_P63_S4	The Company loaned $153,092 (US) to VidaPlus during the year ended December 31, 2011 and $93,396 during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 in connection with the second tranche of this agreement.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P63_S5	Converting the investment from a loan into equity for tranche two will take place within 24 months, and the obligation will have been met in full after 1,000 samples have been processed and stored.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	The third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).

1289496_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	On January 19, 2012, the Company notified VidaPlus 2007, S.L. that effective January 24, 2012 it was exercising its right under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed January 24, 2011, Tranche 1, to convert its loan into 6% of the outstanding shares such that the Company will own a total of 7% of the outstanding shares.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in Vidaplus over the money invested by the Company in Vidaplus.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under Tranche 2.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	CBAI holds a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	CBAI holds that pledge until such time as it converts the monies paid to Vidaplus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement with Vidaplus into equity into Vidaplus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	CBAI must make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which means that such conversion shall take place around or before February 2014.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	CBAI also holds a liquidation preference in Vidaplus for the money the Company invested in Vidaplus.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company holds 7% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Company wrote-down the book value of the equity to $0 as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	The Company also wrote-down the convertible loan receivable to $123,263 as of December 31, 2012.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P70_S2	In March 2011, the assets acquired were relocated to the Company s Las Vegas laboratory.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Company has built its business in the United States ( US ) via a model of organic growth and accretive acquisitions.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Management believes that in the US the organic differentiator for the company is its emphasis on strategic relationships with larger health insurance providers.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	This approach differs from its major competitors who tend to focus on a traditional pharmaceutical model by having sales representatives cover a geographical market by visiting ob/gyn practices.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	By focusing on the health insurance relationships, while the sales cycle is longer, once established, management believes the sales approach builds loyalty and recurring sales.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Company officially opened its own laboratory operations at its new facility in Las Vegas, Nevada in March, 2010.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Previously the Company has outsourced these key scientific elements to a third party.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	Now, with this key expertise in house, the Company has the ability to continue making advancements on existing and new services related to stem cells as well as better manage laboratory costs related to processing and storage.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Company at the present does not engage in clinical research and development activities at its laboratory facility.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Management may add acquisitions that increase the recurring storage based revenues, assuming cost effective new sources of capital can be located to make such accretive acquisitions.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	To date, the Company has concluded seven acquisitions, and management believes multiple opportunities may exist in the future to acquire smaller competitors who do not have the financial resources to compete on a go forward basis.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Patents, Trademarks, Licenses or Royalty Agreements.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	PharmaStem Therapeutics holds certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of our competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners may, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem technology and processes covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P79_S4	All of the patents expired in 2010.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	Other than royalties, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	As of 2008, Cord has ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P80_S4	The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P80_S5	As of December 2012, the Company included approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 included in accrued expenses to account for this liability since 2008.

1289496_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	CBAI also from time to time relies on a variety of intellectual property rights that the Company licenses from third parties.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	Although the Company believes that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licensed intellectual property, these third party properties and technologies may not continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	The steps the Company has taken to protect its copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property.
1289496_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	If this were to occur, it could harm its reputation and adversely affect its competitive position or results of operations.

1289496_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Since inception, the Company has primarily financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	However, over the past three quarters of 2012, the Company has reduced operating expenses, ended investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, including the sale of its 51% ownership in Stellacure GmbH, and received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its products, the Company could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company believes that the key to its success is to increase sales of its cord blood preservation services and thereby increase its revenues and available cash.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	CBAI s success with regard to cord blood preservation services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-preservation of cord blood and its efforts to educate potential customers and sell its services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Broad use and acceptance of the Company s service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	CBAI may not have the resources required to promote its services and their potential benefits.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Continued commercialization of the Company services will also require that it satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of its services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for its services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If CBAI is unable to increase market acceptance of its services, the Company may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to maintain profitability or to continue its operation.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The DTC Previously Effectuated a Chill On The Company s Stock, Since Removed, The Results Of Which Have An Adverse Impact On The Cost To The Company Of Utilizing Existing Capital Sources.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In December, 2010, the DTC unilaterally and without consultation with the Company chilled all newly issued shares of the Company s common stock which were entitled to be freely traded in the market and whose holders expected to utilize the DTC Electronic Trading System.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Under what the DTC calls a chill, the DTC precludes shares which it has unilaterally chilled from utilizing its Electronic Stock Transfer System, thereby putting the holders of such chilled shares at a disadvantage in the trading market when they go to sell their shares.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a result of the chill, existing sources of funding for the Company became more costly.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Namely, the Company was forced to negotiate a settlement agreement with investor Tangiers Capital, LLC ( Tangiers ) to settle an alleged breach of contract as a result of this DTC chill.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Specifically: on January 19, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement and liquidated damages agreement (the Agreement ) with Tangiers.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Execution of the Agreement became necessary because under the existing agreement with Tangiers, entered June 27, 2008, the Company was obligated to deliver registered shares which could be immediately placed into the Automated System for Deposits and withdrawals of Securities (known as DWAC ).
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Agreement provided that as Liquidated Damages, the Company will remit a specified sum (the Penalty Sum ) to Tangiers on each share the investor has previously purchased and currently holds, and on each share purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future, until such time as the shares held by Tangiers can again be deposited into the DWAC system.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Company currently owes no damages for shares purchased by Tangiers in the past.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As to potential future damages, shares can only be purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future at the Company s election, as the June 27, 2008 agreement works in a manner similar to a credit line.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Thus, it is possible no such damages will become due.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In the event the Company elects to allow Tangiers to purchase shares for cash in the future, Tangiers may argue that a Penalty Sum may be due from the Company to Tangiers, even though the DTC chill has been removed, because the Company is not eligible for the DTC s FAST program, including DWAC, which would thereby make this capital source more costly to the Company.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Tangiers Notes have been retired in full as set forth in Note 16.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The Company was forced to enter into the February 8, 2011 settlement agreement with JMJ Financial ( JMJ ) due to the chill for the same or similar reasons the Company was forced to enter the above described settlement agreement with Tangiers, which resulted in $671,385 as monetary damages.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Company will not incur additional monetary damages to JMJ under that settlement agreement, however, under the settlement agreement, the discount rate on JMJ s conversions of the notes governed by the settlement agreement was changed in JMJ s favor, and in addition, the settlement agreement added a prepayment penalty for any previously funded portions of any JMJ note and added a cancellation fee for any portion of any past or future JMJ note which has not yet been funded.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The JMJ Notes have been retired in full as set forth more fully in Item 1.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	under Events 2012, in this filing.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	St. George Investments, LLC was not a capital source for the Company prior to the DTC effectuating the chill, and as such, is described more fully in Note 9.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Tonaquint, Inc. was not a capital source for the Company prior to the DTC effectuating the chill, and as such, is described more fully in Note 9.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Though the chill described herein has been removed by the DTC, it remains possible the DTC could again institute a chill, which could result in sources of funding for the Company becoming more costly, to the extent such funding existed or was desired by the Company at any such point in time that a chill was effectuated.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If It Provides Poor Service, If Its Services Do Not Comply With Its Agreements Or If Its Storage Facilities Fail.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Company must meet its customers service level expectations and its contractual obligations with respect to its services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Failure to do so could subject the Company to liability, as well as cause it to lose customers.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In some cases, the Company relies upon third party contractors to assist in providing its services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	CBAI s ability to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of its third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Any material disruption in the Company's ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Company systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Company may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate us for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If The Company Does Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, It May Not Be Able To Market Its Cord Blood Banking Services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The cord blood banking services that the Company provides are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The cord blood facility the Company operates has registered with the FDA as a cord blood banking service, listed its products with the FDA, and will be subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, the FDA has proposed new good tissue practice regulations that would establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as proposed rules for donor suitability.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Consistent with industry practice, the Company s cord blood collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The FDA has announced that it will implement more regulatory procedures for cord blood banking in 2006.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	This new regulation may require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval for the collection kits.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Securing any necessary medical device clearance or approval for the cord blood collection kits may involve the submission of a substantial volume of data and may require a lengthy substantive review.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	This would increase costs and could reduce profitability.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The FDA could also require that we cease using the collection kit and require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval prior to further use of the kits.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	This could cause us to cease operations for some period of time.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Of the states in which the Company provides cord blood banking services, only California, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	CBAI maintains the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York and New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood banking services, the Company may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Because The Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, The Company s Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Its Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services the Company provides.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for the Company's services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	CBAI believes that its future success will depend largely on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of its customers.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Expectant parents may not use Company services and its services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	And, In The Event Its Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Its Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Cord blood banking and stem cell preservation is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Company business faces competition from other operators of cord blood and stem cell preservation businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter Company markets and compete with CBAI for increased market share.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Many competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than Company currently has.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	The Company does not have any research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such R D. Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than the Company, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than the Company currently attracts.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on CBAI revenues and profitability.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	In the event that the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for CBAI to grow its revenue and maintain its existing business.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm CBAI.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	CBAI depends on its ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If Company information systems fail to perform as expected, or if the Company suffers an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	And Stability Of The General Economy.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as the current recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on our services.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In The Financial Market May Negatively Impact The Company s Ability To Access The Credit Markets.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors while the Company currently requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Its Operations.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	CBAI s success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of its President Chairman Joseph Vicente and Vice President and General Counsel Stephen Morgan.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The loss of either s services could materially harm the Company s business because of the cost and time necessary to find their successor.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	CBAI does not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on either Executive Officer.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company also has other key employees who manage its operations and if the Company were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	To the extent that the Company is smaller than its competitors and has fewer resources, the Company may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Trading Of The Company Stock May Be Restricted By The Securities Exchange Commission s Penny Stock Regulations, Which May Limit A Stockholder s Ability To Buy And Sell The Company Stock.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	CBAI securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade Company securities.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P43_S6	The Company believes that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Failure To Establish And Maintain Effective Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Could Have An Adverse Effect On The Company s Business, Operating Results and Stock Price.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If CBAI is unable to maintain adequate internal controls, its business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	In October, 2009, the Company re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company s new principal office and laboratory operations are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	This facility encompasses approximately 17,000 square feet.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The property is leased from an unaffiliated third party for a period of five years ending September 2014.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	The monthly lease payments are approximately $15,303, which includes Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S5	The lease on the property in Santa Monica, California expired on September 30, 2012 and was not renewed.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P0_S6	The Company has no further obligation on the Santa Monica lease.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company maintains fire and casualty insurance on its leased property in an amount deemed adequate by management.
1289496_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Argentina subsidiary leases a facility for operations in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	On or around September 21, 2011, Lindsay Bays, et.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	al filed a case against the Company, along with additional defendants Corcell, Inc., Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC, and Bergen Community Blood Center in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, case number 11-C-1664, alleging claims of breach of contract, negligence, and other related claims.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	After the filing, the case was removed by the defendants to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, where it was Civil Action No. 2:11-0939.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Plaintiff alleges that she entered into a contract for the collection and storage of her child s cord blood.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	She claims that though her child was accepted as a candidate for autoreinfusion treatment of her child s cerebral palsy in the Duke University Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, her child was unable to participate, purportedly due to the defendants actions in labeling and shipping the blood.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	She sought monetary damages for injuries losses, and other special and general damages, punitive damages, interest and attorneys fees.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	On or around December 5, 2011, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the action.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	Defendants Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC and Bergen Community Blood Center also filed motions to dismiss.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	On or around May 8, 2012, the Court denied the Company s Motion to Dismiss, without prejudice, and further ordered that the Plaintiffs be given leave until July 16, 2012 to conduct jurisdictional discovery regarding the Company s and CorCell s contacts with the state of West Virginia and granting the Company leave to, by motion, renew its challenge to personal jurisdiction no later than July 23, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Court granted motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by defendants Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC and Bergen Community Blood Center.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	On July 18, 2012, Plaintiff and the Company filed a Stipulation of Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 41(A), dismissing the case against Cord Blood America, Inc., without prejudice.
1289496_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	In the event Plaintiff files another case involving these circumstances, the Company will continue to vigorously defend against the claims.

1289496_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The decrease in the total assets is related to the reserve recorded on the related party receivables from China Stem Cells, Ltd and Vidaplus and the impairment recorded on the Vidaplus equity investment along with the deconsolidation of Stellacure.
1289496_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	The total liabilities at December 31, 2012 were $5.84 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue $1.80 million, $0.54 million and $2.34 million respectively.

1289496_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.

1289496_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s management, including its president and chief financial officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that its disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including its president, vice president, and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The deficiency in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Company assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P10_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P10_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P11_S0	The deficiency in the Company's internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_13_ITEM9A_P11_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.

1289496_13_ITEM11_P1_S1	Currently, the Company does not have a compensation committee, and as such, the Board of Directors is responsible for determining the compensation of the Company s named executive officers.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P2_S0	The primary goals of the Company policy of executive compensation are to attract and retain the most talented and dedicated executives possible, to assure that its executives are compensated effectively in a manner consistent with Company strategy and competitive practice, and to align executive s compensation with the achievement of the Company s short and long term business objectives.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P3_S0	The Board of Directors considers a variety of factors in determining compensation of executives, including their particular background and circumstances, such as their training and prior relevant work experience, their success in attracting and retaining savvy and technically proficient managers and employees, increasing its revenues, broadening the Company product line offerings, managing costs and otherwise helping to lead the Company through a period of profitable growth.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P4_S0	In the future, the Company expects that the Board of Directors will form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs of the Company and with the full authority to determine and approve the compensation of the Company s President and Vice President and make recommendations with respect to the compensation of other executive officers.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P4_S1	CBAI expects that its compensation committee will continue to follow the general approach to executive compensation that we have followed to date, rewarding superior individual and company performance with commensurate cash compensation.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Company s compensation program for the named executive officers consists primarily of base salary.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P5_S1	There is no retirement plan, long-term incentive plan or other such plans, although Mr. Vicente s and Mr. Morgan s agreements have a bonus plan, subject to the Board s discretion.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P6_S0	The base salary provided is intended to equitably compensate the named executive officers based upon their level of responsibility, complexity and importance of role, leadership and growth potential, and experience.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Company s named executive officers receive base salaries commensurate with their roles and responsibilities, while considering the financial condition of the Company.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P7_S1	Base salaries and subsequent adjustments, if any, are reviewed and approved by the Company s Board of Directors annually, based on an informal review of relevant market data and each executive s performance for the prior year, as well as each executive s experience, expertise and position.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P7_S2	The base salaries paid to the Company s named executive officers in 2012 are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Company previously provided equity awards as a component of compensation.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P8_S1	No such awards were provided in 2012, but the Company retains the position of providing such compensation considering a host of performance based criteria that will encourage executives to remain employed by the Company and also to attract persons of exceptional ability to become executives of the Company.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P9_S0	On September 12, 2011 (the Company ), entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Joseph R. Vicente, then the Company s Chief Operating Officer and Vice President and appointed Chairman and President on May 15, 2012 by the Board of Directors, which was effective as of August 1, 2011 and shall terminate as of December 31, 2014, unless earlier terminated by the Company or Mr. Vicente.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P9_S1	Mr. Vicente s Executive Employment Contract has an initial term from August 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, and is renewable annually thereafter for up to three additional, successive years, and provides for a base salary equal to his previous year s annual salary, which said salary was set under the provisions of the previous employment agreement entered between Mr. Vicente and the Company in July of 2008.

1289496_13_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Agreement provides for a change of control termination bonus, whereby if the Employee is terminated, his compensation reduced, or the Company terminates the Employee s employment within one year after a change in control, then the Employee is entitled to a termination benefit in an amount equal to the employee s cash compensation over the one (1) year preceding the Triggering Event (defined in the Agreement).
1289496_13_ITEM11_P10_S2	The Agreement also provides for termination payments in the absence of a change of control in the event the Company terminates the Employee without cause in an amount equal to all compensation paid by the Company to the Employee for the 12 months preceding the termination, along with health plan and 401k incentives (if any were to be offered the Company terminated its 401k earlier in 2012), as stated in the Agreement.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Agreement provides for an annual salary of $125,000, along with a bonus, payable at the discretion of the Board of Directors of up to an annual amount of 20% of the Employee s salary.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P11_S1	Mr. Morgan s compensation, as set forth in the Agreement has not increased as a result of his election to the officer positions of Vice President and Secretary on May 15, 2012 in addition to his retention of his previous position, General Counsel.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P12_S0	The Company believes the assumption of additional roles by existing management and other individuals in leadership positions, including filling recently vacated roles, will reduce overall management costs while also leading to greater efficiency within the organization.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P13_S0	Based on criteria for the 6-month period between February 23, 2012 and August 23, 2012, Mr. Morgan was due $12,500 as bonus compensation to be paid on or around August 23rd.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P13_S1	Mr. Morgan declined that compensation, citing the Company s goals, as set forth in recent press releases, and accordingly the Company did not make that payment to Mr. Morgan.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P14_S0	The Company adopted a tax-qualified employee savings and retirement plan, the 401(k) Plan, for eligible U.S. employees, including named executive officers.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P14_S1	Eligible employees may elect to defer a percentage of their eligible compensation in the 401(k) Plan, subject to the statutorily prescribed annual limit.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P14_S2	After 1000 hours of service, the Company matches dollar for dollar up to 3% of compensation, and then $0.50 per dollar up to 5% of compensation, for a maximum cumulative match of 4%.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P15_S0	All contributions made by tax qualified employees are fully vested.
1289496_13_ITEM11_P15_S1	The Company intends the 401(k) Plan, and the accompanying trust, to qualify under Sections 401(k) and 501 of the Internal Revenue Code so that contributions by employees to the 401(k) Plan, and income earned (if any) on plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) Plan, and so that we will be able to deduct our contributions, if any, when made.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P12_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P12_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P12_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cord Blood America, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	The accompanying financial statements of Cord Blood America, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	CBAI has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $51.2 million as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	In addition, CBAI has notes and loans payable of approximately $2.23 million as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P31_S2	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Since inception, the Company has financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	Over the past three quarters, the Company has reduced operating expenses, ended investment in its unconsolidated affiliates and received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P32_S3	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P32_S4	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P32_S5	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P32_S6	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products, we could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	In view of these conditions, CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its financing requirements, and to ultimately achieve profitable operations.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Amortization of intangible assets is computed using the sum of the years digits method, over an estimated useful life of 18 years.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P42_S2	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P42_S3	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances are more likely than not to reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Cord has a non-controlling equity investment in ViviCells International, Inc., a privately held company in the business of providing cord blood stem cell and adult peripheral blood stem cell preservation services.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P56_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that included the enactment date.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P56_S4	The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance based on the portion of tax benefits that more likely than not will not be realized.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P56_S5	There was a valuation allowance equal to 100% of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company follows guidance issued by the FASB with regard to its accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	Such guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taking authorities.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	Interest and penalties totaled $0 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

1289496_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	Outstanding options to acquire common stock and warrants are not included in the computation of net loss per common share because the effects of inclusion are anti-dilutive.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	Concentrations of credit risk (whether on or off balance sheet) that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions described below.
1289496_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	Relationships and agreements which could potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of the use of one source for the processing and storage of all umbilical cord blood and one source for the development and maintenance of a website.

1289496_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and very useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove approximately one liter of bone marrow.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	According to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, over 45,000 bone marrow and other hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant procedures were performed worldwide in 2002.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	In the past decade, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and preservation of these cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the blood stored.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S5	Stem cells have been successfully recovered from cord blood after at least twenty five years of storage in liquid nitrogen.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P30_S6	However, these cells may be able to retain their usefulness at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Cord s operations provide umbilical cord blood banking and cord tissue services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States and Puerto Rico.

1289496_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood and cord tissue unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least twenty five years when stored in this manner and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, primarily through organic growth.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	In March of 2010 the Company acquired pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non dilutable interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	In exchange for issuance of equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalties payable beginning in 2011.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	The Company has not been paid any royalty balance due to date, and it remains doubtful that any such royalties will be collected.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	In December of 2010 the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2012, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, provided a total of $400,000 in additional capital to Cayman, and is to receive Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 50 Cayman (TBD) Warrants.

1289496_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	In March 2010, the Company acquired 138,712 Series B Shares of Stellacure, GmbH, which represents an ownership percentage of 51%, a German Limited Liability Company that is in the business of privately collecting, processing, and storing cord blood samples.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The purchase price paid by the Company was EUR 501,000.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Stellacure operates primarily in Germany; however, it established sales channels in Spain and Italy in 2009.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	On September 28, 2012, the Company sold its 51% ownership interest in Stellacure of Hamburg, Germany to Medivision mbH.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	In line with the Company s strategy to focus on its cash producing operations in the US and Argentina, the sale included consideration of approximately $43,000 in a loan repayment, approximately $69,000 forgiveness of a remaining loan balance owed to Stellacure from Company, and a waiver against all past and future claims.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 644,888 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	The plan was scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P48_S4	However, Vivi subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	On April 13, 2011, the Company filed a Non Consummation of Confirmed Plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Company pursued its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all assets of NeoCells, ViviCells subsidiary.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Then, on April 22, 2011, ViviCells filed an adversary proceeding against the Company, in the same United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana), where ViviCells bankruptcy proceedings had been taking place (the Adversary Proceeding ).
1289496_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	ViviCells followed this by, in the Adversary Proceeding, filing a Motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2011, seeking to halt the foreclosure by the Company on the assets of NeoCells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	The complaint and the motion were amended on May 2, 2011, primarily by adding NeoCells, in addition to ViviCells, as a party to the adversary proceeding and the motion.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	The motion was heard on May 2, 2011.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	The motion was denied, and accordingly, the Company proceeded on May 2, 2011 at 1:00 pm (CST) to foreclose against all assets of NeoCells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	At the public disposition of all property owned by NeoCells, the Company as a secured creditor bid $320,000 in offset debt, and acquired all right, title and interest in said property free and clear of any liens, security interests and encumbrances which are junior and subordinate to the Company s security interest as a secured creditor.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	The tangible property acquired that the Company desired to retain was relocated to the Company s Las Vegas facility.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	On June 2, 2011, the Court entered an order dismissing the Adversary Proceeding, and on July 11, 2011, the Court entered an Order Closing Adversary Proceeding.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.1% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).
1289496_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Under the Agreement, the Company paid $375,000 in cash at the closing, and was obligated to pay an additional $350,000 in October, 2010, $150,000 of which is part of the fixed portion of the purchase price for the shares, for a total minimum purchase price of $525,000.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	The remaining $200,000 of this payment represents advances against the contingent payments due based on Bio s 2010 and 2011 net income performances.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Agreement provides that the Shareholders are to be paid contingent earn-out compensation in 2011 based on achieving certain levels of net income in 2010 of which the Shareholders were paid $500,000.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	As of June 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with the shareholders of Bio from whom the Company purchased its majority ownership interest in Bio in 2010 (the "Sellers") relating to the 2011 earnout.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	U nder the Agreement, the Company will pay the Sellers the following: $25,000 on or before June 30, 2012; $10,000 on or before July 31, 2012; and $25,000 on or before September 30, 2012, for a total cash payment of $60,000.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	In addition, the Sellers will collect the Company s portion of BioCells shareholder dividends for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, up to a maximum amount of $440,000, if any.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P55_S4	Also, if BioCells is sold before April 2014 and certain thresholds for purchase price and payment are met or exceeded, then the Sellers could receive additional compensation, specifically an amount which equals $705,000 minus any amounts paid pursuant to the cash payments and payments from the Company s shareholder dividends, which are detailed above.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P55_S5	That sum would be paid to the Sellers out of the proceeds of such a sale.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that are incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	The second tranche provides the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	The Company loaned $153,092 (US) to VidaPlus during the year ended December 31, 2011 and $93,396 during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 in connection with the second tranche of this agreement.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	Converting the investment from a loan into equity for tranche two will take place within 24 months, and the obligation will have been met in full after 1,000 samples have been processed and stored.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	The third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	VidaPlus contracts through Stellacure and their relationship with the German Red Cross for their processing and storage.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company is obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	On January 19, 2012, the Company notified VidaPlus 2007, S.L. that effective January 24, 2012 it was exercising its right under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed January 24, 2011, Tranche 1, to convert its loan into 6% of the outstanding shares such that the Company will own a total of 7% of the outstanding shares.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in Vidaplus over the money invested by the Company in Vidaplus.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under Tranche 2.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	CBAI holds a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	CBAI holds that pledge until such time as it converts the monies paid to Vidaplus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement with Vidaplus into equity into Vidaplus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	CBAI must make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which means that such conversion shall take place around or before February 2014.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	CBAI also holds a liquidation preference in Vidaplus for the money the Company invested in Vidaplus.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P61_S4	On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus as described more fully in Note 17.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company holds 7% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Company wrote-down the book value of the equity to $0 as of December 31, 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	The Company also wrote-down the convertible loan receivable from $123,263 to $0 as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	On February 24, 2011, the Company acquired the following assets; 593 umbilical cord blood samples and all related file documents, four (4) cryogenic storage tanks, and two computers from Reproductive Genetics Institute, Inc. (RGI) for $76,000 in cash.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Company paid an additional $48,885 to RGI to cover claims related to ViviCells International for a total $124,885.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	In March 2011, the assets acquired were relocated to the Company s Las Vegas laboratory.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Company is one of an estimated thirty (30) firms in the US providing private cord blood banking services, with approximately one half of those providing cord tissue related services.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	Internationally there are an estimated one hundred and twenty (120) additional firms offering these services.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Company has built its business in the United States ( US ) via a model of organic growth and accretive acquisitions.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Management believes that in the US an organic differentiator for the company is its emphasis on strategic relationships with larger health insurance providers.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	This approach differs from its major competitors who tend to focus on a traditional pharmaceutical model by having sales representatives cover a geographical market by visiting ob/gyn practices.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	By focusing on the health insurance relationships, while the sales cycle is longer, once established, management believes the sales approach builds loyalty and recurring sales.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P66_S3	The Company also in parallel is increasing its marketing efforts direct to the consumer via its digital presence.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P66_S4	Management believes as the industry matures, and parents become increasingly educated on stem cell banking, more decisions will be made directly between the parents and the Company.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Company officially opened its own laboratory operations at its new facility in Las Vegas, Nevada in March, 2010.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	Previously the Company has outsourced these key scientific elements to a third party and was primarily a reseller of cord blood services.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	Now, with this key expertise in house, the Company has the ability to continue making advancements on existing and new services related to stem cells as well as better manage laboratory costs and vendor relationships related to processing and storage.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	The Company at the present does not engage in clinical research and development activities at its laboratory facility, but continues to evaluate the advancing science for opportunities that may exist in the future.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Management may add acquisitions that increase the recurring storage based revenues, assuming cost effective new sources of capital can be located to make such accretive acquisitions.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	To date, the Company has concluded seven acquisitions, and management believes multiple opportunities may exist in the future to acquire smaller competitors who do not have the financial resources or a large enough recurring revenue base from storage to compete on a go forward basis.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Patents, Trademarks, Licenses or Royalty Agreements.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	PharmaStem Therapeutics claims to hold certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	In the past several years, PharmaStem has commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of our competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners could, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem s claimed technology and processes allegedly covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S4	Most of the patents at issue expired in 2010.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S5	PharmaStem could claim, arguendo , Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S6	Other than, potentially royalties, which would be disputed by Cord, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S7	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S8	As of 2008, Cord ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S9	The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P71_S10	As of December 31, 2013, the Company included approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 included in accrued expenses to account for this liability since 2008, though the Company disputes that it owes any royalties to Pharmastem.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Company relies upon a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in its business.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	The Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, vendors and others.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	The Company also seeks to control access to and distribution of its technology, documentation and other proprietary information.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Company uses numerous trademarks, trade names and service marks for its products and services.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	CBAI also from time to time relies on a variety of intellectual property rights that the Company licenses from third parties.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	Although the Company believes that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licensed intellectual property, these third party properties and technologies may not continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	The steps the Company has taken to protect its copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	If this were to occur, it could harm its reputation and adversely affect its competitive position or results of operations.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Company and CBA Properties, Inc. own various trademarks utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries.

1289496_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Company does not currently have any material capital expenditure commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of its properties.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	The Company does not believe compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, potential earnings or competitive position.

1289496_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Information on the operations of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1289496_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	The information provided on the Company s website is not part of this report and is not incorporated herein by reference.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The accompanying financial statements of Cord Blood America, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	CBAI has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $53.26 million as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, CBAI has produced cash in its operating activities of approximately $0.49 million for the year ending December 31, 2013 and has notes and loans payable of approximately $1.44 million at year end 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Since inception, the Company has primarily financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	However, over the past seven quarters, the Company has reduced operating expenses, ended investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, including the sale of its 51% ownership in Stellacure GmbH, and received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its products, the Company could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company believes that the key to its success is to increase sales of its cord blood and cord tissue preservation services and thereby increase its revenues and available cash.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	CBAI s success with regard to cord blood and cord tissue preservation services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-preservation of cord blood and tissue, and its efforts to educate potential customers and sell its services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Broad use and acceptance of the Company s service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	CBAI may not have the resources required to promote its services and their potential benefits.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Continued commercialization of the Company services will also require that it satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of its services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for its services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If CBAI is unable to increase market acceptance of its services, the Company may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to maintain profitability or to continue its operation.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The DTC Previously Effectuated a Chill On The Company s Stock, Since Removed, The Results Of Which Have An Adverse Impact On The Cost To The Company Of Utilizing Existing Capital Sources.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In December, 2010, the DTC unilaterally and without consultation with the Company chilled all newly issued shares of the Company s common stock which were entitled to be freely traded in the market and whose holders expected to utilize the DTC Electronic Trading System.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Under what the DTC calls a chill, the DTC precludes shares which it has unilaterally chilled from utilizing its Electronic Stock Transfer System, thereby putting the holders of such chilled shares at a disadvantage in the trading market when they go to sell their shares.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a result of the chill, existing sources of funding for the Company became more costly.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Namely, the Company was forced to negotiate a settlement agreement with investor Tangiers Capital, LLC ( Tangiers ) to settle an alleged breach of contract as a result of this DTC chill.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Specifically: on January 19, 2011, the Company entered into a settlement and liquidated damages agreement (the Agreement ) with Tangiers.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Execution of the Agreement became necessary because under the existing agreement with Tangiers, entered June 27, 2008, the Company was obligated to deliver registered shares which could be immediately placed into the Automated System for Deposits and withdrawals of Securities (known as DWAC ).
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Agreement provided that as Liquidated Damages, the Company will remit a specified sum (the Penalty Sum ) to Tangiers on each share the investor has previously purchased and currently holds, and on each share purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future, until such time as the shares held by Tangiers can again be deposited into the DWAC system.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Company currently owes no damages for shares purchased by Tangiers in the past.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As to potential future damages, shares can only be purchased by Tangiers for cash in the future at the Company s election, as the June 27, 2008 agreement works in a manner similar to a credit line.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Thus, it is possible no such damages will become due.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In the event the Company elects to allow Tangiers to purchase shares for cash in the future, Tangiers may argue that a Penalty Sum may be due from the Company to Tangiers, even though the DTC chill has been removed, because the Company is not eligible for the DTC s FAST program, including DWAC, which would thereby make this capital source more costly to the Company.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The Tangiers Notes have been retired in full as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company was forced to enter into the February 8, 2011 settlement agreement with JMJ Financial ( JMJ ) due to the chill for the same or similar reasons the Company was forced to enter the above described settlement agreement with Tangiers, which resulted in $671,385 as monetary damages.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company did not incur additional monetary damages to JMJ under that settlement agreement, however, under the settlement agreement, the discount rate on JMJ s conversions of the notes governed by the settlement agreement was changed in JMJ s favor, and in addition, the settlement agreement added a prepayment penalty for any previously funded portions of any JMJ note and added a cancellation fee for any portion of any past or future JMJ note which has not yet been funded.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The JMJ Notes have been retired in full.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	St. George Investments, LLC was not a capital source for the Company prior to the DTC effectuating the chill, and as such, is described more fully in Note 9.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Tonaquint, Inc. was not a capital source for the Company prior to the DTC effectuating the chill, and as such, is described more fully in Note 9.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Though the chill described herein has been removed by the DTC, it remains possible the DTC could again institute a chill, which could result in sources of funding for the Company becoming more costly, to the extent such funding existed or was desired by the Company at any such point in time that a chill was effectuated.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If It Provides Poor Service, If Its Services Do Not Comply With Its Agreements Or If Its Storage Facilities Fail.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The Company must meet its customers service level expectations and its contractual obligations with respect to its services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Failure to do so could subject the Company to liability, as well as cause it to lose customers.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In some cases, the Company relies upon third party contractors to assist in providing its services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	CBAI s ability to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of its third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Any material disruption in the Company's ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The Company may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate us for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If The Company Does Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, It May Not Be Able To Market Its Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking Services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The cord blood banking services that the Company provides are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The cord blood facility the Company operates has registered with the FDA as a cord blood banking service, listed its products with the FDA, and will be subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the FDA has proposed new good tissue practice regulations that would establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as proposed rules for donor suitability.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Consistent with industry practice, the Company s cord blood collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The FDA has announced that it will implement more regulatory procedures for cord blood banking in 2006.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	This new regulation may require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval for the collection kits.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Securing any necessary medical device clearance or approval for the cord blood collection kits may involve the submission of a substantial volume of data and may require a lengthy substantive review.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	This would increase costs and could reduce profitability.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The FDA could also require that we cease using the collection kit and require medical device pre-market notification clearance or approval prior to further use of the kits.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	This could cause us to cease operations for some period of time.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Company may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Of the states in which the Company provides cord blood banking services, only California, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	CBAI maintains the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York and New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood and cord tissue banking services, the Company may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Because The Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, The Company s Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Its Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services the Company provides.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for the Company's services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	CBAI believes that its future success will depend largely on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of its customers.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Expectant parents may not use Company services and its services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	And, In The Event Its Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Its Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Cord blood and cord tissue banking and stem cell preservation is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Company business faces competition from other operators of cord blood cord tissue and cord tissue stem cell preservation businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter Company markets and compete with CBAI for increased market share.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Many competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than Company currently has.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	The Company does not have any research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such R D. Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than the Company, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than the Company currently attracts.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S5	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on CBAI revenues and profitability.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P28_S6	In the event that the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for CBAI to grow its revenue and maintain its existing business.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm CBAI.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	CBAI depends on its ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If Company information systems fail to perform as expected, or if the Company suffers an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	And Stability Of The General Economy.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as the current recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on our services.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Volatility In The Financial Market May Negatively Impact The Company s Ability To Access The Credit Markets.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile for micro cap companies.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited or prohibitively expensive, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors if the Company requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Company Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Its Operations.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	CBAI s success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of its President Chairman Joseph Vicente and Vice President and General Counsel Stephen Morgan.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The loss of either s services could materially harm the Company s business because of the cost and time necessary to find their successor.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	CBAI does not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on either Executive Officer.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The Company also has other key employees who manage its operations and if the Company were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	To the extent that the Company is smaller than its competitors and has fewer resources, the Company may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company is Involved in a Legal Proceeding, and an Adverse Outcome Therein Could Subject the Company to Substantial Damages and the Company s Assets Being Sold or Seized.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company is involved in a lawsuit, as set forth in detail in Item 3.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	An adverse outcome in the lawsuit could result in significant damages being awarded against the Company, which could also lead to the sale or seizure of Company assets.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Trading Of The Company Stock May Be Restricted By The Securities Exchange Commission s Penny Stock Regulations, Which May Limit A Stockholder s Ability To Buy And Sell The Company Stock.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	CBAI securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade Company securities.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P43_S6	The Company believes that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Failure To Establish And Maintain Effective Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Could Have An Adverse Effect On The Company s Business, Operating Results and Stock Price.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If CBAI is unable to maintain adequate internal controls, its business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	In October, 2009, the Company re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company s new principal office and laboratory operations are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	This facility encompasses approximately 17,000 square feet.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	The property is leased from an unaffiliated third party, whereby the original lease was for a period of five years ending September 2014 and the monthly lease payments are approximately $15,303, which includes Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	On January 21, 2014, the Company amended its current lease to include an extension through September 30, 2019.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P0_S5	The monthly lease payments will be adjusted in accordance with the amendment, along with possible adjustments to the CAM charges and potential rent abatement associated with total lease square footage and other factors, all as set forth more fully in Note 17.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company maintains fire and casualty insurance on its leased property in an amount deemed adequate by management.
1289496_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Argentina subsidiary leases a facility for operations in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	On August 30, 2013, Cord Blood America, Inc. (the Company ) filed a Complaint (the Complaint ) in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division against Tonaquint, Inc. ( Tonaquint ) and St. George Investments, LLC ( St. George ) (collectively Defendants ), along with summonses in connection therewith, case number 2:13-cv-00806-PMW (the Action ).
1289496_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company brought the Action against the Defendants alleging Fraud in the Inducement, Breach of Agreement, Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and Unjust Enrichment.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	In particular, among other things, the Complaint alleges that Defendants have fraudulently induced the Company to enter into the June 27, 2012 Secured Convertible Promissory Note ( Tonaquint Note ), Securities Purchase Agreement ( Tonaquint Purchase Agreement ) and related documentation through misrepresentations including but by no means limited to: (i) representing that the Tonaquint Note would be consecutively amortized with the March 10, 2011 Secured Convertible Promissory Note issued to St. George by the Company ( St. George Note ), and that these would not become due and owing simultaneously, and (ii) that the St. George Note would be replaced by an amended note to be paid off according to a set amortization schedule.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Company seeks relief in the form of rescission or reformation of the Tonaquint Note, St. George Note, the Warrant issued to St. George as part of the March 10, 2011 transaction, as well as related agreements and documents, an order enjoining Defendants from foreclosing on the Notes or selling the Company s assets, punitive and other damages in an unspecified amount, costs, attorneys fees, interest and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	Subsequently, on September 25, 2013, Defendants each filed their Answer and Counterclaim in the Action.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	In their Counterclaims, Defendants allege causes of action against the Company for Breach of the March 10, 2011 Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement between St. George and the Company ( SGI Purchase Agreement ), Breach of the Tonaquint Purchase Agreement and Tonaquint Note, Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Unjust Enrichment.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	Defendants claim that the Company purportedly breached the SGI Purchase Agreement, Tonaquint Purchase Agreement, and Tonaquint Convertible Note, by, among other things, failing to maintain a share reserve, failing to increase the number of authorized shares, failing to call or hold a meeting to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company, and failing to make installment payments under the Tonaquint Convertible Note.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P2_S3	Defendants seek relief in the form of damages in an unspecified amount and an order from the Court requiring the Company to establish and maintain a share reserve for the benefit of the Defendants, along with costs, attorneys fees and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P2_S4	On October 15, 2013, the Company filed its Reply to Counterclaim.
1289496_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	Also on September 25, 2013, the Company received from Tonaquint a Notice of Disposition of Collateral advising of Tonaquint s intent to sell all assets of the Company at a public auction on November 4, 2013 at 11:00 a.m.

1289496_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	CBAI defines critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require estimates and assumptions based on the Company's judgment of changing market conditions and the performance of its assets and liabilities at any given time.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	In determining which accounting policies meet this definition, the Company considered its policies with respect to the valuation of its assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	The Company believes the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following:
1289496_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue, other tissue procurement services and whole cord blood collection.

1289496_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables").
1289496_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Cord, Stellacure and Bio recognize revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Franchise revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 952-605-3, according to requirements for recognizing franchise revenues after franchise agreement services are completed and substantially performed.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Further, in accordance with ASC 952-605-25-7, the installment or cost recovery accounting method is used to account for franchise fee revenue only in those exceptional cases when revenue is collectible over an extended period and no reasonable basis exists for estimated collectability.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recognized $112,191 of franchise revenues.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company's total revenue slightly decreased to $5.97 million from $5.99 million, over the same period of 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Revenues are generated primarily from new enrollment/processing fees and recurring storage fees.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	The processing fees decreased approximately 11%, and the recurring revenues increased approximately 14% for the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the prior comparative period December 31, 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a mix of total revenue, recurring revenues account for 51% of total revenues, and processing fees 42% of the total revenues.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	Two secondary sources of revenue are franchise fees and tissue related sales.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S5	As a percentage of revenue in 2013 these two sources were approximately 7% of sales compared to 8% in the comparative year ending period of 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S6	Per segment, Cord s revenues were level at $3.80 million and Bio decreased its revenues by 1% for the prior comparative twelve month period.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S7	Bio's decrease in revenues were largely impacted by year over year adjustments to the current exchange rate of approximately 16% and an increase in the discounts provided for enrollment and processing fees.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P21_S8	Cord remains focused on strategic organic growth which management hopes will provide sustainable operating cash flows and net income.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 30% to 34% for the comparative year ending 2013 versus 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The cost of services includes transportation of the umbilical cord blood from the hospital to the lab, direct material plus labor costs for processing and cryogenic storage, and allocated rent, utility and general administrative expenses.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Gross profit decreased by approximately $0.23 million or 5% to $3.97 million from year ending 2012 to year ending 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Per segment, Cord s cost of services as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at approximately 28%, and Bio increased from 32% to 42%.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Company anticipates that through the growth and expansion of its Cord business, and continuing efficiencies in its own facilities, direct costs should continue to decrease and gross profits will continue to improve.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Administrative and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $5.12 million as compared to $5.63 million for the comparative period of 2012 representing a 10% decrease.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	These expenses are primarily related to marketing/advertising, professional services, allocated facility, including utilities, expenses, and wages for personnel.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Generally, each functional unit within administrative and selling expenses has reduced expenses.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	The Company continues to evaluate its expenses and their relationship to revenues for alignment.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P23_S4	Depreciation and amortization are included as an administrative expense.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P23_S5	For the year ended 2013, depreciation and amortization remained consistent with the 2012 year ending period total of $0.79 million.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company's loss from continuing operations was $3.04 million versus a loss of $2.39 million for the comparative period, resulting in an increase of 26% primarily attributable to an increase in the interest expense and change in derivative liability of $0.63 million.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The Company's net loss was $2.98 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 a decrease of $0.52 million from an overall net loss for the year ended 2012, which included a loss of $1.10 million for discontinued operations.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Total assets at December 31, 2012 were $6.08 million, compared to $6.35 at December 31, 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The decrease in the total assets is primarily related to the long term customer contracts and relationships which decreased by $0.63 million while current assets increased by $0.62.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	The total liabilities at December 31, 2013 were $6.4 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue $1.41 million, $0.59 million and $2.61 million respectively.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	At December 31, 2012, total liabilities were $6.35 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue $1.80 million, $0.54 million and $2.34 million respectively.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	Total liabilities increased by $0.61 million due to an increase in deferred revenue by $0.62 million.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P25_S5	The net impact of these changes resulted in total liabilities exceeding total assets by $0.37 million for the period ending December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	At December 31, 2013, the company had $0.71 million in cash, an increase by $0.32 million or 80% from the prior comparative period of 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company currently collects cash receipts from operations through Cord and its subsidiary Bio.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Cash flows from operations are currently sufficient to fund operations as net cash used provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $0.41 million or 509% from the prior comparative period of 2012, and resulted in Company operations generating $0.50 of cash for the year ending 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	During the last 12 months of 2013 there was no increase in notes payable for purposes of working capital or investment in affiliate companies.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	As a result, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.26 million and net cash provided by financing activities decreased from $0.43 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $0.00 million for the year ended 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Since inception, the Company has financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Over the past twelve months, the Company has reduced operating expenses, ended investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, and received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P27_S5	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its products, the Company could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

1289496_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	ASU 2013-02 amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 220, Comprehensive income ("ASC 220"), and requires entities to present the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income for the current period.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	Entities are required to present separately the amount of the change that is due to reclassifications, and the amount that is due to current period other comprehensive income.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	These changes are permitted to be shown either before or net-of-tax and can be displayed either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	ASU 2013-02 was effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued new guidance related to the release of cumulative translation adjustment related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The guidance clarifies that the guidance in Subtopic 830-30, Foreign Currency Matters - Translation of Financial Statements, applies to the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a reporting entity either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that constitute a business within a foreign entity.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	This guidance is effective for us prospectively for reporting periods beginning October 1, 2014.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	In April 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting .
1289496_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	ASU 2013-07 clarifies when an entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	ASU 2013-07 also provides principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and requirements for financial statements prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	ASU 2013-07 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	The Company does not expect amendments in ASU 2013-07 to impact the Company's financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists , which eliminates diversity in practice for the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is available to reduce the taxable income or tax payable that would result from disallowance of a tax position.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	ASU 2013-11 affects only the presentation of such amounts in an entity s balance sheet and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and interim periods within those years.
1289496_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1289496_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedule and notes thereto as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and for each of the two years then ended, together with the independent registered public accounting firm s reports thereon, are set forth on pages F-1 to F-23 of this Annual Report.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	It is management's responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that its disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including its president, vice president, and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The deficiency in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Company assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, its internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P10_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P10_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P11_S0	The deficiency in the Company's internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_14_ITEM9A_P11_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.

1289496_14_ITEM11_P1_S0	The following is a discussion of the Company program for compensating its named executive officers and directors.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P1_S1	Currently, the Company does not have a compensation committee, and as such, the Board of Directors is responsible for determining the compensation of the Company s named executive officers.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P2_S0	The primary goals of the Company policy of executive compensation are to attract and retain the most talented and dedicated executives possible, to assure that its executives are compensated effectively in a manner consistent with Company strategy and competitive practice, and to align executive s compensation with the achievement of the Company s short and long term business objectives.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P3_S0	The Board of Directors considers a variety of factors in determining compensation of executives, including their particular background and circumstances, such as their training and prior relevant work experience, their success in attracting and retaining savvy and technically proficient managers and employees, increasing its revenues, broadening the Company product line offerings, managing costs and otherwise helping to lead the Company through a period of profitable growth.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P4_S0	In the future, the Company expects that the Board of Directors will form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs of the Company and with the full authority to determine and approve the compensation of the Company s President and Vice President and make recommendations with respect to the compensation of other executive officers.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P4_S1	CBAI expects that its compensation committee will continue to follow the general approach to executive compensation that we have followed to date, rewarding superior individual and company performance with commensurate cash compensation.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Company s compensation program for the named executive officers consists primarily of base salary.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P5_S1	There is no retirement plan, long-term incentive plan or other such plans, although Mr. Vicente s and Mr. Morgan s agreements have a bonus plan, subject to the Board s discretion.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P6_S0	The base salary provided is intended to equitably compensate the named executive officers based upon their level of responsibility, complexity and importance of role, leadership and growth potential, and experience.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Company s named executive officers receive base salaries commensurate with their roles and responsibilities, while considering the financial condition of the Company.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P7_S1	Base salaries and subsequent adjustments, if any, are reviewed and approved by the Company s Board of Directors annually, based on an informal review of relevant market data and each executive s performance for the prior year, as well as each executive s experience, expertise and position.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P7_S2	The base salaries paid to the Company s named executive officers in 2013 are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Company previously provided equity awards as a component of compensation.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P8_S1	No such awards were provided in 2013, but the Company retains the position of providing such compensation considering a host of performance based criteria that will encourage executives to remain employed by the Company and also to attract persons of exceptional ability to become executives of the Company.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P9_S0	On September 12, 2011 (the Company ), entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Joseph R. Vicente, then the Company s Chief Operating Officer and Vice President and appointed Chairman and President on May 15, 2012 by the Board of Directors, which was effective as of August 1, 2011 and shall terminate as of December 31, 2014, unless earlier terminated by the Company or Mr. Vicente.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P9_S1	Mr. Vicente s Executive Employment Contract has an initial term from August 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, and is renewable annually thereafter for up to three additional, successive years, and provides for a base salary equal to his previous year s annual salary, which said salary was set under the provisions of the previous employment agreement entered between Mr. Vicente and the Company in July of 2008.

1289496_14_ITEM11_P9_S4	The Agreement provides for a change of control termination bonus, which provide that if Mr. Vicente is terminated, his compensation reduced, or Mr. Vicente terminates his employment within one year after a change of control, then Mr. Vicente is entitled to a termination benefit in an amount equal to the average annual cash compensation over the three (3) year period preceding the Triggering Event (defined in the agreements) multiplied (2.00).
1289496_14_ITEM11_P9_S5	The Agreement also provides for termination payments in the absence of a change of control in the event the Company terminates Mr. Vicente without cause in an amount equal to all compensation paid by the Company to Mr. Vicente for the 24 months preceding the termination, along with health plan and 401k incentives, as stated in the agreement.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Stephen Morgan (the Employee ) on August 10, 2012, with July 1, 2012 as the effective date of the Agreement.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Agreement provides for a change of control termination bonus, whereby if the Employee is terminated, his compensation reduced, or the Company terminates the Employee s employment within one year after a change in control, then the Employee is entitled to a termination benefit in an amount equal to the employee s cash compensation over the one (1) year preceding the Triggering Event (defined in the Agreement).
1289496_14_ITEM11_P10_S2	The Agreement also provides for termination payments in the absence of a change of control in the event the Company terminates the Employee without cause in an amount equal to all compensation paid by the Company to the Employee for the 12 months preceding the termination, along with health plan and 401k incentives (if any were to be offered the Company terminated its 401k earlier in 2012), as stated in the Agreement.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Agreement provides for an annual salary of $125,000, along with a bonus, payable at the discretion of the Board of Directors of up to an annual amount of 20% of the Employee s salary.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P11_S1	Mr. Morgan s compensation, as set forth in the Agreement has not increased as a result of his election to the officer positions of Vice President and Secretary on May 15, 2012 in addition to his retention of his previous position, General Counsel.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P12_S0	The Company believes the assumption of additional roles by existing management and other individuals in leadership positions, including filling recently vacated roles, will reduce overall management costs while also leading to greater efficiency within the organization.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Company did not provide its named executive officers with any perquisites and other personal benefits.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P13_S1	The Company does not view perquisites as a significant element of its compensation structure, but does believe that perquisites can be useful in attracting, motivating and retaining the executive talent for which it competes.
1289496_14_ITEM11_P13_S2	It is expected that the current practice regarding perquisites will continue and will be subject to periodic review by its Board of Directors.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	In March 2011, CBAI purchased a majority interest in Stellacure GmbH, a company providing private cord blood processing and storage services to families in Germany, Spain and Italy.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	On September 28, 2012, the Company sold its ownership interest in Stellacure, and the results of Stellacure and its disposal are reported as discontinued operations.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	The accompanying financial statements of CBAI and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $53.26 million as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	In addition, CBAI has notes and loans payable of approximately $1.44 million as of December 31, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company has no available common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2013, and as such, the Company may not be able to issue common stock to retire debt until such time as the shareholders approve an increase in the number of shares authorized.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P35_S3	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Since inception, the Company has financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P36_S3	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P36_S4	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the Company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P36_S6	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products, it could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P48_S2	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P48_S3	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances are more likely than not to reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount.

1289496_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	Interest and penalties totaled $0 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company files income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and various state jurisdictions.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	For jurisdictions in which tax filings are prepared, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by state tax authorities for years through 2007 and by the IRS for years through 2008.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company s share-based employee compensation plans are described in Note 11.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718 (previously SFAS 123(R), Accounting for Stock-based Compensation (Revised 2004) ( 123(R) ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants, including employee stock options.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Net loss per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding 747,129,414 and 252,661,081 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P67_S2	Outstanding options to acquire common stock and warrants are not included in the computation of net loss per common share because the effects of inclusion are anti-dilutive.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Concentrations of credit risk (whether on or off balance sheet) that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions described below.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Relationships and agreements which could potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of the use of one source for the processing and storage of all umbilical cord blood and one source for the development and maintenance of a website.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	The Company believes that alternative sources are available for each of these concentrations.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk could consist of cash balances maintained in excess of federal depository insurance limits.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high credit quality financial institutions.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	At times, cash and cash equivalent balances may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P70_S3	To date, the Company has not experienced any such losses.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Level inputs, as defined by ASC 820-10, are as follows:
1289496_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	Level 2 other significant observable inputs for the assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Level 3 significant unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2013 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

1289496_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the derivative liability:
1289496_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenues, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	The carrying amounts of the Company s notes receivable and notes payable approximates fair value based on the prevailing interest rates.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	Certain amounts in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , ("ASU 2013-02").
1289496_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	ASU 2013-02 amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 220, Comprehensive income ("ASC 220"), and requires entities to present the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income for the current period.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	Entities are required to present separately the amount of the change that is due to reclassifications, and the amount that is due to current period other comprehensive income.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P82_S3	These changes are permitted to be shown either before or net-of-tax and can be displayed either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	ASU 2013-02 was effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	In March 2013, the FASB issued new guidance related to the release of cumulative translation adjustment related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	The guidance clarifies that the guidance in Subtopic 830-30, Foreign Currency Matters - Translation of Financial Statements, applies to the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a reporting entity either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that constitute a business within a foreign entity.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	This guidance is effective for us prospectively for reporting periods beginning October 1, 2014.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P85_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	In April 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting .
1289496_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	ASU 2013-07 clarifies when an entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P86_S2	ASU 2013-07 also provides principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and requirements for financial statements prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P86_S3	ASU 2013-07 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2013.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P86_S4	The Company does not expect amendments in ASU 2013-07 to impact the Company's financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists , which eliminates diversity in practice for the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is available to reduce the taxable income or tax payable that would result from disallowance of a tax position.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	ASU 2013-11 affects only the presentation of such amounts in an entity s balance sheet and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and interim periods within those years.
1289496_14_ITEM15_P87_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1289496_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	Further pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Tonaquint Note was exchanged for a Secured Convertible Promissory Note of the Company in the principal amount of $2,500,000 (the "Company Note"), and certain of the other documents that were part of the June 27, 2012 transaction between the Company and Tonaquint (the June 2012 Tonaquint Transaction ) were terminated, cancelled or otherwise extinguished, and certain of them were amended, as set forth below.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	On December 22, 2014, the parties filed a Stipulated Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice the Action , and on that same day, the Court entered an Order of Dismissal, dismissing the Action in its entirety.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P23_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and very useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove approximately one liter of bone marrow.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P32_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	According to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, over 45,000 bone marrow and other hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant procedures were performed worldwide in 2002.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	In the past decade, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and storage of these cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the cord blood stored.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S4	This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S5	Stem cells have been successfully recovered from cord blood after at least twenty five years of storage in liquid nitrogen.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P37_S6	However, these cells may be able to retain their usefulness at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	An emerging source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord tissue for therapeutic use are Mesenchymal stem cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	Mesenchymal stem cells, which are abundant in the cord tissue, possess the ability to regenerate into connective tissues including nerves, bones, muscles and ligaments.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	While there are currently no clinically approved use for these stem cells, there are over 200 clinical trials underway, and many scientists view this source of stem cells as promising resource in the field of regenerative medicine.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	In more recent years, many of the private or family cord blood banks have begun offering cord tissue related processing and storage services on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P38_S4	Private cord blood banks typically offer to store a whole segment of the cord tissue, or a service where the Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the cord tissue, expanded, and then cryogenically stored.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P38_S5	Stem cells that have been isolated and expanded are more readily available for use, if such opportunity exists in the future.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Cord offers both whole segment and isolated cord tissue processing and storage services.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Cord s operations provide umbilical cord blood banking and cord tissue services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States and Puerto Rico.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	The Company s corporate headquarters re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA in October 2009.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Cord processes and stores cord blood and cord tissue in its own facility.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Cord provides the following services to each customer.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	A medical kit that contains all of the materials and instructions necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood and cord tissue at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for infectious disease testing.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood and cord tissue and maternal blood samples.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Manage all logistics for transporting the cord blood and cord tissue unit to the Company s centralized facility immediately following birth.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	This procedure ensures chain-of-custody control during transportation for maximum security.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	The cord blood sample is tested for stem cell concentration levels and blood type.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	The maternal samples are tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	Cord reports these results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood and cord tissue unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least twenty five years when stored in this manner, and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Additionally, the Company is procuring birth tissue for organizations utilizing the tissue in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic based products.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	The Company receives a one-time recovery fee per tissue.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	Associated services provided by the Company with this offering may include; transportation, collection materials, information used to determine donor eligibility and infectious disease testing of the maternal blood.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, primarily through organic growth.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	In March of 2010 the Company acquired pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non dilutable interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	In exchange for issuance of equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalties payable beginning in 2011.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	The Company has not been paid any royalty balance due to date, and it remains doubtful that any such royalties will be collected.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	In December of 2010 the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	As of December 31, 2014, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, provided a total of $400,000 in additional capital to Cayman, and is to receive Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 50 Cayman (TBD) Warrants.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Secured Convertible Promissory Notes are convertible into Cayman stock at a conversion price of $1,500 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	The Warrants have a five year term and are exercisable at an option exercise price of $0.05 per share per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	The Company recorded a reserve for the entire carrying value of the receivable of $458,706, including interest, as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	In March 2010, the Company acquired 138,712 Series B Shares of Stellacure, GmbH, which represents an ownership percentage of 51%, a German Limited Liability Company that is in the business of privately collecting, processing, and storing cord blood samples.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	The purchase price paid by the Company was EUR 501,000.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Stellacure operates primarily in Germany; however, it established sales channels in Spain and Italy in 2009.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	On September 28, 2012, the Company sold its 51% ownership interest in Stellacure of Hamburg, Germany to Medivision mbH.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	In line with the Company s strategy to focus on its cash producing operations in the US and Argentina, the sale included consideration of approximately $43,000 in a loan repayment, approximately $69,000 forgiveness of a remaining loan balance owed to Stellacure from Company, and a waiver against all past and future claims.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 644,888 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	The plan was scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P58_S4	However, Vivi subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	On April 13, 2011, the Company filed a Non Consummation of Confirmed Plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Company pursued its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all assets of NeoCells, ViviCells subsidiary.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Then, on April 22, 2011, ViviCells filed an adversary proceeding against the Company, in the same United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana), where ViviCells bankruptcy proceedings had been taking place (the Adversary Proceeding ).
1289496_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	ViviCells followed this by, in the Adversary Proceeding, filing a Motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2011, seeking to halt the foreclosure by the Company on the assets of NeoCells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	The complaint and the motion were amended on May 2, 2011, primarily by adding NeoCells, in addition to ViviCells, as a party to the adversary proceeding and the motion.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	The motion was heard on May 2, 2011.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	The motion was denied, and accordingly, the Company proceeded on May 2, 2011 at 1:00 pm (CST) to foreclose against all assets of NeoCells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	At the public disposition of all property owned by NeoCells, the Company as a secured creditor bid $320,000 in offset debt, and acquired all right, title and interest in said property free and clear of any liens, security interests and encumbrances which are junior and subordinate to the Company s security interest as a secured creditor.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	The tangible property acquired that the Company desired to retain was relocated to the Company s Las Vegas facility.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	On June 2, 2011, the Court entered an order dismissing the Adversary Proceeding, and on July 11, 2011, the Court entered an Order Closing Adversary Proceeding.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.1% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).
1289496_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Under the Agreement, the Company paid $375,000 in cash at the closing, and was obligated to pay an additional $350,000 in October, 2010, $150,000 of which is part of the fixed portion of the purchase price for the shares, for a total minimum purchase price of $525,000.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The remaining $200,000 of this payment represents advances against the contingent payments due based on Bio s 2010 and 2011 net income performances.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Agreement provides that the Shareholders are to be paid contingent earn-out compensation in 2011 based on achieving certain levels of net income in 2010 of which the Shareholders were paid $500,000.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	As of June 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with the shareholders of Bio from whom the Company purchased its majority ownership interest in Bio in 2010 (the "Sellers") relating to the 2011 earnout.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	U nder the Agreement, the Company would pay the Sellers the following: $25,000 on or before June 30, 2012; $10,000 on or before July 31, 2012; and $25,000 on or before September 30, 2012, for a total cash payment of $60,000.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	In addition, the Sellers would collect the Company s portion of BioCells shareholder dividends for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, up to a maximum amount of $440,000, if any.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S4	Also, if BioCells is sold before April 2014 and certain thresholds for purchase price and payment are met or exceeded, then the Sellers could receive additional compensation, specifically an amount which equals $705,000 minus any amounts paid pursuant to the cash payments and payments from the Company s shareholder dividends, which are detailed above.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S5	That sum would be paid to the Sellers out of the proceeds of such a sale.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P65_S6	All amounts owed by the Company described above have been paid in full.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Under the Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to pay the total amount of $705,000, as follows:
1289496_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	$5,000 on or before October 12, 2014; $10,000 on or before December 1, 2014 (past due); $15,000 on or before March 1, 2015 (past due); $15,000 on or before June 1, 2015; $45,000 on or before June 1, 2016; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2017; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2018; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2019; $65,000 on or before June 1, 2020; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2021; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2022; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2023; $80,000 on or before June 1, 2024; $80,000 on or before June 1, 2025.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Purchaser has defaulted on the December 1, 2014 and the March 1, 2015 payments.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Company has sent such default notice, demanded payment, and is accruing interest at a default interest rate of 12%.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that are incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	The second tranche provides the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_15_ITEM1_P70_S4	The Company loaned $153,092 (US) to VidaPlus during the year ended December 31, 2011 and $93,396 during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 in connection with the second tranche of this agreement.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P70_S5	Converting the investment from a loan into equity for tranche two is to take place within 24 months, and the obligation will have been met in full after 1,000 samples have been processed and stored.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	The third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	VidaPlus contracts through Stellacure and their relationship with the German Red Cross for their processing and storage.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under whether Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	CBAI holds a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	CBAI holds that pledge until such time as it converts the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into Vidaplus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	CBAI must make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which means that such conversion shall take place around or before February 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	CBAI also holds a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	On February 24, 2011, the Company acquired the following assets; 593 umbilical cord blood samples and all related file documents, four (4) cryogenic storage tanks, and two computers from Reproductive Genetics Institute, Inc. (RGI) for $76,000 in cash.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	The Company paid an additional $48,885 to RGI to cover claims related to ViviCells International for a total $124,885.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	In March 2011, the assets acquired were relocated to the Company s Las Vegas laboratory.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	The Company is one of an estimated thirty two (32) firms in the US providing private cord blood banking services, with approximately one half of those providing additional cord tissue related services.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	Internationally there are an estimated one hundred and twenty (120) additional firms offering these services.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	The Company has built its business in the United States ( US ) via a model of organic growth and accretive acquisitions.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	Management believes that in the US an organic differentiator for the Company is its emphasis on strategic relationships with larger health insurance providers and other organizations focused on health and wellness.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	This approach differs from the Company's major competitors who tend to focus on a traditional pharmaceutical model where field sales representatives cover a geographical market of ob/gyn practices.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	By focusing on the health insurance relationships, while the sales cycle is longer, once established, management believes the sales approach builds loyalty and recurring sales.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Company in parallel to its business to business sales approach is increasing its marketing efforts direct to the consumer via its digital presence.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	Management believes as the industry matures, and parents become increasingly educated on stem cell banking, more decisions will be made directly between the parents and the Company.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Company officially opened its own laboratory operations at its new facility in Las Vegas, Nevada in March, 2010.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	Previously the Company has outsourced these key scientific elements to a third party and was primarily a reseller of cord blood services.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	There are approximately 40% of the US private banking firms that continue to outsource laboratory operations to a third party.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P83_S3	Now, with this key expertise in house, the Company has the ability to continue making advancements on existing and new services related to stem cells as well as better manage laboratory costs, efficiencies and vendor relationships related to processing and storage.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P83_S4	Further demonstrating the increasing strength of the Company s operations, the Company sought and received its AABB Accreditation for cell therapy activity associated with cord blood processing, storage and distribution.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P83_S5	The Company believes this accreditation, while voluntary, was necessary to stay competitive with other industry participants, and further validates by an independent organization the quality of its operating practices.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Company at the present engages in limited research and development activities at its laboratory facility, but continues to evaluate the advancing science for opportunities that may exist in the future.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Management may add acquisitions that increase the recurring storage based revenues, assuming cost effective new sources of capital can be located to make such accretive acquisitions.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	To date, the Company has concluded seven acquisitions, and management believes multiple opportunities may exist in the future to acquire smaller competitors who do not have the financial resources or a large enough recurring revenue base from storage to compete on a go forward basis.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	Over the past year, the Company has seen increased discounting related to enrollment services which Management believes could be a leading indicator of industry consolidation.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Patents, Trademarks, Licenses or Royalty Agreements.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	PharmaStem Therapeutics claims to hold certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	In the past several years, PharmaStem has commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P87_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of our competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners could, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem s claimed technology and processes allegedly covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S4	Most of the patents at issue expired in 2010.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S5	PharmaStem could claim, arguendo , Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S6	Other than, potentially royalties, which would be disputed by Cord, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S7	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S8	As of 2008, Cord ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S9	The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P88_S10	As of December 31, 2014, the Company included approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 included in accrued expenses to account for this liability since 2008, though the Company disputes that it owes any royalties to Pharmastem.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Company relies upon a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in its business.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	The Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, vendors and others.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	The Company also seeks to control access to and distribution of its technology, documentation and other proprietary information.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The Company uses numerous trademarks, trade names and service marks for its products and services.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	CBAI also from time to time relies on a variety of intellectual property rights that the Company licenses from third parties.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	Although the Company believes that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licensed intellectual property, these third party properties and technologies may not continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	The steps the Company has taken to protect its copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	If this were to occur, it could harm its reputation and adversely affect its competitive position or results of operations.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Company and CBA Properties, Inc. own various trademarks utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	These trademarks include, among other marks, word marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) in two international classes for the words Cord Blood America, as well as design marks which incorporate the words Cord Blood America registered with the USPTO in two international classes, a design mark registered with the USPTO utilizing the word CorCell, along with other trademarks registered with the USPTO.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P92_S2	The Company also claims intellectual property rights in other words and designs not currently registered with the USPTO.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Company does not currently have any material capital expenditure commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of its properties.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	The Company does not believe compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, potential earnings or competitive position.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had sixteen full-time employees, and one part time employee.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	This includes the Company s Chairman of the Board and President, Vice President and General Counsel, its Tissue Bank Director, operations, laboratory, administrative, accounting, customer service and sales personnel.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P94_S2	The Company believes its relations with all of its employees are good.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Company makes available free of charge through its Internet website, www.cordblood-america.com , its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, (both XBRL compliant), current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
1289496_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	The SEC maintains an Internet website, www.sec.gov , which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information filed electronically with the SEC.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	Any materials that the Company files with the SEC may also be read and copied at the SEC s Public Reference Room, 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D. C. 20549.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Information on the operations of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1289496_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	The information provided on the Company s website is not part of this report and is not incorporated herein by reference.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The accompanying financial statements of Cord Blood America, Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	CBAI has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $53.45 million as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, CBAI has produced cash in its operating activities of approximately $0.78 million for the year ending December 31, 2014 and has notes and loans payable of approximately $1.35 million at year end 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Since inception, the Company has primarily financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	However, over the past eleven quarters, the Company has reduced operating expenses, ended investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, including the sale of its 51% ownership in Stellacure GmbH and 50.004% interest in Bio, received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital and begun to make payments on its remaining debt obligation.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the Company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its products, the Company could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company believes that the key to its success is to increase sales of its cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services, and birth tissue related procurement services; thereby increasing its revenues and available cash.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	CBAI s success with regard to cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-storage of cord blood and tissue, and its efforts to educate potential customers and sell its services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Broad use and acceptance of the Company s service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	CBAI may not have the resources required to promote its services and their potential benefits.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Continued commercialization of the Company services will also require that it satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of its services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for its services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If CBAI is unable to increase market acceptance of its services, the Company may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to maintain profitability or to continue its operation.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	For the Company s birth tissue related procurement services, success will depend in a large part on the increase in the demand in the products being developed by the organizations which the Company provides tissue, or ones which the Company may provide services to in the future.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If the Company is unable to meet the current or future demand of birth tissue from its sources, this emerging source of Company revenue may impact profitability and/or continuing operations.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If It Provides Poor Service, If Its Services Do Not Comply With Its Agreements Or If Its Storage Facilities Fail.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Company must meet its customers service level expectations and its contractual obligations with respect to its services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Failure to do so could subject the Company to liability, as well as cause it to lose customers.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In some cases, the Company relies upon third party contractors to assist in providing its services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	CBAI s ability to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of its third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Any material disruption in the Company's ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Company systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The Company may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If The Company Does Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, It May Not Be Able To Market Its Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking Services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The cord blood and cord tissue banking services, and tissue procurement services that the Company provides are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The facility the Company operates has registered with the FDA as a cord blood and cord tissue banking service and tissue procurement service.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Its products and services are registered with the FDA, and are subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The FDA has established a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as rules for donor suitability.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Consistent with industry practice, the Company s collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	CBAI s activities are regulated by the FDA under 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Procedures for all steps that the Company performs in testing, screening and determination of donor eligibility must be established and maintained requiring additional resources, staff and management oversight.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Significant costs are associated with maintaining compliance in accordance with current regulatory requirements.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The Company may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Of the states in which the Company provides services, only California, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The states of New York and California require that cord tissue banks be licensed as well.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	CBAI maintains the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood and tissue banking or procurement services, the Company may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Because The Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, The Company s Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Its Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services the Company provides.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for the Company's services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	CBAI believes that its future success will depend largely on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of its customers.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Expectant parents may not use Company services and its services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	And, In The Event Its Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Its Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Cord blood and cord tissue banking and stem cell processing and storage is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Company business faces competition from other operators of cord blood and cord tissue stem cell processing and storage businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter Company markets and compete with CBAI for increased market share.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Many competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than Company currently has.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Company has limited research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such research and development activities.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than the Company, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than the Company currently attracts.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on CBAI revenues and profitability.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	In the event that the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for CBAI to grow its revenue and maintain its existing business.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm CBAI.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	CBAI depends on its ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If Company information systems fail to perform as expected, or if the Company suffers an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	And Stability Of The General Economy.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on its services.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of the uncollectable accounts.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Volatility In The Financial Market May Negatively Impact The Company s Ability To Access The Credit Markets.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile for micro cap companies.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited or prohibitively expensive, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors if the Company requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Its Operations.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	CBAI s success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of its President Chairman Joseph Vicente and Vice President and General Counsel Stephen Morgan.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The loss of either s services could materially harm the Company s business because of the cost and time necessary to find their successor.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	CBAI does not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on either Executive Officer.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Company also has other key employees who manage its operations, and if the Company were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	To the extent that the Company is smaller than its competitors and has fewer resources, the Company may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.

1289496_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	CBAI securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.

1289496_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade Company securities.
1289496_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	The Company believes that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.

1289496_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables").
1289496_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Cord and Bio recognize revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Franchise revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 952-605-3, according to requirements for recognizing franchise revenues after franchise agreement services are completed and substantially performed.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Further, in accordance with ASC 952-605-25-7, the installment or cost recovery accounting method is used to account for franchise fee revenue only in those exceptional cases when revenue is collectible over an extended period and no reasonable basis exists for estimated collectability.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company did not recognize any franchise revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company's total revenue increased to $4.33 million from $3.82 million, over the same period of 2013, an increase of 13%.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Revenues are generated primarily from three sources; new enrollment/processing fees, recurring storage fees (both from cord blood and cord tissue) and the third related to the procurement of birth tissue for organizations utilized in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic products.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	New enrollment/processing fees decreased approximately 2% to $0.98 million while recurring storage revenues increased approximately 5% to $2.52 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the prior comparative period of December 31, 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	The slight decrease in enrollment fees was attributable to increased discounting associated with initial enrollment fees indicating a more competitive market.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	The total number of combined units of cord blood and cord tissue processed and stored increased year over year, as indicated by the 5% increase in recurring revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	The procurement of birth tissue increased from $0.39 million to $0.80 million in the year over year period of 2013 to 2014, an increase of 105%.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S6	This growth is attributable to an increase in the demand of birth tissue from an existing relationship, coupled with an additional procurement agreement in place during the third quarter of 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S7	As a mix of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, new enrollment/processing fees account for 23% of total revenues, recurring revenues account for 58% of total revenues, and the procurement of birth tissue 18% of the total revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S8	Comparatively for the period ended December 31, 2013, new enrollment/processing fees account for 26% of total revenues, recurring revenues account for 63% of total revenues, and the procurement of birth tissue 10% of the total revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P20_S9	Cord remains focused on strategic organic growth which management hopes will provide sustainable operating cash flows and net income.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 29% to 32% for the comparative year ending 2014 versus 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The cost of services includes transportation of the umbilical cord blood, cord tissue and birth tissue from the hospital, direct material plus labor costs for processing and cryogenic storage, collection kit materials and allocated rent, utility and general administrative expenses.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Gross profit increased by approximately $0.23 million or 8% to $2.90 million from year ending 2014 to year ending 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Company anticipates that through the growth and expansion of its Cord business, investment in automation, and continuing efficiencies in its own facilities, direct costs should decrease and gross profits will improve.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Administrative and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $3.10 million as compared to $2.91 million for the comparative period of 2013 representing a 7% increase.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	These expenses are primarily related to marketing/advertising, professional services, allocated facility, including utilities, expenses, and wages for personnel.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Legal expenses associated with the Company litigation of St. George and Tonaquint increased $0.40 million in the year over year period and were the primary contributor to the overall increase in administrative and selling expenses.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	Depreciation and amortization are included as an administrative expense.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	For the year ended 2014, depreciation and amortization was $0.47 million as compared to the year ended 2013 total of $0.54 million.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	The Company continues to evaluate its administrative and selling expenses for alignment with revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Company's income from continuing operations was $0.24 million versus a loss of $2.98 million for the comparative period for the year ending 2014 to 2013, resulting in an increase of $3.22 million.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The primary contributor to this increase is the one-time gain related the sale of Biocells.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Company's net income was $0.24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $2.71 million from an overall net loss of $2.47 million for the year ended 2013; again attributable to the sale of BioCells.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Total assets at December 31, 2014 were $3.86 million, compared to $6.08 million at December 31, 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The decrease in the total assets was primarily related to the sale of Bio which accounted for approximately $2.04 million in the year over year decrease.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	The total liabilities at December 31, 2014 were $4.55 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue $1.35 million, $0.36 million and $1.49 million respectively.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	At December 31, 2013, total liabilities were $6.09 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue $1.44 million, $0.34 million and $1.45 million respectively.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	Total liabilities decreased by $1.89 million, again primarily due to the sale of Bio.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P24_S5	The net impact of these changes resulted in total liabilities exceeding total assets by $0.69 million for the period ending December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	At December 31, 2014, the company had $0.75 million in cash, an increase of $0.04 million or 6% from the prior comparative period of 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Cash flows from operations are currently sufficient to fund operations as net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased $1.39 million to $0.78 million or 227% from the prior comparative period of 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	During the last 12 months of 2014 there was no increase in notes payable for purposes of working capital.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P25_S3	However, the Company did reach a settlement with St. George and Tonaquint as more fully described in Note 15.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P25_S4	Legal Proceedings, and made its first payment of $100,000 which is reflected as a use of cash in financing activities.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P25_S5	Net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.11 million as the Company increased its investment in property and equipment, and made a loan to Banco Vida.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Since inception, the Company has financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	Over the past twelve months, the Company has sold its equity stake in Bio, increased revenues, negotiated more favorable vendor relationship agreements, and received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its products, the Company could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The update requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	The guidance will be required to be applied on a retrospective basis, using one of two methodologies, and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application not being permitted.
1289496_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedule and notes thereto as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and for each of the two years then ended, together with the independent registered public accounting firm s reports thereon, are set forth on pages F-1 to F-23 of this Annual Report.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	It is management's responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s management, including its President and Principal Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that its disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including its President,Vice President, and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The deficiency in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Company assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, its internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's President and Principal Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P10_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P10_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	The deficiency in the Company's internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_15_ITEM9A_P11_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.

1289496_15_ITEM11_P1_S1	Currently, the Company does not have a compensation committee, and as such, the Board of Directors is responsible for determining the compensation of the Company s named Executive Officers.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P2_S0	The primary goals of the Company policy of executive compensation are to attract and retain the most talented and dedicated executives possible, to assure that its executives are compensated effectively in a manner consistent with Company strategy and competitive practice, and to align executive s compensation with the achievement of the Company s short and long term business objectives.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P3_S0	The Board of Directors considers a variety of factors in determining compensation of executives, including their particular background and circumstances, such as their training and prior relevant work experience, their success in attracting and retaining savvy and technically proficient managers and employees, increasing its revenues, broadening the Company product line offerings, managing costs and otherwise helping to lead the Company through a period of profitable growth.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P4_S0	In the future, the Company expects that the Board of Directors will form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs of the Company and with the full authority to determine and approve the compensation of the Company s President and Vice President and make recommendations with respect to the compensation of other executive officers.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P4_S1	CBAI expects that its compensation committee will continue to follow the general approach to executive compensation that we have followed to date, rewarding superior individual and company performance with commensurate cash compensation.

1289496_15_ITEM11_P5_S1	There is no retirement plan, long-term incentive plan or other such plans, although Mr. Vicente s and Mr. Morgan s agreements have a bonus plan, subject to the Board s discretion.

1289496_15_ITEM11_P7_S1	Base salaries and subsequent adjustments, if any, are reviewed and approved by the Company s Board of Directors annually, based on an informal review of relevant market data and each executive s performance for the prior year, as well as each executive s experience, expertise and position.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P7_S2	The base salaries paid to the Company s named Executive Officers in 2014 are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Company previously provided equity awards as a component of compensation.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P8_S1	No such awards were provided in 2014, but the Company retains the position of providing such compensation considering a host of performance based criteria that will encourage executives to remain employed by the Company and also to attract persons of exceptional ability to become executives of the Company.
1289496_15_ITEM11_P9_S0	On December 18, 2014, the Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Joseph R. Vicente, the Company s President and Chairman of the Board, which is effective as of January 1, 2015 and shall terminate as of December 31, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the Company or Mr. Vicente in accordance with the agreement (the Vicente Employment Agreement ).

1289496_15_ITEM15_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P11_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P11_S3	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P11_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P12_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cord Blood America, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P14_S2	Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P14_S3	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	Cord Blood America, Inc. ("CBAI" or the Company ), formerly D A Lending, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Florida on October 12, 1999.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	In October, 2009, CBAI re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	CBAI's wholly-owned subsidiaries include Cord Partners, Inc., CorCell Companies, Inc., CorCell, Ltd., (Cord Partners, Inc, CorCell Companies, Inc. and CorCell, Ltd. are sometimes referred to herein collectively as Cord ), CBA Properties, Inc.

1289496_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	In September 2010, CBAI purchased a majority interest in Biocordcell Argentina S.A. ( Bio ).
1289496_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	CBAI and its subsidiaries engage in the following business activities:
1289496_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	CBAI and Cord specializes in providing private cord blood and cord tissue stem cell storage services to families to families throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.

1289496_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	In September 2010, CBAI purchased a majority interest in Biocordcell Argentina S.A. (BioCells), a company providing private cord blood processing and storage services to families in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	On September 29, 2014, the Company sold its ownership interest in BioCells.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P22_S2	In conjunction with the disposition of BioCells, the gain on the sale and results of historical operations are recorded as discontinued operations in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P22_S3	Additionally, the cash flows from BioCells are reflected separately as cash flows from discontinued operations in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The accompanying financial statements of CBAI and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company has experienced recurring net losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $53.46 million as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	In addition, CBAI has notes and loans payable of approximately $1.35 million as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P24_S2	The Company thus far has made a payment in cash provided by continuing operations.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P24_S3	However, the Company has no available common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014, and as such, the Company may not be able to issue common stock to retire debt, if cash is not sufficient, until such time as the shareholders approve an increase in the number of shares authorized.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P24_S4	The Company has announced a Special Shareholders Meeting to increase the number of shares on April 10, 2015.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P24_S5	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Since inception, the Company has financed cash flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and warrants for cash, services and loans.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	However, over the past eleven quarters, the Company has reduced operating expenses, ended investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, and divested its equity stake in both Stellacure and Bio, and received no additional funding from outside sources for working capital.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company had positive cash flow from operations of $0.78 million.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S3	The Company plans to continue to operate on its cash flows from operations by aligning its expenses with its revenues.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S4	If cash flows from operations are significantly less than projected, then the Company would need to either cut back on its budgeted spending, look to outside sources for additional funding or a combination of the two.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S5	The Company currently does not have any financing agreements in place for additional funding.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P25_S6	If the Company is unable to access sufficient funds when needed, obtain additional external funding or generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products, it could be forced to curtail or possibly cease operations.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	In view of these conditions, CBAI's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to meet its financing requirements, and to ultimately achieve profitable operations.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event CBAI cannot continue as a going concern.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBAI and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, Cord and Biocordcell Argentina S.A. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits in banks with maturities of three months or less, and all highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	The company maintains cash and cash equivalents at several financial institutions.

1289496_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P31_S3	The allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P31_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred while major replacement and improvements are capitalized as additions to the related assets.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P33_S2	Sales and disposals of assets are recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation from the related asset and accumulated depreciation accounts with any gain or loss credited or charged to income upon disposition.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Intangible assets consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships as part of the acquisition of the CorCell and CureSource assets in 2007 in addition to the acquisition of Biocordcell in 2010 (Note 3).
1289496_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	During 2011 the Company also foreclosed and acquired assets from NeoCells, a subsidiary of ViviCells, as satisfaction of outstanding receivables from Vivicells.

1289496_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P37_S3	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances are more likely than not to reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount.
1289496_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Cord had a non-controlling equity investment in ViviCells International, Inc., a privately held company in the business of providing cord blood stem cell and adult peripheral blood stem cell preservation services.

1289496_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	In conjunction with the disposition of BioCells, the gain on the sale and results of historical operations are recorded as discontinued operations in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	Additionally, the cash flows from BioCells are reflected separately as cash flows from discontinued operations in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	On February 10, 2015, the Company filed a Definitive 14A Proxy Statement providing Notice that a Special Meeting of Shareholders would take place on April 10, 2015 at 10:00 a.m.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Pacific Standard Time at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The vote was to consider a proposal to amend the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company to increase the total number of shares of capital stock to 2,895,000,000, consisting of 5,000,000 Preferred Stock and 2,890,000,000 share of Common Stock.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Special Shareholders Meeting was held on May 7, 2015, and thereafter, the Company announced the increase in shares was approved by the shareholders.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Effective February 27, 2015 through February 27, 2018 the Company received its Accreditation from the American Association of Tissue Banks for the recovery of musculoskeletal tissue for transplantation and/or educational research.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Company believes this accreditation is important to its continued growth in the procurement of birth tissue for therapeutic and/or research based products.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	On March 31, 2015, the Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Stephen Morgan, the Company s Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, which is effective as of April 1, 2015 and shall terminate as of March 31, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the Company or Mr. Morgan in accordance with the agreement (the Morgan Employment Agreement ).

1289496_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Effective April 9, 2015, the Company entered into an Amendment to Executive Employment Agreement with Joseph R. Vicente, the Company s former President and Chairman of the Board, Stephen Morgan, the Company s former Vice President and now Interim President, amending their employment agreements, such that Mr. Vicente no longer had and Mr. Morgan no longer has the option, in their sole discretion, to receive their salary and bonus amounts in the form of Company stock, rather than cash.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	On April 9, 2015, the Company executed a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) and a Stockholder Agreement with Red Oak Fund LP, Red Oak Long Fund, LP and Pinnacle Opportunities Fund, LP (collectively the Purchasers or Red Oak ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Subsequently, on April 14, 2015, the Company and Red Oak closed the transaction.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers delivered to the Company, at Closing (defined in the Purchase Agreement), $724,000 (the Purchase Price ), and the Company delivered to the Purchasers 724,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Purchase Price proceeds were used as repayment of the Company s outstanding debt obligations.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	The terms of the Preferred Stock are set forth in Articles of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation of the Company ( Articles of Amendment ) that were designated by the Board of Directors of the Company on April 9, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	As set forth in the Articles of Amendment, the Preferred Stock was convertible into common stock of the Company at the Conversion Rate, where each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to common stock in accordance with the number of shares of Preferred Stock they hold divided by the total shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, 724,000 shares, multiplied by the Maximum Common Converted Share Number, which is 29.98% of the outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted and converted basis.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Purchase Agreement set forth that the Preferred Stock shall not be converted until such time as there are sufficient authorized common stock shares, which are not reserved for other purposes, in order that all of the Preferred Stock can be converted to common shares.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	When there are sufficient such shares, all of the Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted to common stock at the Conversion Rate.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Further pursuant to the Articles of Amendment, while Preferred Stock is outstanding, the holders of Preferred Stock, voting exclusively and as a separate class, were entitled to elect three (3) Directors to the Board of Directors of the Company (the Series A Directors ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	In addition, the Purchase Agreement set forth that on any matter presented to the stockholders for vote, the Preferred Stock shall vote as a class with the holders of common stock, and each share of Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to such number of votes as if the Preferred Stock were converted to common stock at the Conversion Rate.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	In accordance with the Red Oak Purchase Agreement, David Sandberg, Anthony Snow and Adrian Pertierra were elected as Directors of the Company, effective April 15, 2015.

1289496_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Mr. Vicente resigned as a Director and as President effective February 12, 2016.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	On April 17, 2015, the Board established compensation for non-management Directors of $5,000 per year, plus $1,000 per year for the Chairman of the Nominating Governance Committee (currently Adrian Pertierra), $2,000 per year for the Chairman of the Compensation Committee (currently Tim McGrath), $3,000 per year for the Chairman of the Audit Committee (currently Anthony Snow), and $4,000 per year for the Chairman of the Board (currently David Sandberg).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	David Sandberg, the Chairman of the Board, waived all board compensation for 2015 due to him.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	Joseph Vicente was to receive no compensation for serving as a Director.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	As a result of the increase in the authorized shares being approved by the shareholders on May 7, 2015, and per the terms of the Red Oak Agreement, the 724,000 shares of Preferred Stock held by Red Oak automatically converted into 381,052,632 common shares of the Company equivalent to 29.98% ownership in the Company.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	On April 15, 2015, the Company made a payment to Tonaquint in the amount of $750,000, principally with the funds from the Red Oak Agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	This pre-payment in accordance with the settlement documents between the Company and Tonaquint, applies to payments due on August 17, 2015 through February 17, 2016 (7 months); and a partial payment of $50,000 to the $100,000 balance due on March 17, 2016.

1289496_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The following proposals required the approval of 2/3 of the issued common shares did not pass:
1289496_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Proposal 3 to consider and act upon a proposal to approve an amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company to declassify the Board of Directors and to require that all directors stand for annual election; Proposal 4 to consider and act upon a proposal to approve an amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to change the shareholder vote required to amend Articles III, IV, and V of the Articles of Incorporation from a supermajority common shareholder vote requirement to a majority vote requirement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Finally, regarding Proposal 7, to conduct an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation, every three years obtained the most votes.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	On August 7, 2015, De Joya Griffith, LLC resigned as the Company s independent registered public accountants.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Company engaged RBSM, LLP to serve as the Company s independent registered public accountants as approved by the Company s Audit Committee.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	On August 17, 2015, the Company received a notice of termination from Cord Blood Caribbean, Inc.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	d/b/a Banco Vida ( Banco Vida ) with regards to both the Tissue Agreement and the Storage and Processing Agreement between the two companies, effective February 2016.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	The Company reached an amendment to the Tissue Agreement extending the agreement through February 7, 2018, and with automatic renewals for consecutive two (2) year terms, in perpetuity unless terminated prior to a renewal term or otherwise in accordance with the amendment.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	The parties have not yet reached an agreement regarding the Storage and Processing Agreement between the two companies, though Banco Vida continues to store samples with the Company.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	If the Storage and Processing relationship ends, revenue from storage and processing will be negatively impacted in 2016 unless the Company finds alternative or replacement sources.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	In September 2015, a customer of the Company s tissue procurement services informed the Company they expect a significant reduction in orders such that orders from this customer will be minimal in the foreseeable future.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	In March 2016, an additional customer of the Company s tissue procurement services informed the Company they would not be ordering tissue services for the foreseeable future.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	This reduction commenced in March 2016.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	In December 2015, the Company engaged an AABB accredited third party laboratory in order to process and store cord blood and cord tissue for the Company s customers.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	Concurrent with the engagement, the Company ceased processing cord blood and cord tissue samples, and does not provide storage services for those customers processing and storing samples since the engagement of the third party laboratory.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	Due to the engagement, the Company decided to forego its AABB accreditation.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Effective February 12, 2016, Mr. Vicente stepped down from his positions as a Director and as President of the Company.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	Mr. Vicente and the Company entered a Mutual Separation Agreement described below.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	Also on February 12, 2016, Stephen Morgan was appointed Interim President, along with his roles as Corporate Secretary and General Counsel.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	The Company and Mr. Morgan entered an amendment to Mr. Morgan s employment agreement set forth in detail in Note 14.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Effective February 12, 2016 (the Separation Date ), the Company entered a Mutual Separation Agreement with Mr. Vicente (the Separation Agreement ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Mr. Vicente stepped down from his positions as President and as a member of the Board.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Vicente is entitled to receive a severance, payable in equal monthly installments over the twenty four month period post separation, in an amount equal to all compensation paid by the Company to Mr. Vicente for the 24 months preceding the termination, including salary and bonus received by Mr. Vicente.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	Additionally, the Company will pay for the value of his health insurance premiums, in monthly installments, until the earlier of twenty-four months after the Separation Date or until Mr. Vicente or his dependents become eligible for group health insurance coverage through a new employer.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	Mr. Vicente is also entitled to payment of his salary through the Separation Date, payment for unused vacation days and payment for any unreimbursed expenses, and a bonus payment for work performed in calendar year 2015, payable within sixty (60) days of the Company completing its fiscal 2015 audit.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Mr. Vicente remains subject to the restrictive covenants contained in his January 1, 2015 employment agreement, including a covenant not to compete and a non-solicitation provision, and is subject to additional restrictive covenants in the Separation Agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and very useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove approximately one liter of bone marrow.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	According to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, over 45,000 bone marrow and other hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant procedures were performed worldwide in 2002.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	In the past decade, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and storage of these cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the cord blood stored.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S5	Stem cells have been successfully recovered from cord blood after at least twenty-five years of storage in liquid nitrogen.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P50_S6	However, these cells may be able to retain their usefulness at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	An emerging source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord tissue for therapeutic use are Mesenchymal stem cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Mesenchymal stem cells, which are abundant in the cord tissue, possess the ability to regenerate into connective tissues including nerves, bones, muscles and ligaments.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	While there are currently no clinically approved use for these stem cells, there are over 200 clinical trials underway, and many scientists view this source of stem cells as promising resource in the field of regenerative medicine.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	In more recent years, many of the private or family cord blood banks have begun offering cord tissue related processing and storage services on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	Private cord blood banks typically offer to store a whole segment of the cord tissue, or a service where the Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the cord tissue, expanded, and then cryogenically stored.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P51_S5	Stem cells that have been isolated and expanded are more readily available for use, if such opportunity exists in the future.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Cord facilitates whole segment cord tissue processing and storage services.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Cord s operations provide umbilical cord blood banking and cord tissue services to expectant parents throughout all 50 United States and Puerto Rico.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The Company s corporate headquarters re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA in October 2009.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Cord facilitates processing and storage of cord blood and cord tissue through an engagement with a third party laboratory.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Cord provides the following services to each customer.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	A medical kit that contains all of the materials and instructions necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood and cord tissue at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for infectious disease testing.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing any instruction necessary for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood and cord tissue and maternal blood samples.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Manage all logistics for transporting the cord blood and cord tissue unit to the Company s centralized facility immediately following birth.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	This procedure ensures chain-of-custody control during transportation for maximum security.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	The cord blood sample is tested by third parties engaged by Cord for stem cell concentration levels and blood type.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	The maternal samples are tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Cord reports these results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood and cord tissue unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	Data indicates that cord blood retains viability and function for at least twenty-five years when stored in this manner, and theoretically could be maintained at least as long as the normal life span of an individual.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Additionally, the Company is procuring birth tissue for organizations utilizing the tissue in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic based products.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	The Company receives a one-time recovery fee per tissue.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	Associated services provided by the Company with this offering may include transportation, collection materials, information used to determine donor eligibility and infectious disease testing of the maternal blood.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, primarily through organic growth.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	In March of 2010 the Company acquired, pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non dilutable interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	In exchange for issuance of equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalties payable beginning in 2011.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	The Company has not been paid any royalty balance due to date, and it remains doubtful that any such royalties will be collected.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	In December of 2010 the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	As of December 31, 2014, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, provided a total of $400,000 in additional capital to Cayman, and is to receive Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 50 Cayman (TBD) Warrants.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	The Secured Convertible Promissory Notes are convertible into Cayman stock at a conversion price of $1,500 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	The Warrants have a five year term and are exercisable at an option exercise price of $0.05 per share per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	The Company recorded a reserve for the entire carrying value of the receivable of $458,706, including interest, as of December 31, 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	In March 2010, the Company acquired 138,712 Series B Shares of Stellacure, GmbH, which represents an ownership percentage of 51%, a German Limited Liability Company that is in the business of privately collecting, processing, and storing cord blood samples.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	The purchase price paid by the Company was EUR 501,000.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Stellacure operates primarily in Germany; however, it established sales channels in Spain and Italy in 2009.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	On September 28, 2012, the Company sold its 51% ownership interest in Stellacure of Hamburg, Germany to Medivision mbH.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	In line with the Company s strategy to focus on its cash producing operations in the US and Argentina, the sale included consideration of approximately $43,000 in a loan repayment, approximately $69,000 forgiveness of a remaining loan balance owed to Stellacure from Company, and a waiver against all past and future claims.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	On May 5, 2010, the Company executed and funded a Debtor-In-Possession loan agreement with ViviCells International, Inc. a Florida corporation ( Vivi or the Debtor ), NeoCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, and AdultCells, Inc., an Illinois corporation, (jointly and severally referred to as the Subsidiaries ), for $200,000 secured by a super priority lien on the Debtor s and Subsidiaries assets.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	As additional consideration for this loan, the Company received 21% of the Debtor s outstanding Common Stock.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	The $200,000 loan carries interest at 10% per annum, with principal and all accrued interest all due and payable on March 15, 2011.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	In September 2010, the Company acquired an approximately $800,000 secured obligation of the Debtor held by a junior lien holder in ViviCell s bankruptcy proceeding, in exchange for the private issuance of 111,111 restricted shares of its Common stock to the holder of this secured obligation.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	On October 20, 2010, the Company as a co-proponent proposed a Plan of Reorganization for Vivi under the United States Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which the Company proposed to acquire an additional 74% of the outstanding shares of Vivi, which would give it in excess of 94% ownership in ViVi, in exchange for the issuance of up to 644,888 shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company s agreement to make an additional senior secured loan in the amount of $300,000 to Vivi as working capital upon consummation of the Plan.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Between June 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, the Company accelerated the date of its loan commitment, and loaned $100,000 out of the proposed $300,000 loan amount to Vivi in advance of the Plan confirmation, secured under the super priority lien.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	On February 16, 2011, a hearing on Confirmation of this proposed plan of reorganization was heard and approved.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	The plan was scheduled to be Effective as of April 1, 2011.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P71_S4	However, Vivi subsequently advised the Company that it would be unable to supply the full 94% plus ownership of Vivi s outstanding capital stock to the Company as required under the Plan.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	On April 13, 2011, the Company filed a Non Consummation of Confirmed Plan with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	The Company pursued its rights to foreclose as the holder of a super priority lien against all assets of NeoCells, ViviCells subsidiary.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	Then, on April 22, 2011, ViviCells filed an adversary proceeding against the Company, in the same United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana), where ViviCells bankruptcy proceedings had been taking place (the Adversary Proceeding ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	ViviCells followed this by, in the Adversary Proceeding, filing a Motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25, 2011, seeking to halt the foreclosure by the Company on the assets of NeoCells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	The complaint and the motion were amended on May 2, 2011, primarily by adding NeoCells, in addition to ViviCells, as a party to the adversary proceeding and the motion.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The motion was heard on May 2, 2011.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	The motion was denied, and accordingly, the Company proceeded on May 2, 2011 at 1:00 pm (CST) to foreclose against all assets of NeoCells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	At the public disposition of all property owned by NeoCells, the Company as a secured creditor bid $320,000 in offset debt, and acquired all right, title and interest in said property free and clear of any liens, security interests and encumbrances which are junior and subordinate to the Company s security interest as a secured creditor.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	The tangible property acquired that the Company desired to retain was relocated to the Company s Las Vegas facility.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	On June 2, 2011, the Court entered an order dismissing the Adversary Proceeding, and on July 11, 2011, the Court entered an Order Closing Adversary Proceeding.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.004% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Under the Agreement, the Company paid $375,000 in cash at the closing, and was obligated to pay an additional $350,000 in October, 2010, $150,000 of which is part of the fixed portion of the purchase price for the shares, for a total minimum purchase price of $525,000.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	The remaining $200,000 of this payment represents advances against the contingent payments due based on Bio s 2010 and 2011 net income performances.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The Agreement provides that the Shareholders are to be paid contingent earn-out compensation in 2011 based on achieving certain levels of net income in 2010 of which the Shareholders were paid $500,000.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	As of June 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with the shareholders of Bio from whom the Company purchased its majority ownership interest in Bio in 2010 (the "Sellers") relating to the 2011 earnout.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	U nder the Agreement, the Company would pay the Sellers the following: $25,000 on or before June 30, 2012; $10,000 on or before July 31, 2012; and $25,000 on or before September 30, 2012, for a total cash payment of $60,000.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	In addition, the Sellers would collect the Company s portion of BioCells shareholder dividends for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, up to a maximum amount of $440,000, if any.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S4	Also, if BioCells is sold before April 2014 and certain thresholds for purchase price and payment are met or exceeded, then the Sellers could receive additional compensation, specifically an amount which equals $705,000 minus any amounts paid pursuant to the cash payments and payments from the Company s shareholder dividends, which are detailed above.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S5	That sum would be paid to the Sellers out of the proceeds of such a sale.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P78_S6	All amounts owed by the Company described above have been paid in full.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Under the Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to pay the total amount of $705,000, as follows:
1289496_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	$5,000 on or before October 12, 2014; $10,000 on or before December 1, 2014; $15,000 on or before March 1, 2015; $15,000 on or before June 1, 2015; $45,000 on or before June 1, 2016; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2017; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2018; $55,000 on or before June 1, 2019; $65,000 on or before June 1, 2020; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2021; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2022; $75,000 on or before June 1, 2023; $80,000 on or before June 1, 2024; $80,000 on or before June 1, 2025.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Purchaser is current with the payment schedule as of December 31, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that are incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	The second tranche provides the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	The Company loaned $153,092 (US) to VidaPlus during the year ended December 31, 2011 and $93,396 during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 in connection with the second tranche of this agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P83_S5	Converting the investment from a loan into equity for tranche two is to take place within 24 months, and the obligation will have been met in full after 1,000 samples have been processed and stored.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	The third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	VidaPlus contracts through Stellacure and their relationship with the German Red Cross for their processing and storage.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under whether Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	CBAI holds a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	CBAI holds that pledge until such time as it converts the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into Vidaplus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	CBAI must make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which means that such conversion shall take place around or before February 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P88_S3	CBAI also holds a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	On February 24, 2011, the Company acquired the following assets; 593 umbilical cord blood samples and all related file documents, four (4) cryogenic storage tanks, and two computers from Reproductive Genetics Institute, Inc. (RGI) for $76,000 in cash.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Company paid an additional $48,885 to RGI to cover claims related to ViviCells International for a total $124,885.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P90_S2	In March 2011, the assets acquired were relocated to the Company s Las Vegas laboratory.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	The Company is one of an estimated thirty (30) firms in the US providing private cord blood banking services, with approximately one half of those providing additional cord tissue related services.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	Internationally there are an estimated one hundred and twenty (120) additional firms offering these services.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	The Company has built its business in the United States ( US ) via a model of organic growth and accretive acquisitions.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	Management believes that in the US an organic differentiator for the Company is its emphasis on strategic relationships with larger health insurance providers and other organizations focused on health and wellness.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	This approach differs from the Company's major competitors who tend to focus on a traditional pharmaceutical model where field sales representatives cover a geographical market of ob/gyn practices.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P93_S2	By focusing on the health insurance relationships, while the sales cycle is longer, once established, management believes the sales approach builds loyalty and recurring sales.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	The Company in parallel to its business to business sales approach is increasing its marketing efforts direct to the consumer via its digital presence.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	Management believes as the industry matures, and parents become increasingly educated on stem cell banking, more decisions will be made directly between the parents and the Company.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	Management may execute acquisitions that increase the base of recurring storage based revenues, with a focus on valuation and financing such acquisitions to maximize return on invested capital.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	To date, the Company has concluded seven acquisitions, and management believes multiple opportunities may exist in the future to acquire smaller competitors who do not have the financial resources or a large enough recurring revenue base from storage to compete on a go forward basis.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P96_S2	Over the past year, the Company has seen increased discounting related to enrollment services which Management believes could be a leading indicator of industry consolidation.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	Patents, Trademarks, Licenses or Royalty Agreements.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	PharmaStem Therapeutics claims to hold certain patents relating to the storage, expansion and use of hematopoietic stem cells.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	In the past several years, PharmaStem has commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P98_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of our competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners could, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem s claimed technology and processes allegedly covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S4	Most of the patents at issue expired in 2010.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S5	PharmaStem could claim, arguendo , Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S6	Other than, potentially royalties, which would be disputed by Cord, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S7	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S8	As of 2008, Cord ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P99_S9	The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter.

1289496_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	CBAI also from time to time relies on a variety of intellectual property rights that the Company licenses from third parties.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	Although the Company believes that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licensed intellectual property, these third party properties and technologies may not continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	The steps the Company has taken to protect its copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	If this were to occur, it could harm its reputation and adversely affect its competitive position or results of operations.

1289496_16_ITEM1_P104_S1	The Company does not believe compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, potential earnings or competitive position.

1289496_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	Effective February 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Executive Employment Agreement with Stephen Morgan (the Second Amendment ), amending his original, April 1, 2015 employment agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	The Second Amendment reflects a five thousand dollar ($5,000) increase in Mr. Morgan s annual salary during the period Mr. Morgan serves as interim President, which period commenced on February 12, 2016 and shall end at any time on three (3) days notice by the Company (the Interim Term ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P109_S2	The Amendment further provides that the increase in Mr. Morgan s salary shall not be included in any severance calculations, including the severance calculations set forth in Sections 5(e) and 5(f) of his original agreement, and that upon termination of the Interim Term for any reason, Mr. Morgan s employment, duties and salary shall revert back to what they were prior to the Second Amendment.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	Effective February 12, 2016 (the Separation Date ), the Company entered a Mutual Separation Agreement with Mr. Vicente (the Separation Agreement ).
1289496_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Mr. Vicente stepped down from his positions as President and as a member of the Board.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P110_S2	Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Vicente is entitled to receive a severance, payable in equal monthly installments over the twenty four month period post separation, in an amount equal to all compensation paid by the Company to Mr. Vicente for the 24 months preceding the termination, including salary and bonus received by Mr. Vicente.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P110_S3	Additionally, the Company will pay for the value of his health insurance premiums, in monthly installments, until the earlier of twenty-four months after the Separation Date or until Mr. Vicente or his dependents become eligible for group health insurance coverage through a new employer.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P110_S4	Mr. Vicente is also entitled to payment of his salary through the Separation Date, payment for unused vacation days and payment for any unreimbursed expenses, and a bonus payment for work performed in calendar year 2015, payable within sixty (60) days of the Company completing its fiscal 2015 audit.
1289496_16_ITEM1_P111_S0	Mr. Vicente remains subject to the restrictive covenants contained in his January 1, 2015 employment agreement, including a covenant not to compete and a non-solicitation provision, and is subject to additional restrictive covenants in the Separation Agreement.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company believes that the key to its success is to increase sales of its cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services, and birth tissue related procurement services; thereby increasing its revenues and available cash.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	CBAI s success with regard to cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-storage of cord blood and tissue, and its efforts to educate potential customers and sell its services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Broad use and acceptance of the Company s service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	CBAI may not have the resources required to promote its services and their potential benefits.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Continued commercialization of the Company s services will also require that it satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of its services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for its services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	If CBAI is unable to increase market acceptance of its services, the Company may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to maintain profitability or to continue its operation.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	For the Company s birth tissue related procurement services, success will depend in a large part on the increase in the demand in the products being developed by the organizations for which the Company provides tissue, or ones to which the Company may provide services in the future.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If the Company is unable to meet the current or future demand of birth tissue from its sources, this emerging source of Company revenue may impact profitability and/or continuing operations.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If It Provides Poor Service, If Its Services Do Not Comply With Its Agreements Or If Its Storage Facilities Fail.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company must meet its customers service level expectations and its contractual obligations with respect to its services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Failure to do so could subject the Company to liability, as well as cause it to lose customers.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In some cases, the Company relies upon third party contractors to assist in providing its services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	CBAI s ability to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of its third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Any material disruption in the Company's ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The Company systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Company may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If The Company Does Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, It May Not Be Able To Market Its Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking Services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The cord blood and cord tissue banking services, and tissue procurement services that the Company provides are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The facility the Company operates has registered with the FDA as a cord blood and cord tissue banking service and tissue procurement service.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Its products and services are registered with the FDA, and are subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The FDA has established a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as rules for donor suitability.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Consistent with industry practice, the Company s collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	CBAI s activities are regulated by the FDA under 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Procedures for all steps that the Company performs in testing, screening and determination of donor eligibility must be established and maintained requiring additional resources, staff and management oversight.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Significant costs are associated with maintaining compliance in accordance with current regulatory requirements.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The Company may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Of the states in which the Company provides services, only California, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The states of New York and California require that cord tissue banks be licensed as well.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	CBAI maintains the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	CBAI s third party laboratory does not maintain all of the required service licenses in the states of New York and Maryland, but CBAI anticipates the third party laboratory will seek these licenses.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood and tissue banking or procurement services, the Company and its third party laboratory may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Because The Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, The Company s Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Its Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services the Company provides.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for the Company's services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	CBAI believes that its future success will depend largely on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of its customers.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Expectant parents may not use Company services and its services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In The Event The Company Is Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Its Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Cord blood and cord tissue banking and stem cell processing and storage is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company faces competition from other operators of cord blood and cord tissue stem cell processing and storage businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter Company markets and compete with CBAI for increased market share.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Many competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than Company currently has.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The Company has no research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such research and development activities.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than the Company, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than the Company currently attracts.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on CBAI revenues and profitability.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	In the event that the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for CBAI to grow its revenue and maintain its existing business.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm CBAI.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	CBAI depends on its ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If Company information systems fail to perform as expected, or if the Company suffers an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	And Stability Of The General Economy.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on its services.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of the uncollectable accounts.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Volatility In The Financial Market May Negatively Impact The Company s Ability To Access The Credit Markets.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile for microcap companies.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited or prohibitively expensive, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors if the Company requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Its Operations.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	CBAI s success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of its Interim President and General Counsel Stephen Morgan.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The loss of his services could materially harm the Company s business because of the cost and time necessary to find a successor.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	CBAI does not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on its Executive Officer.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company also has other key employees who manage its operations, and if the Company were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	To the extent that the Company is smaller than its competitors and has fewer resources, the Company may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company Could Fail to Retire Its Remaining Debt Obligation Which Could Subject the Company To A Default, And If Not Remedied, The Company s Assets Being Sold or Seized.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company settled a lawsuit in December 2014, as set forth more fully in Note 13.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If the Company is unable to pay the monthly installment amount of $100,000 per the terms described in the Settlement Agreement, the Company would be in default, with increased costs and possible acceleration of the note balance in full if not remedied within a prescribed timeline.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If unable to meet default and/or acceleration conditions of the Agreement, the obligations are secured by the Company assets which could lead to the sale or seizure of Company assets.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Such an adverse outcome could be significant to the Company s results of operations and may limit the Company s ability to engage in its business activities.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Trading Of The Company Stock May Be Restricted By The Securities Exchange Commission s Penny Stock Regulations, Which May Limit A Stockholder s Ability To Buy And Sell The Company Stock.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	CBAI securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade Company securities.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P30_S6	The Company believes that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Failure To Establish And Maintain Effective Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Could Have An Adverse Effect On The Company s Business, Operating Results and Stock Price.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If CBAI is unable to maintain adequate internal controls, its business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	In October, 2009, the Company re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company s new principal office and laboratory operations are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	This facility encompasses approximately 17,000 square feet.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	The property is leased from an unaffiliated third party, whereby the original lease was for a period of five years ending September 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	On January 21, 2014, the Company amended its current lease to include an extension through September 30, 2019.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S5	The monthly lease payments are approximately $15,146, which includes Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P0_S6	The lease payments will be adjusted in accordance with the amendment, along with possible adjustments to the CAM charges and potential rent abatement associated with total lease square footage and other factors, all as set forth more fully in Note 7.
1289496_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company maintains fire and casualty insurance on its leased property in an amount deemed adequate by management.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company Common Stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, under the symbol CBAI.OB.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices of the Company s Common Stock traded on the OTC Bulletin Board for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not represent actual transactions.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of March 15, 2016, the Company Common Stock was held by approximately 664 shareholders of record.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The Company s transfer agent is Interwest Transfer Company, Inc., with offices at 1981 Murray Holiday Road, Suite 100, Salt Lake City, Utah 84117, phone number (801) 272-9294.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with the common shares of stock.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	The Company has never declared or paid a cash dividend.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	There are legal restrictions which preclude the Company's ability to pay cash dividends on its common shares so long as it has an accumulated deficit.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	The Company does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	(d) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following table sets forth the information indicated with respect to the Company's compensation plans as of December 31, 2015, under which its common stock is authorized for issuance.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	In the instances described under this sub-heading, the Company relied upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in issuing securities.
1289496_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	On April 9, 2015, Cord Blood America, Inc. (the "Company") executed a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) and a Stockholder Agreement with Red Oak Fund LP, Red Oak Long Fund, LP and Pinnacle Opportunities Fund, LP (collectively the Purchasers or Red Oak ).

1289496_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	CBAI defines critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require estimates and assumptions based on the Company's judgment of changing market conditions and the performance of its assets and liabilities at any given time.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	In determining which accounting policies meet this definition, the Company considered its policies with respect to the valuation of its assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Company believes the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following:
1289496_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for facilitating the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue, and for tissue procurement services.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Accounts receivable relating to deferred revenues are netted against deferred revenue for presentation purposes.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	The allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables").
1289496_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Cord and Bio recognize revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Franchise revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 952-605-3, according to requirements for recognizing franchise revenues after franchise agreement services are completed and substantially performed.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Further, in accordance with ASC 952-605-25-7, the installment or cost recovery accounting method is used to account for franchise fee revenue only in those exceptional cases when revenue is collectible over an extended period and no reasonable basis exists for estimated collectability.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company did not recognize any franchise revenues.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	"Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities"), requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and in accordance with ASC 815-40-15 (formerly EITF 00-19 "Accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock") to determine whether they should be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Binomial option pricing formula and present value pricing.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company adjusted its derivative liability to its fair value, and reflected the change in fair value, in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's total revenue increased to $5.26 million from $4.33 million over the same period of 2014, an increase of 21%.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Revenues are generated primarily from three sources: new enrollment/processing fees; recurring storage fees (both from cord blood and cord tissue); and services related to the procurement of birth tissue for organizations utilized in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic products.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	The increase in revenue is due to growth in recurring storage fees and fees from procurement of birth tissue related services.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	Recurring storage revenues increased approximately 4% to $2.61 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus $2.52 million for the prior comparative year ended December 31, 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P22_S4	Revenues from the procurement of birth tissue increased to $1.73 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $0.80 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 116%.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P22_S5	This growth is attributable to an increase in the demand of birth tissue from existing relationships for 2015 as compared to 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 32% to 35% for the comparative year ending 2015 versus 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The cost of services includes transportation of the umbilical cord blood, cord tissue and birth tissue from the hospital, direct material plus labor costs for processing and cryogenic storage, collection kit materials and allocated rent, utility and general administrative expenses.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Gross profit increased by approximately $0.43 million or 15% to $3.4 million from year ending 2014 to year ending 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	The Company s aim is that through a focus on efficiencies, direct costs should decrease and gross profits improve.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Administrative and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.0 million as compared to $3.10 million for the comparative period of 2014, representing a 4% decrease.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	These expenses are primarily related to marketing/advertising, professional services, allocated facility, including utilities, expenses, and wages for personnel.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	The Company continues to evaluate its administrative and selling expenses for alignment with revenues.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company's net income was $.44 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.19 million from $0.24 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Total assets at December 31, 2015 were $3.7 million, compared to $3.86 million at December 31, 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The total liabilities at December 31, 2015 were $3.23 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue of $0.7 million, $0.15 million, and $1.6 million respectively.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	The total liabilities at December 31, 2014 were $4.55 million consisting primarily of Promissory Notes, Accounts Payable and Deferred Revenue of $1.35 million, $0.36 million and $1.49 million respectively.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Total liabilities decreased by $1.33 million, primarily due to pay down of Promissory Notes.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	The net impact of these changes resulted in total assets exceeding total liabilities by $0.47 million for the period ending December 31, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	At December 31, 2015, the company had $0.79 million in cash, an increase of $0.04 million or 5% from the prior comparative period of 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Cash flows from operations are currently sufficient to fund operations, though net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $0.73 million from $0.78 million from the prior comparative period of 2014.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	During the last 12 months of 2015 there was no increase in notes payable for purposes of working capital, and the Company made payments toward notes payable to Tonaquint, Inc., as more fully described in Note 5.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	Notes and Loans Payable, and Derivative Liabilities.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company has incurred losses since its inception through December 31, 2014, as development and infrastructure costs were incurred in advance of obtaining customers.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	However, the Company has net income and cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Starting in 2014, the Company's management commenced a plan to reduce operating expenses to be commensurate with operating cash flows.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Prior to 2015, the Company has relied on debt to provide capital for working capital needs.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Management has taken several actions to ensure that the Company will continue as a going concern, including the divesture of its investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, including the sale of its 51% ownership in Stellacure GmbH and 50.004% interest in Biocordcell Argentina S.A., headcount reductions, and reductions in discretionary expenditures.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	These changes effected by the Company's management resulted in the Company generating cash flow from operations in 2015, and the Company did not require additional debt or equity capital from external sources.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Further, the Company has reduced its debt via the repayment of the principal balance.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	Management plans to continue to implement its business plan and to fund operations through operating revenue and a corresponding increase in the amount of net income from its operations.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	The Company expects that cash flow from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	Management's objective is to continue to monitor and manage expenses relative to its revenue such that it will continue to generate operating cash flows to meet its operating cash requirements.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P31_S6	Management believes that these actions will enable the Company to continue as a going concern through March 31, 2017.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, the Company will: identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year for all entities and permits early adoption on a limited basis.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017.
1289496_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1289496_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedule and notes thereto as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and for each of the two years then ended, together with the independent registered public accounting firm s reports thereon, are set forth on pages F-1 to F-20 of this Annual Report.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	It is management's responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s management, including its President and Principal Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that its disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including its President and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The deficiency in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	The Company assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, its internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's President and Principal Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P10_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P10_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2015.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P11_S0	The deficiency in the Company's internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_16_ITEM9A_P11_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.

1289496_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers.
1289496_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The update requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
1289496_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

1289496_16_ITEM15_P121_S3	In the event the Company prepays an amount that is less than the outstanding amount, then the prepayment amount shall be applied to the next Installment Amount(s) due under the Company Note.
1289496_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	For each monthly payment, the Company may elect to designate all or any portion of the Installment Amount then due as a conversion eligible amount (hereafter Conversion Eligible Amount provided that the total outstanding Conversion Eligible Amount that has not been converted by Tonaquint, as set forth below, at any given time may not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) without Tonaquint s prior written consent and subject to additional restrictions set forth in the Company Note.
1289496_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	In the event the Company designates any portion of any monthly payment amount as a Conversion Eligible Amount, the applicable monthly payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion thereof designated as a Conversion Eligible Amount.
1289496_16_ITEM15_P122_S2	The Conversion Eligible Amount shall continue to be included in and be deemed to be a part of the Outstanding Balance (defined in the Company Note) of the Company Note unless and until such amount is either paid in cash by the Company or converted into Common Stock by Tonaquint.

1289496_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove bone marrow.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P20_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	In the past decades, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and storage of these cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the cord blood stored.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P25_S4	This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	An emerging source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord tissue for therapeutic use are Mesenchymal stem cells.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Mesenchymal stem cells, which are abundant in the cord tissue, possess the ability to regenerate into connective tissues including nerves, bones, muscles and ligaments.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	While there are currently no clinically approved use for these stem cells, there are clinical trials underway, and many scientists view this source of stem cells as promising resource in the field of regenerative medicine.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P26_S3	In more recent years, many of the private or family cord blood banks have begun offering cord tissue related processing and storage services on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P26_S4	Private cord blood banks typically offer to store a whole segment of the cord tissue, or a service where the Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the cord tissue, expanded, and then cryogenically stored.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P26_S5	Cord facilitates whole segment cord tissue processing and storage services.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Cord s operations facilitate umbilical cord blood banking and cord tissue services to expectant parents.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	The Company s corporate headquarters re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA in October 2009.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.

1289496_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	A medical kit that contains all of the materials and instructions necessary for collecting the newborn s umbilical cord blood and cord tissue at birth and packaging the unit for transportation.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The kit also provides for collecting a maternal blood sample for infectious disease testing.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	24-hour consulting services to customers as well as to physicians and labor and delivery personnel, providing instruction for the successful collection, packaging, and transportation of the cord blood and cord tissue and maternal blood samples.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Manage all logistics for transporting the cord blood and cord tissue unit to the Company s third party facility immediately following birth.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	This procedure ensures chain-of-custody control during transportation for maximum security.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The cord blood sample is tested by third parties engaged by Cord for stem cell concentration levels and blood type.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	The maternal samples are tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	Cord reports results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood and cord tissue unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	For new customers, this process is conducted at a third party laboratory.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Additionally, the Company provides services related to procuring birth tissue for organizations utilizing the tissue in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic based products.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Company receives a one-time recovery fee per tissue.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	Associated services provided by the Company with this offering may include arranging for transportation, providing collection materials, facilitating information used to determine donor eligibility and arranging for infectious disease testing of the maternal blood.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, primarily through organic growth.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.004% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).
1289496_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Under the Agreement, the Company paid $375,000 in cash at the closing, and was obligated to pay an additional $350,000 in October, 2010, $150,000 of which is part of the fixed portion of the purchase price for the shares, for a total minimum purchase price of $525,000.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	The remaining $200,000 of this payment represents advances against the contingent payments due based on Bio s 2010 and 2011 net income performances.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Agreement provides that the Shareholders are to be paid contingent earn-out compensation in 2011 based on achieving certain levels of net income in 2010 of which the Shareholders were paid $500,000.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	As of June 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with the shareholders of Bio from whom the Company purchased its majority ownership interest in Bio in 2010 (the "Sellers") relating to the 2011 earnout.

1289496_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	In addition, the Sellers would collect the Company s portion of BioCells shareholder dividends for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, up to a maximum amount of $440,000, if any.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P39_S4	Also, if BioCells is sold before April 2014 and certain thresholds for purchase price and payment are met or exceeded, then the Sellers could receive additional compensation, specifically an amount which equals $705,000 minus any amounts paid pursuant to the cash payments and payments from the Company s shareholder dividends, which are detailed above.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P39_S5	That sum would be paid to the Sellers out of the proceeds of such a sale.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P39_S6	All amounts owed by the Company described above have been paid in full.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Under the Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to pay the total amount of $705,000, as follows:

1289496_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	The Purchaser is current with the payment schedule as of December 31, 2016.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that were incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P44_S3	The second tranche provided the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_17_ITEM1_P44_S4	In connection with Tranche 2, the Company loaned VidaPlus $246,525.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P44_S5	Converting the investment from a loan into equity was to take place within 24 months of the date the amount of shares due to the Company pursuant to the second tranche is calculated.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	According to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of Tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under either Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	Pursuant to the Agreement, CBAI held a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S4	CBAI held that pledge until such time as it converted the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into VidaPlus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S5	CBAI was required to make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which meant that such conversion would take place around or before February 2014.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P47_S6	CBAI also held a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	The Company is entitled to an additional ownership stake of approximately 2.24% in connection with the forgoing, bringing its total ownership percentage to approximately 9.24%.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Company holds approximately 9.24% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the equity investment and loans receivable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the investment as a result of recurring and continued operating losses at VidaPlus.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Fair value of the loans receivable is determined based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by assets pledged against the loans.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Company recorded an impairment of 100% of the book value of the equity investment and convertible loan receivable.

1289496_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Previously, PharmaStem commenced suit against numerous companies involved in cord blood collection and preservation alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	In October 2003, after a jury trial, judgment was entered against certain of the Company s competitors and in favor of PharmaStem in one of those suits.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	In February 2004, PharmaStem commenced suit against Cord Partners and certain of its competitors alleging infringement of its patents.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Management of Cord Partners determined to settle, rather than to litigate, this matter.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	As a result, PharmaStem and Cord Partners entered into a Patent License Agreement in March 2004.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Pursuant to the Patent License Agreement, Cord Partners could, on a non-exclusive basis, collect, process and store cord blood utilizing PharmaStem s claimed technology and processes allegedly covered by its patents for so long as the patents may remain in effect.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	Most of the patents at issue expired in 2010.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	PharmaStem could claim, arguendo , Cord Partners is obligated under the Patent License Agreement to pay royalties to PharmaStem of 15% of all revenues generated by Cord Partners from the collection and storage of cord blood on and after January 1, 2004.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S6	Other than potential royalties, which would be disputed by Cord, no amount is payable by Cord Partners to PharmaStem.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S7	All litigation between the parties was dismissed and all prior claims were released.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S8	As of 2008, Cord ceased paying all royalties to PharmaStem.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S9	The patents have been declared void under a final decision on appeal, and as such, there is no pending litigation in this matter.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S10	As of December 31, 2014, the Company included approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 included in accrued expenses to account for this liability since 2008, though the Company disputes that it owes any royalties to Pharmastem.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P55_S11	As of September 30, 2015, and for fiscal year 2015, the Company made a one-time adjustment of the previously held amount of approximately $226,000 in accounts payable and $120,000 in accrued expenses, to its income statement as a gain on a settlement payable of $346,269.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Company relies upon a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in its business.

1289496_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Although the Company believes that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licensed intellectual property, these third party properties and technologies may not continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	The steps the Company has taken to protect its copyrights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse the Company s intellectual property.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	If this were to occur, it could harm its reputation and adversely affect its competitive position or results of operations.
1289496_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Company and CBA Properties, Inc. own various trademarks utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries.

1289496_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The Company believes that the key to its success is to increase sales of its cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services, and birth tissue related procurement services; thereby increasing its revenues and available cash.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The Company s success with regard to cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-storage of cord blood and tissue, and its efforts to educate potential customers and sell its services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Broad use and acceptance of the Company s service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	The Company may not have the resources required to promote its services and their potential benefits.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Continued commercialization of the Company s services will also require that it satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of its services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for its services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	If the Company is unable to increase market acceptance of its services, the Company may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to maintain profitability or to continue its operation.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	For the Company s birth tissue related procurement services, success will depend in a large part on the level of demand in the products being developed by the organizations for which the Company provides tissue, or ones to which the Company may provide services in the future, as well as on the Company s ability to procure birth tissue acceptable to these organizations.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If the Company is unable to meet the current or future demand of birth tissue from its sources, this emerging source of Company revenue may impact profitability and/or continuing operations.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If It Provides Poor Service, If Its Services Do Not Comply With Its Agreements Or If Its Storage Facilities Fail.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company must meet its customers service level expectations and its contractual obligations with respect to its services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Failure to do so could subject the Company to liability, as well as cause it to lose customers.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In some cases, the Company relies upon third party contractors to assist in providing its services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The Company s ability to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of its third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Any material disruption in the Company's ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition.

1289496_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The states of New York and California require that cord tissue banks be licensed as well.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	CBAI maintains the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	CBAI s third party laboratory does not maintain all of the required service licenses in the state of Maryland, but CBAI anticipates the third party laboratory will seek these licenses.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood and tissue banking or procurement services, the Company and its third party laboratory may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Because The Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, The Company s Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Its Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services the Company provides.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for the Company's services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	CBAI believes that its future success will depend largely on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of its customers.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Expectant parents may not use Company services and its services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In The Event The Company Is Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Its Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Cord blood and cord tissue banking and stem cell processing and storage is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company faces competition from other operators of cord blood and cord tissue stem cell processing and storage businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter Company markets and compete with the Company for increased market share.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Many competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than the Company currently has.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The Company has no research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such research and development activities.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than the Company, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than the Company currently attracts.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on the Company revenues and profitability.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	In the event that the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for the Company to grow its revenue and maintain its existing business.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm the Company.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Company depends on its ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If Company information systems fail to perform as expected, or if the Company suffers an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	And Stability Of The General Economy.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on its services.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of the uncollectable accounts.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Volatility In The Financial Market May Negatively Impact The Company s Ability To Access The Credit Markets.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile for microcap companies.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited or prohibitively expensive, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors if the Company requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Company Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Its Operations.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Company s success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of its management team.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The loss of their services could materially harm the Company s business because of the cost and time necessary to find a successor.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Company does not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on its Executive Officers.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Company also has other key employees who manage its operations, and if the Company were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	To the extent that the Company is smaller than its competitors and has fewer resources, the Company may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Company Could Fail to Retire Its Remaining Debt Obligation Which Could Subject the Company To A Default, And If Not Remedied, The Company s Assets Being Sold or Seized.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company settled a lawsuit in December 2014, as set forth more fully in Note 4.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Notes and Loans Payable, and Derivative Liabilities.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If the Company is unable to pay the monthly installment amount of $100,000 per the terms described in the Settlement Agreement, the Company would be in default, with increased costs and possible acceleration of the note balance in full if not remedied within a prescribed timeline.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If unable to meet default and/or acceleration conditions of the Agreement, the obligations are secured by the Company assets which could lead to the sale or seizure of Company assets.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Such an adverse outcome could be significant to the Company s results of operations and may limit the Company s ability to engage in its business activities.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Trading Of The Company Stock May Be Restricted By The Securities Exchange Commission s Penny Stock Regulations, Which May Limit A Stockholder s Ability To Buy And Sell The Company Stock.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	CBAI securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade Company securities.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P31_S6	The Company believes that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Failure To Establish And Maintain Effective Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Could Have An Adverse Effect On The Company s Business, Operating Results and Stock Price.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If CBAI is unable to maintain adequate internal controls, its business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	In October, 2009, the Company re-located its headquarters from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Company s principal office and laboratory operations are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	This facility encompasses approximately 16,523 square feet.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	The property is leased from an unaffiliated third party, whereby the original lease was for a period of five years ending September 2014.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	On January 21, 2014, the Company entered a First Amendment to Lease, which extended its lease at the property located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas (the Property ), Nevada through September 30, 2019.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	In connection with the amendment, the Company received an abatement of the entire amount of its rent for January 2014, except for CAM charges.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S6	In addition, as of October 1, 2014, the Company s monthly lease payments reverted back to their rates as they existed in June 2009, other than CAM charges, with annual adjustments thereafter as set forth in the Amendment.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S7	Moreover, the Landlord had the option to lease a portion of the premises then occupied by the Company to a third party, and if this portion is leased to a third party, the Company s monthly rent amount was to be reduced pro rata with the portion of the space leased to a third party.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S8	If the Landlord is unable to or elects not to lease a portion of the premises to a third party by November 30, 2015 and by each subsequent anniversary thereof, the Company shall receive an additional abatement of one month rent, excluding CAM charges, in December 2015, December 2016 and December 2017, respectively and as applicable.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S9	Effective May 15, 2016, the Company entered a Second Amendment to Lease.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S10	The Second Amendment to Lease sets forth that the square footage of the Property has been reduced by 380 square feet, such that the Property now consists of 16,523 square feet, confirms the abatements set forth in the First Amendment to Lease, sets forth that the Company s Common Area Maintenance Expenses and HOA costs shall be calculated based on the reduced square footage amount, and confirms that the Company s monthly rent amounts will remain unchanged from the First Amendment to Lease.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P0_S11	The Company s monthly rent payments are approximately $15,451, which includes Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges.
1289496_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company maintains fire and casualty insurance on its leased property in an amount deemed adequate by management.

1289496_17_ITEM5_P8_S0	On April 9, 2015, Cord Blood America, Inc. (the "Company") executed a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ) and a Stockholder Agreement with Red Oak Fund LP, Red Oak Long Fund, LP and Pinnacle Opportunities Fund, LP (collectively the Purchasers or Red Oak ).
1289496_17_ITEM5_P8_S1	Subsequently, on April 14, 2015, the Company and Red Oak closed the transaction.
1289496_17_ITEM5_P9_S0	Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers delivered to the Company, at Closing (defined in the Purchase Agreement), $724,000 (the Purchase Price ), and the Company delivered to the Purchasers 724,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock ).

1289496_17_ITEM5_P11_S0	As set forth in the Articles of Amendment, the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into common stock of the Company at the Conversion Rate, where each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to common stock in accordance with the number of shares of Preferred Stock they hold divided by the total shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, 724,000 shares, multiplied by the Maximum Common Converted Share Number, which is 29.9793% of the outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted and converted basis assuming the conversion of all convertible securities, including the conversion of the Preferred Stock.
1289496_17_ITEM5_P11_S1	The Preferred Stock shall not be converted until such time as there are sufficient authorized common stock shares, which are not reserved for other purposes, in order that all of the Preferred Stock can be converted to common shares.

1289496_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	CBAI defines critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require estimates and assumptions based on the Company's judgment of changing market conditions and the performance of its assets and liabilities at any given time.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	In determining which accounting policies meet this definition, the Company considered its policies with respect to the valuation of its assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Company believes the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following:
1289496_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Accounts receivable consist of the amounts due for facilitating the processing and storage of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue, and for tissue procurement services.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Accounts receivable relating to deferred revenues are netted against deferred revenue for presentation purposes.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon historical experience.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	The allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for accounts deemed uncollectible by management.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	Amounts are written off when all collection efforts have failed.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-25 (previously Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition ).
1289496_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605-25-25 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables").
1289496_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	ASC 605-25-25 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Cord recognizes revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	"Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities"), requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and in accordance with ASC 815-40-15 (formerly EITF 00-19 "Accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock") to determine whether they should be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Binomial option pricing formula and present value pricing.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Company adjusted its derivative liability to its fair value, and reflected the change in fair value, in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's total revenue decreased to $3.29 million from $5.23 million over the same period of 2015, a decrease of 37.1%.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenues are generated primarily from three sources: new enrollment/processing fees; recurring storage fees (both from cord blood and cord tissue); and services related to the procurement of birth tissue for organizations utilized in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic products.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The decrease in revenue is primarily due to a reduction in orders for procurement of birth tissue related services.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	Recurring storage revenues increased approximately 3% to $2.71 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus $2.62 million for the prior comparative year ended December 31, 2015.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P19_S4	Revenues from the procurement of birth tissue decreased to $0.17 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.73 million from the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 90%.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P19_S5	This decline is attributable to the cessation of orders for birth tissue procurement services in 2016.

1289496_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	The decline in gross profit is largely due to reduction in revenue as a result of cessation of orders for birth tissue procurement services.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Administrative and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 million as compared to $3.0 million for the comparative period of 2015, representing a 17% decrease.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	These expenses are primarily related to marketing/advertising, professional services, allocated facility, including utilities, expenses, and wages for personnel.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	The Company continues to evaluate its administrative and selling expenses for alignment with revenues.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Company's net income was $0.10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.34 million from $0.44 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

1289496_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	Total liabilities decreased by $0.68 million, primarily due to pay down of Promissory Notes.

1289496_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Cash flows from operations are currently sufficient to fund operations, though net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $0.15 million from $0.73 million from the prior comparative period of 2015.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	During the last 12 months of 2016 there was no increase in notes payable for purposes of working capital, and the Company made payments toward notes payable to Tonaquint, Inc., as more fully described in Note 4.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Notes and Loans Payable, and Derivative Liabilities.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company has incurred losses since its inception through December 31, 2014, as development and infrastructure costs were incurred in advance of obtaining customers.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	However, the Company had and has net income and positive cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Starting in 2014, the Company's management commenced a plan to reduce operating expenses to be commensurate with operating cash flows.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Prior to 2015, the Company relied on debt to provide capital for working capital needs.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management has taken several actions to ensure that the Company will continue as a going concern, including the divesture of its investment in its unconsolidated affiliates, including the sale of its 51% ownership in Stellacure GmbH and 50.004% interest in Biocordcell Argentina S.A., headcount reductions, and reductions in discretionary expenditures.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	These changes effected by the Company's management resulted in the Company generating cash flow from operations in 2015 and 2016, and the Company did not require additional debt or equity capital from external sources.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	Further, the Company has reduced its debt via the repayment of the principal balance.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	Management plans to continue to implement its business plan and to fund operations through operating revenue and a corresponding increase in the amount of net income from its operations.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	The Company expects that cash flow from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S5	Management's objective is to continue to monitor and manage expenses relative to its revenue such that it will continue to generate operating cash flows to meet its operating cash requirements.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P28_S6	Management believes that these actions will enable the Company to continue as a going concern through December 31, 2017.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Updates are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedient , which is to (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.

1289496_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1289496_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.

1289496_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	It is management's responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Company s management has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Following this review and evaluation, management collectively determined that its disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including its president and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The deficiency in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

1289496_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	The Company assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Based upon management s assessment using the criteria contained in COSO, and for the reasons discussed below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, its internal control over financial reporting was not effective.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Based on its evaluation, the Company's President and Principal Financial Officer identified a major deficiency that existed in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that it considers to be a material weakness .
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P9_S1	The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P9_S2	The material weakness was first identified at the beginning of 2007 and remained unchanged through December 31, 2016.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	The deficiency in the Company's internal control is related to a lack of segregation of duties due to the size of the accounting department and the lack of experienced accountants due to the limited financial resources of the Company.
1289496_17_ITEM9A_P10_S1	The Company continues to actively develop the controls and resources necessary in order to be in position to remediate this lack of segregation of duties.

1289496_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances are more likely than not to reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	Inventory, comprised principally of finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	This policy requires the Company to make estimates regarding the market value of its inventory, including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company determines excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated selling prices for its products.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	Notes receivable consists of the notes due from Biocordcell Argentina S.A. (BioCells) and Banco Vida.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	The notes receivable are recorded at carrying-value on the financial statements.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	For note receivable from BioCells, since the Company agreed to finance the sale of the shares in Biocordcell at no stated interest, in accordance with ASC 500, the interest method was applied using a 6% borrowing rate.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company recorded an unamortized discount based on the 6% borrowing rate and the discount is amortized throughout the life of the note.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Deferred revenue consists of payments for enrollment in the program and processing of umbilical cord blood and cord tissue by customers whose samples have not yet been collected, as well as the pro-rata share of annual storage fees for customers whose samples were stored during the year.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	ASC 815-40 requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and in accordance with ASC 815-40-15 to determine whether they should be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Binomial option pricing formula and present value pricing.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company adjusted its derivative liability to its fair value, and reflected the change in fair value, in its consolidated statements of operations.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	CBAI recognizes revenue under the provisions of ASC 605.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	CBAI provides a combination of products and services to customers.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	This combination arrangement is evaluated under ASC 605.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	ASC 605 addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements under multiple revenue generating activities.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	Cord recognizes revenue from both enrollment fees and processing fees upon the completion of processing while revenue from storage fees are recognized ratably over the contractual storage period.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Costs are incurred as umbilical cord blood, cord tissue and birth tissue are collected.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	These costs include the transportation of the umbilical cord blood, cord tissue and birthing tissue from the hospital, direct material, costs for processing and cryogenic storage of new samples by a third party laboratory, collection kit materials and allocated rent, utility and general administrative expenses.

1289496_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P39_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P39_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P39_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that included the enactment date.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P39_S4	The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance based on the portion of tax benefits that more likely than not will not be realized.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P39_S5	There was a valuation allowance equal to 100% of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company follows guidance issued by the FASB with regard to its accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	Such guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P40_S2	In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taxing authorities.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	Interest and penalties totaled $0 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

1289496_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been exercised.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Company s common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS if the effect is anti-dilutive.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P44_S3	The diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are 1,272,066,146 and 1,272,066,146 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	Concentrations of credit risk (whether on or off balance sheet) that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions described below.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Relationships and agreements which could potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of the use of one source for the processing and storage of all umbilical cord blood and one source for the development and maintenance of a website.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company believes that alternative sources are available for each of these concentrations.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk could consist of cash balances maintained in excess of federal depository insurance limits.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high credit quality financial institutions.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	At times, cash and cash equivalent balances may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits, and as of December 31, 2016, such excess was less than $250,000.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P47_S3	To date, the Company has not experienced any such losses.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	Level inputs, as defined by ASC 820, are as follows:
1289496_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	Level 2 other significant observable inputs for the assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	Level 3 significant unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2016 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1289496_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	Derivative liability was valued under the Binomial model with the following assumptions:
1289496_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at December 31, 2015 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
1289496_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	Derivative liability was valued under the Binomial model, with the following assumptions:
1289496_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenues, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	The carrying amounts of the Company s notes receivable and notes payable approximates fair value based on the prevailing interest rates.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P57_S1	The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P57_S2	The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P57_S3	Updates are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P57_S4	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P58_S2	The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P58_S3	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedient , which is to (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determiningthe transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , in an effort to reduce the diversity of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.

1289496_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	The amount of the monthly payments is $100,000 (the Installment Amount ); provided, however, that if the remaining amount owing under the Company Note as of the applicable Installment Date (defined in the Company Note) is less than $100,000, then the Installment Amount for such Installment Date shall be equal to the outstanding amount.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P67_S2	The Company may prepay any or all of the outstanding amount of the Company Note at any time, without penalty.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P67_S3	In the event the Company prepays an amount that is less than the outstanding amount, then the prepayment amount shall be applied to the next Installment Amount(s) due under the Company Note.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	For each monthly payment, the Company may elect to designate all or any portion of the Installment Amount then due as a conversion eligible amount (hereafter Conversion Eligible Amount ); provided that the total outstanding Conversion Eligible Amount that has not been converted by Tonaquint, as set forth below, at any given time may not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) without Tonaquint s prior written consent and subject to additional restrictions set forth in the Company Note.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	In the event the Company designates any portion of any monthly payment amount as a Conversion Eligible Amount, the applicable monthly payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion thereof designated as a Conversion Eligible Amount.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P68_S2	The Conversion Eligible Amount shall continue to be included in and be deemed to be a part of the Outstanding Balance (defined in the Company Note) of the Company Note unless and until such amount is either paid in cash by the Company or converted into Common Stock by Tonaquint.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P68_S3	The Company may pay the Conversion Eligible Amount in cash, provided that no prepayments of cash shall reduce the Conversion Eligible Amount until the Outstanding Balance is equal to or less than the Conversion Eligible Amount.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	Once the Company has designated amounts as Conversion Eligible Amount, Tonaquint may convert all or any portion of that amount into shares of the Company's Common Stock.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	In the event of a conversion by Tonaquint of a Conversion Eligible Amount, the number of Common Stock shares delivered to Tonaquint upon conversion will be calculated by dividing the amount of the Company Note that is being converted by 70% of the average of the three (3) lowest Closing Bid Prices of the Common Stock (as defined in the Company Note) in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	The Company records debt discounts in connection with the issuance of convertible debt and the initial valuation of the derivative liability.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	The discounts are amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the debt.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company Note has an interest rate of 7.5%, compounding daily, which would increase to a rate of 15.0% on the happening of certain Events of Default (defined in the Company Note) that are not considered a Payment Default (defined in the Company Note), provided that the Company may cure the default in accordance with and subject to the terms set forth in the Company Note.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Where a Payment Default occurs, including where (i) Borrower shall fail to pay any principal, interest, fees, charges, or any other amount when due and payable under that Company Note; or (ii) Borrower shall fail to deliver any Conversion Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Note, late fees shall accrue as set forth in the Company Note, and in addition, the Company shall have ninety (90) days from delivery of notice of default from Tonaquint to cure the default, as set forth in more detail in the Company Note.
1289496_17_ITEM15_P71_S2	If the Company fails to cure the Payment Default, Tonaquint may accelerate the Company Note by written notice to the Company, with the Outstanding Balance becoming immediately due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount (defined in the Company Note) equal to (i) the Outstanding Balance as of the date of acceleration (which Outstanding Balance, for the avoidance of doubt, will include all Late Fees that accrue until any applicable Payment Default is cured) multiplied by (ii) two hundred fifty percent (250%), along with other remedies, as set forth in the Company Note.

1289496_17_ITEM15_P76_S3	The second tranche provided the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_17_ITEM15_P76_S4	In connection with Tranche 2, the Company loaned VidaPlus $246,525.

1289496_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Despite this classification, we have included the disclosure below under Business as it describes our current business and the closing of the sale of substantially all of our assets is subject to satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions including shareholder approval, of which there can be no assurances.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	The human body is comprised of many types of cells with individual characteristics and specific functions.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Cells with a defined or specialized function are referred to as differentiated.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Examples of differentiated cells include nerve cells, red blood cells and skin cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Differentiated cells are replaced and renewed over time from a population of rare, undifferentiated cells known as stem cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	As stem cells grow and proliferate, they are capable of producing both additional stem cells as well as cells that have differentiated to perform a specific function.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	Stem cell differentiation is prompted by specific cell-to-cell interactions or other molecular signals.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	These signals trigger a change in the cell s genetic profile, causing specific genes to become active and others to become inactive.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	As a result, the cell develops specialized structures, features and functions representative of its differentiated cell type.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	There are many types of stem cells in the human body.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	These stem cells are found in different concentrations and in different locations in the body during a person s lifetime.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	Current thinking suggests that each organ and tissue in the body is founded, maintained and possibly rejuvenated to different degrees, on a more or less continual basis, by specific stem cell populations naturally present in the body.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells reside in the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placenta.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	They can also be found in an infant s umbilical cord as well as circulating in very small numbers in the blood.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Hematopoietic stem cells generate all other blood and immune system cells in the body.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Neural stem cells can be found in the brain and spinal cord and are capable of differentiating into nerve and brain tissue.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Mesenchymal stem cells can be found in bone marrow, cord tissue and adipose tissue and differentiate into bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and other connective tissues.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Pancreatic islet stem cells can be found in the pancreas and differentiate into specialized cells of the pancreas including cells that secrete insulin.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	The ability of a stem cell to differentiate into multiple types of cells of a certain tissue is referred to as pluripotency.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	For example, a hematopoietic stem cell has the ability to differentiate into many types of blood and immune system cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	However, stem cells of one tissue type may also generate specialized cells of another tissue type, a characteristic referred to as plasticity.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	For example, under specific conditions, hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to generate specialized cells of other systems, including neural, endocrine, skeletal, respiratory and cardiac systems.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	These characteristics make stem cells highly flexible and useful for a number of applications, including the potential use as therapeutics.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Cell therapy is the use of live cells as therapeutic agents to treat disease.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	This therapy involves the introduction of cells to replace or initiate the production of other cells that are missing or damaged due to disease.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	Currently, the most common forms of cell therapy include blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow transplants.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Bone marrow transplantation is a medical procedure in which hematopoietic stem cells are introduced into the body in order to regenerate healthy, functioning bone marrow.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	In this procedure, stem cells are obtained from a donor through a surgical procedure to remove bone marrow.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	The donated bone marrow, including any captured stem cells, is then transfused into the patient.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	Stem cells for transplantation may also be obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood donations.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P24_S4	Sometimes the stem cells used in the procedure are obtained from the patient s own bone marrow or blood.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other serious diseases since the 1960s.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The flexibility and plasticity of stem cells has led many researchers to believe that stem cells have tremendous promise in the treatment of diseases other than those currently addressed by stem cell procedures.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Researchers have reported progress in the development of new therapies utilizing stem cells for the treatment of cancer, neurological, immunological, genetic, cardiac, pancreatic, liver and degenerative diseases.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The success of current and emerging cell therapies is dependent on the presence of a rich and abundant source of stem cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Umbilical cord blood has been emerging as an ideal source for these cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	As information about the potential therapeutic value of stem cells has entered the mainstream, and following the first successful cord blood transplant performed in 1988, cord blood collection has grown.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	In the past decades, multiple public and private cord blood banks have been established to provide for the collection and storage of these cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Public cord blood banks collect and store umbilical cord blood donated by women at the birth of the child.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	This blood is stored and made available for a significant fee to an unrelated individual who matches the cord blood stored.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Company does not currently collect or store donated cord blood units.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	Private, or family cord blood banks such as Cord, collect and store umbilical cord blood on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P29_S4	This blood is stored and made available to the family in the event the family needs stem cells for a transplant.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	An emerging source of stem cells found in the umbilical cord tissue for therapeutic use are Mesenchymal stem cells.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Mesenchymal stem cells, which are abundant in the cord tissue, possess the ability to regenerate into connective tissues including nerves, bones, muscles and ligaments.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	While there are currently no clinically approved use for these stem cells, there are clinical trials underway, and many scientists view this source of stem cells as promising resource in the field of regenerative medicine.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	In more recent years, many of the private or family cord blood banks have begun offering cord tissue related processing and storage services on a fee-for-service basis for families.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	Private cord blood banks typically offer to store a whole segment of the cord tissue, or a service where the Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the cord tissue, expanded, and then cryogenically stored.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P30_S5	Cord facilitates whole segment cord tissue processing and storage services.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Cord s operations facilitate umbilical cord blood banking and cord tissue services to expectant parents.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Company s corporate headquarters re-located to Las Vegas, NV from Los Angeles, CA in October 2009.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Cord earns revenue through a one-time enrollment and processing fee, and through an annually recurring storage and maintenance fee.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Cord facilitates processing and storage of cord blood and cord tissue for new customers through an engagement with a third party laboratory.

1289496_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	This procedure ensures chain-of-custody control during transportation for maximum security.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	The cord blood sample is tested by third parties engaged by Cord for stem cell concentration levels and blood type.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	The maternal samples are tested for infectious diseases.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	Cord reports results to the newborn s mother.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	After processing and testing, the cord blood and cord tissue unit is cryogenically frozen in a controlled manner and stored in liquid nitrogen for potential future use.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	For new customers, this process is conducted at a third party laboratory.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Additionally, the Company provides services related to procuring birth tissue for organizations utilizing the tissue in the transplantation and/or research of therapeutic based products.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Company receives a one-time recovery fee per tissue.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	Associated services provided by the Company with this offering may include arranging for transportation, providing collection materials, facilitating information used to determine donor eligibility and arranging for infectious disease testing of the maternal blood.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Going forward, management will continue to assess business opportunities, and plans to pursue customer acquisition, primarily through organic growth.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	In March 2010 the Company acquired, pursuant to a License Agreement, a 10% non-dilutive interest in what became, in December 2010, China Stem Cells, Ltd., a Cayman Islands Company (hereinafter "Cayman"), which indirectly holds a 100% capital interest in AXM Shenyang, a company organized to conduct a Stem Cell Storage Business in China.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	In exchange for issuance of equity interest in Cayman, under the terms of the Transfer of Technology Agreement the Company agreed to provide technology transfer, knowhow and training in the setup, marketing and operation of the China Stem Cell Storage business.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	In connection with the License Agreement, the Company will receive royalties equal to 8.5% of "Net Revenues" realized from the China Stem Cell Storage business, over the 15 year term of the agreement, with certain minimum annual royalties payable beginning in 2011.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	The Company has not been paid any royalty balance due to date, and it remains doubtful that any such royalties will be collected.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	In December 2010 the Company also acquired the option to provide up to $750,000 of additional capital funding to Cayman through the purchase of Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes and attached Cayman Warrants to acquire its Common Stock.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Other Cayman shareholders were granted similar options, with the intent of raising the aggregate up to $1.5 million in additional capital for Cayman and its subsidiaries.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	As of December 31, 2017, Cord Blood has exercised this option in part, and provided a total of $400,000 in additional capital to Cayman in 2011 and 2012, and received Cayman Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for this sum along with 50 Cayman Warrants.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	The Secured Convertible Promissory Notes are convertible into Cayman stock at a conversion price of $1,500 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	The Warrants, which were exercisable at an option exercise price of $0.05 per share per share, subject to certain adjustments, expired unexercised on March 31, 2015.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P43_S3	The Company recorded a reserve for the entire carrying value of the receivable of $458,706, including interest, as of December 31, 2017.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement ), with the Shareholders of Biocordcell Argentina S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of Argentina ( Bio ), providing for the Company s acquisition of 50.004% of the outstanding shares of Bio (the Shares).
1289496_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	On September 29, 2014, the Company closed a transaction whereby it sold its ownership stake in BioCells, amounting to 50.004% of the outstanding shares of BioCells to Diego Rissola (Purchaser), who is the current President and Chairman of the Board of BioCells and a shareholder prior to the transaction.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Under the Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to pay the total amount of $705,000, as follows:

1289496_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Purchaser is current with the payment schedule as of December 31, 2017.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire up to 51% of the capital stock in VidaPlus, an umbilical cord processing and storage company headquartered in Madrid, Spain.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Agreement is organized into three tranches; the first executed at closing with an initial investment of approximately $204,000 (150,000 Euro) for an amount equivalent to 7% as follows; 1% of share capital in initial equity or approximately $30,000 and 6% or an estimated $174,000 as a loan convertible into equity within 12 months of closing.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	The initial investment was secured by a Pledge Agreement on 270 VidaPlus samples that were incurring annual storage fees.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	The second tranche provided the opportunity for an additional 28% in share capital through monthly investments based on the number of samples processed in that month (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_18_ITEM1_P49_S4	In connection with Tranche 2, the Company loaned VidaPlus $246,525.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P49_S5	Converting the investment from a loan into equity was to take place within 24 months of the date the amount of shares due to the Company pursuant to the second tranche is calculated.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	According to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the third tranche follows a similar loan to equity agreement as tranche two but for an additional 16% equity at the option of the Company (up to a maximum of 550,000 EUR).
1289496_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	In connection with the VidaPlus Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on January 24, 2011, the Company was obligated to make monthly loans to VidaPlus based on the number of new samples processed and up to a maximum of 550,000 Euro for each of Tranche 2 and 3 of the Agreement.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Tranche 2 did contain provisions that provided the Company an option to discontinue funding if certain performance targets were not met.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	In January 2012, the Company exercised its right to convert its Tranche 1 loan into 6% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus, and as a result, the Company owned a total of 7% of the outstanding shares.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	At the time of the equity conversion, the Company no longer maintained its Pledge on the 270 VidaPlus samples associated with Tranche 1; however, the Company maintained a liquidation preference in VidaPlus over the money invested by the Company in VidaPlus.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	Additionally, the Company declined to make any further investment (loan or otherwise) to VidaPlus under either Tranche 2, Tranche 3 or otherwise.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	Pursuant to the Agreement, CBAI held a pledge over the umbilical cord blood maintenance and storage contracts between VidaPlus and certain of its customers, and all rights contained therein, including but not limited to the rights to administer those contracts and the rights to collect the revenues derived from those contracts, for 328 samples.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	CBAI held that pledge until such time as it converted the monies paid to VidaPlus under Tranche 2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement into equity into VidaPlus, in accordance with the formulas set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S5	CBAI was required to make that conversion within two years of when the calculation was made as to the amount of shares to which CBAI is entitled pursuant to Tranche 2, which meant that such conversion would take place around or before February 2014.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P52_S6	CBAI also held a liquidation preference in VidaPlus for the money the Company invested in VidaPlus.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	On February 14, 2014, CBAI delivered to VidaPlus its election to convert its loan under Tranche 2 into shares of stock in VidaPlus, including Anti-Dilution shares.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	The Company is entitled to an additional ownership stake of approximately 2.24% in connection with the forgoing, bringing its total ownership percentage to approximately 9.24%.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Company holds approximately 9.24% of the outstanding shares of VidaPlus and has a balance of convertible loans receivable amounting to $246,525.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the equity investment and loans receivable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the investment as a result of recurring and continued operating losses at VidaPlus.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	Fair value of the loans receivable is determined based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by assets pledged against the loans.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Company recorded an impairment of 100% of the book value of the equity investment and convertible loan receivable.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Patents, Trademarks, Licenses or Royalty Agreements.
1289496_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Company relies upon a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in its business.

1289496_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We Have Not Determined The Amount Of Any Distributions Subsequent To The Closing Of The Proposed Transaction With FamilyCord.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	In connection with the closing of the Purchase Agreement, FamilyCord has agreed to pay a purchase price of $15,500,000.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Upon completion of the transaction, CBAI presently estimates it will distribute a portion of the sale proceeds to its shareholders.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The initial distribution amount will be determined by CBAI s board of directors and will be subject to such factors as taxes payable, operating expenses, and other contingences and estimates.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Additional monies may be distributed over time based on cash available and the release of known and unknown liabilities.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Given cash needed for the aforementioned expenses and contingencies, total proceeds paid out to shareholders are expected to be significantly less than the gross purchase price.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Company May Not Be Able To Increase Sales Or Otherwise Successfully Operate Its Business, Which Could Have A Significant Negative Impact On Its Financial Condition.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The Company believes that the key to its success is to increase sales of its cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services; thereby increasing its revenues and available cash.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The Company s success with regard to cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage services will depend in large part on widespread market acceptance of cryo-storage of cord blood and tissue, and its efforts to educate potential customers and sell its services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Broad use and acceptance of the Company s service requires marketing expenditures and education and awareness of consumers and medical practitioners.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The Company may not have the resources required to promote its services and their potential benefits.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Continued commercialization of the Company s services will also require that it satisfactorily address the needs of various medical practitioners that constitute a target market to reach consumers of its services and to address potential resistance to recommendations for its services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If the Company is unable to increase market acceptance of its services, the Company may be unable to generate enough additional revenue to maintain profitability or to continue its operation.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If It Provides Poor Service, If Its Services Do Not Comply With Its Agreements Or If Its Storage Facilities Fail.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Company must meet its customers service level expectations and its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to its services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Failure to do any of these could subject the Company to liability, as well as cause it to lose customers.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In some cases, the Company relies upon third party contractors to assist in providing its services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The Company s ability to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations may be impacted by the performance of its third party contractors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the Company incurs significant liability with regards to any of the foregoing, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Any material disruption in the Company's ability to maintain continued, uninterrupted and fully operating storage systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The Company systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, break-ins, tornadoes and similar events.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The Company may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and/or liability insurance to compensate for losses and claims that might occur in the event of such an interruption.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Cyber Attacks And Breaches Could Cause Operational Disruptions, Fraud Or Theft of Sensitive Information.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Aspects of our operations are reliant upon internet-based activities, such as ordering supplies and back-office functions such as accounting and transaction processing, making and accepting payments, processing payroll and other administrative functions, etc.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Although we have taken measures to protect our technology systems and infrastructure, including employee education programs regarding cybersecurity, a breach of the security surrounding these functions could result in operational disruptions, theft or fraud, or exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Such events could result in additional costs related to operational inefficiencies, or damages, claims or fines.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If The Company Does Not Obtain And Maintain Necessary Domestic Regulatory Registrations, Approvals And Comply With Ongoing Regulations, It May Not Be Able To Market Its Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking Services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The cord blood and cord tissue banking services, and tissue procurement services that the Company provides are currently subject to FDA regulations requiring infectious disease testing.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The facility the Company operates has registered with the FDA as a cord blood and cord tissue banking service and tissue procurement service.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Its products and services are registered with the FDA, and are subject to FDA inspection.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The FDA has established a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products as well as rules for donor suitability.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Consistent with industry practice, the Company s collection kits have not been cleared as a medical device.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	CBAI s activities are regulated by the FDA under 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Procedures for all steps that the Company performs in testing, screening and determination of donor eligibility must be established and maintained requiring additional resources, staff and management oversight.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Significant costs are associated with maintaining compliance in accordance with current regulatory requirements.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The Company may not be able to comply with any future regulatory requirements, including product standards that may be developed after the date hereof.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Moreover, the cost of compliance with government regulations may adversely affect revenue and profitability.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, injunctions, operating restrictions, and civil fines and criminal prosecution.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Delays or failure to obtain registrations could have a material adverse effect on the marketing and sales of services and impair the ability to operate profitably in the future.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Of the states in which the Company provides services, only California, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland currently require that cord blood banks be licensed.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The states of New York and California require that cord tissue banks be licensed as well.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	CBAI maintains the required procurement service licenses of the states of California, New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	CBAI s third party laboratory does not maintain all of the required service licenses in the state of Maryland, but CBAI anticipates the third party laboratory will seek these licenses.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If other states adopt requirements for the licensing of cord blood and tissue banking or procurement services, the Company and its third party laboratory may have to obtain licenses to continue providing services in those states.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Because The Industry Is Subject To Rapid Technological And Therapeutic Changes And New Developments, The Company s Future Success Will Depend On The Continued Viability Of The Use Of Stem Cells And Its Ability To Respond To The Changes.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The use of stem cells in the treatment of disease is a relatively new technology and is subject to potentially revolutionary technological, medical and therapeutic changes.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Future technological and medical developments could render the use of stem cells obsolete.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, there may be significant advances in other treatment methods, such as genetics, or in disease prevention techniques, which could significantly reduce the need for the services the Company provides.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Therefore, changes in technology could affect the market for the Company's services and necessitate changes to those services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	CBAI believes that its future success will depend largely on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes, to offer on a timely basis, services that meet these evolving standards and demand of its customers.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Expectant parents may not use Company services and its services may not provide competitive advantages with current or future technologies.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Failure to achieve increased market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In The Event The Company Is Unable To Compete Against Larger Competitors, Its Business Could Be Adversely Affected.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Cord blood and cord tissue banking and stem cell processing and storage is becoming an increasingly competitive business.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Company faces competition from other operators of cord blood and cord tissue stem cell processing and storage businesses and providers of cord blood and stem cell storage services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter Company markets and compete with the Company for increased market share.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Many competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with clients, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than the Company currently has.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	The Company has no research and development underway, while other competitors have established budgets for such research and development activities.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Established competitors, who have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories than the Company, are able to engage in more substantial advertising and promotion and attract a greater number of customers and business than the Company currently attracts.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	While this competition is already intense, if it increases, it could have an even greater adverse impact on the Company revenues and profitability.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	In the event that the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be adversely affected and competition may make it more difficult for the Company to grow its revenue and maintain its existing business.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	And A Failure Of Those Systems Could Materially Harm the Company.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Company depends on its ability to store, retrieve, process and manage a significant amount of information.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If Company information systems fail to perform as expected, or if the Company suffers an interruption, malfunction or loss of information processing capabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	And Stability Of The General Economy.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession, or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for the Company s services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	For example, economic forces may cause consumers to withhold discretionary dollars that might otherwise be spent on its services.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of the uncollectable accounts.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Volatility In The Financial Market May Negatively Impact The Company s Ability To Access The Credit Markets.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile for microcap companies.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited or prohibitively expensive, it is possible that the Company s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, through the private placement of shares, debt and/or convertible debt may be limited by these factors if the Company requires such sources of additional capital in order to continue its operations, fund negative cash flow, and implement its business plans.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Company Could Fail To Attract Or Retain Key Personnel, Which Could Be Detrimental To Its Operations.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Company s success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of its management team.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The loss of their services could materially harm the Company s business because of the cost and time necessary to find a successor.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Such a loss would also divert management s attention away from operational issues.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The Company does not presently maintain key-man life insurance policies on its Executive Officers.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The Company also has other key employees who manage its operations, and if the Company were to lose their services, senior management would be required to expend time and energy to find and train their replacements.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	To the extent that the Company is smaller than its competitors and has fewer resources, the Company may not be able to attract sufficient number and quality of staff.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Trading Of The Company Stock May Be Restricted By The Securities Exchange Commission s Penny Stock Regulations, Which May Limit A Stockholder s Ability To Buy And Sell The Company Stock.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	CBAI securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors .
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade Company securities.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P32_S6	The Company believes that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Failure To Establish And Maintain Effective Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Could Have An Adverse Effect On The Company s Business, Operating Results and Stock Price.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If CBAI is unable to maintain adequate internal controls, its business and operating results could be harmed.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Trading In Our Common Stock Could Be Further Limited Upon The Closing Of The Sale Of Substantially All Of Our Assets To FamilyCord.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Upon closing of the transaction with FamilyCord, the Company will have no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets and will therefore considered to be a Shell Company as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of Exchange Act.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of shell companies in their respective jurisdictions.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, the ability to rely on Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended as an exemption from registration for the resale of stock is prohibited while a Company is a shell company.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Such statutes, rules and regulations may make it more difficult to sell our securities.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	There Can Be No Assurance That The Proposed Transaction With FamilyCord Will Be Consummated As Contemplated In Accordance With The Definitive Merger Agreement.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	There can be no assurances that the proposed transaction with FamilyCord will be consummated as originally contemplated, or that the Company will realize any or all of the benefits that the management expected to realize upon the consummation of the transaction.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	And Its Future Business And Financial Results .
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	There can be no assurances that the transaction with FamilyCord will be consummated as originally contemplated.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If the transaction is not completed, the Company s ongoing business could be adversely affected, and it would be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the transaction, including the following:
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the transaction.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If the transaction is not completed, these risks could materially affect the Company s business and financial results and the price of its common stock.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The Pendency Of The Transaction With FamilyCord Could Adversely Affect The Company s Business And Operations.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Prior to consummation of the transaction with FamilyCord, some of the Company s business relationships may delay, defer or withdraw their business with the Company, which could negatively affect revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the transaction with FamilyCord is completed.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company, which may materially adversely affect the Company s ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the transaction with FamilyCord.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, due to operating restrictions in the Purchase Agreement, the Company may be unable, during the pendency of the transaction with FamilyCord to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions, even if such actions would prove beneficial.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Which, If Not Satisfied Or Waived In A Timely Manner, Would Delay The Transaction Or Adversely Impact Our Ability To Complete The Transactions .
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The completion of the proposed transaction with FamilyCord is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the receipt of the approval of the Purchase Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	While it is currently anticipated that the Purchase Agreement will be completed in the second quarter of 2018, there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Restrictions on the transfer of our common stock could inhibit certain transactions that may be beneficial to shareholders.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In order to preserve our tax benefit carryforwards, we are seeking shareholder approval of a proposed amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation which would generally prohibit the transfer of our common stock and other corporate securities if such a transfer would result in (i) a party having an ownership interest of 4.9% or greater in the Company or (ii) an increased ownership interest of a party that already has an ownership interest of 4.9% or greater in the Company.
1289496_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	This restriction, if approved by our shareholders, could inhibit or prevent certain transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to stockholders.
1289496_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s principal office and laboratory operations are located at 1857 Helm Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119.

1289496_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
1289496_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm the Company s business.
1289496_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	On March 14, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with regards to a lawsuit filed against the Company in 2017 in Clark County, Nevada District Court relating to a claim over unpaid compensation.
1289496_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	As part of the settlement agreement, the Company made an $80,000 payment to the party that filed the lawsuit which will be reflected as an expense and a liability (until paid) in the Company s financial statements as of December 31, 2017.

1289496_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	There are legal restrictions which preclude the Company's ability to pay cash dividends on its common shares so long as it has an accumulated deficit.
1289496_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	The Company does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, provided, however, if the closing of the Purchase Agreement is consummated, the Company anticipates distributing a portion of the proceeds to its shareholders.
1289496_18_ITEM5_P4_S3	However, there can be no assurance as to the amount of such distribution and any such distribution will be significantly less than the gross purchase price paid in the transaction with FamilyCord.

1289496_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
